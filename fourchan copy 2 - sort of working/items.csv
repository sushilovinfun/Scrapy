The closest thing to that would be aerobics.,Meh, formation flying through loops and such would be just as fun...,How costly is a glider licence?,It depends on the place where you do it and how good you are at it. I got my license for 36 000 czech crowns (which is about 1400 euros). After the basic training, it is relatively cheap (the better you are, the cheaper it gets),do you fly competitively?,Yes, I do.,I'll look into it once I move out...

Looks like a lot of fun.,did they hire an actual referee? cause that ref is like 40 years old and i doubt is just a casual friend,This. I want to see some real companies use that sometime,OP if you are involved with these guys or are possibly one of them. You guys need to work on the way you carry yourselves in the ring. Some movements and transitions looked sloppy and just lazy. Put more energy and effort into the way you carry yourselves and execute things.,This mainly refers to the guy in green.

"Any long-boarders here?,I need some kind of better arm guards, any advice?,new longboarder here. i decided on my first deck. bought the earthwing supermodel earlier.,what are the absolute best trucks for $60ish for cruise/freestyle?,btw the supermodel i got is 40"" 9 ply,The supermodel is a decent deck because it can do a little bit of everything, however as far as trucks go you won't feel a difference in Paris, Randal, Bear or Gullwing (All around $50) unless you are going past 30 mph- I would recommend Pairs v2's or Bears just because they are better set for DH or Freeride compared to any other multi purpose 50* truck, however if you are willing to spend $60 on trucks, I would spend $25 extra on Cast Ronins just to be a showoff even though they would not be good for freestyle.,""longboarder"" reporting in,i skate everything from downhill to street decks but i do a lot of freeride mostly. ,Comet Greaseshark and Lifelong Seeker,Been longboarding for a year and skating in general for 4 years.,the supermodel is designed for bears or indy 215s. i ride indy/core hybrids for the longer kingpin to set up larger bushings.

Don't get v1, because they will bend like its their job,that's original,unless its an arbiter, maven, or drop freeride, originals are shitty and overpriced,Indy 215's are perfect for the Supermodel. They're what t was designed around and they're tons of fun as a beginner truck. You won't be able to handle any serious downhill on them but they kick ass for freeride.,And even in the few cases where they're not shitty and overpriced they're still just overpriced.,downhill freeride,why do i only see kids riding longboards nowadays. you can't shred the same way as you can with a normal deck. i understand the chill factor of it, but the possibilities seem limited. no flip tricks, grinding, or anything like that. i'm at a loss., you can do anything on a longboard that you can on a street deck because there is so much verity. You don't see to much of that because most of us are trying to get away from the trick aspect and trying one thing over and over.

"I know it s a long shot but I anyone can do it you guys,What is the martial art that Snake uses in MGS2 ?,From the combos I think its kickbox but you would know better,It's a unique in-universe style simply called CQC, close-quarters combat.,Isn't Snake told he didnt use CQC until 4th game,Of course its a game they maybe didn't use any technique but they used military experts for shooting and sneaking animations,I thought maybe they used real martial arts experts for fighting,I don't recall snake using anything other than the kick punch combo in this game, outside of the gunplay.,I think its referred to as ""spam M9 heatshots"",Did you even play the fucking games?,not OP but solid snake does not use CQC until mgs4,OP didn't specify ""solid snake"", just ""snake"". Pretty sure it is referred to as CQC in MGS3.,cardboard box,I haven't played MGS4 but from playing MGS3 pathologically/no guns I'd say CQC looks most like a form of aikido/jujitsu (sometimes expressed/taught as aikijujitsu, as they have some overlap). Note: not jujitsu like BJJ, which is mostly about ground game, but traditional japanese jujitsu which in my experience is split equally into joint locks, throws/takedowns, and ground game and blending those into each other.,Think joint locks, countering just about anything an opponent throws at you and using it to knock them to the ground, throws/takedowns, and chokes - you use a ton of these in MGS3, especially the final boss fight, if you're playing the game ""right"".,The MGS wiki says it's similar to judo. Some enemies in the game have lines to the effect of ""I'm tired of your judo"" and ""What is that, some kind of judo?"",he specified mgs2,It's probably part of the jujutsu family (judo's war-vet daddy). Jujutsu fathered many martial arts that can all look like ""judo"" to the average person (judo is the most widely known of all of them). ,The jujutsu family:,It's probably not aikido or judo as those have little to no striking in practice, BJJ doesn't deal with weapons, and it's not karate, because karate looks like karate, not judo.,My money is on Systemma or Aikijutsu.",,"03/29/13(Fri)17:23,03/29/13(Fri)17:32,03/29/13(Fri)17:34,03/29/13(Fri)17:42,03/29/13(Fri)18:20,03/30/13(Sat)02:02,03/30/13(Sat)02:34,03/30/13(Sat)19:16,03/30/13(Sat)19:33,03/30/13(Sat)19:56,03/30/13(Sat)20:06,04/01/13(Mon)01:33,04/02/13(Tue)07:36","Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,JoeHawksⓌⓄⒷ ⓌⓄⒷ ��(...) , ,03/30/13(Sat)19:33 ,JoeHawksⓌⓄⒷ ⓌⓄⒷ ⓉⒾⓁ ⒹⒺⒶⓉⒽ,!!6SD0R629UW7,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"

"Can we get a Kung Fu thread going?,There's MMA and Boxing, as well as Krav Maga, but I see no Kung Fu!,A real martial artist is proficient in both fighting techniques as well as the beautiful, artistic side of their art! Where most karate and tae kwon do schools fall short is their artistic merit -- when they begin to spar, they forget their teachings and resort to mere kickboxing techniques!,Know this: a good fighter and a good martial artist are two different things. The fighter will win a fight, yes -- but the martial artist will win a fight with grace and beauty as well as tenacity!,Then you're either blind or to stupid to use the catalog function. There are several threads around.,I practice Northern Shaolin and plan to soon begin practicing Southern Praying Mantis because I've got to move away from where I am now. My sifu's sifu traveled across China before WWII learning skills from the greatest martial artists of both Southern and Northern styles. During the Japanese invasion, he would teach his techniques to laypeople so that they could defend themselves. I believe that martial artists should all be of such moral goodness.,These sports -- MMA, for example -- are corruptions of an art, focusing only on the fighting aspect of martial arts. They disgust me.,You just butthurt that someone with 3 months of muay thai and judo training would be able to fuck a kung ubermaster up.,Sure, learning strictly through form practice takes longer to master, but it allows the kung fu artist to truly show their art while fighting. Someone with 1 year Judo experience would probably out-fight someone with the same experience in kung fu, but if both had 10 years experience the kung fu artist would become the better fighter.,The first three years of kung fu training is supposed to be entirely conditioning.,I'm a practitioner of Ving Tsun (wing chun), 4 generation student of the Moy Yat lineage (Yip Man> Moy Yat> Moy Tung> Aaron Vyvial> Me), People always put things in terms of years of study but truly to equate experience and skill one should look at it like learning to fly: your Kung fu is equal to the number of hours of intensive training...,If it wasn't for the fact that 10 years of experience in Muay Thai leaves the practitioner without joints...,I can't agree with your argument here. You say 10 years leaves Kungfu better off.. whats your basis for saying this?,The beauty in a martial art is a well-executed technique. If it's just some flashy shit that doesn't work, it should be dumped.,Guess that means their shit doesn't actually work.,In the movies, yes. Not in real life.,I think he means to say that short term Muay Thai will make you a better fighter at the cost of longevity, when compared to Kung Fu. the problem is that comparing Muay Thai to ""Kung fu"" as a general idea is the same as comparing Muay Thai to ""martial arts"". Like comparing a fork to ""silver wear"".,Well, without arguing the better fighter, the cost of Muay Thai is certain.,You are correct, the OP should clarify what type of Kung Fu they mean...,I think here is a good point to define three categories: sport martial art, martial art, and martial science...,You wanna start then? I have some idea what you mean, but what would you call marital science..,To wit: Sport Martial Arts- combat sports that focus primarily on point marking within a regulated rule set with a secondary focus on technique or form.,Martial Arts- combat systems that focus primarily on form and technique that often supersedes practical application.,Martial Science- a combat system based on proven sciences like bio mechanics, anatomy, kinesiology, geometry and physics. Form and technique as well as practical applications are derived from these proven sciences.,I feel like this needs clarification again, as somebody doing MT among other things, form and technique are paramount, but practicality is also..,Maybe we define it differently? You mean forms, such as katas? And technique, as in moves that may/may not play a role in a fight?,These are rough definitions but I think it gets the idea across. Another note I might add is that martial sciences are willing to change to assimilate better proven techniques or theories.,The difference between doing something adherent to the system or doing the most efficient action for the particular situation. Also the motivation for the nature of the technique. Is your martial practice based on tradition or scientific scrutiny?,Mine? Uhm.... probably tradition/other(effectiveness)..,Except that in most case a form is a series of techniques stringed together to teach the artist each individual technique as well as what may lead up to those techniques and what a useful move may be after doing such a technique. Forms are literally just there to teach you how to fight -- EVERY movement has an application. If you encounter someone who knows a kung fu form, karate form, etc. and any one of the movements DOES NOT have a practical application (even if that application is intimidation), they are incorrectly practicing their martial art and are instead merely dancing.,Forms are the nucleus of the system yes, but that's doesnt translate to efficacy. Examples: most animals styles of Kung fu fall short because they imitate animal movements rather than choosing the most effective way that the human body works.,What?,Yes, but that's where fighting style comes from. Sure, there is probably a most technically effective set of fighting moves that can be used. That's not the point. If I want the most effective, I'll buy a gun.,A good martial artist will win most effectively, and save all the 'grace' for when him and his friends are circle jerking each other in their McDojo.,So, a good martial artist will just buy a handgun and carry it with him. Nowadays, guns are common enough to make that realistic. What's the point in even learning a martial art? You're not doing it for the sake of the art, you're not doing it for the sake of pushing your body. You're doing it to win in a life-or-death fight. So buy a gun. It's a lot cheaper than learning a martial art. It's a lot more efficient than learning a martial art.,Or some of us just prefer straighforwardness. I prefer Boxing to other MA's like Muay Thai not because I think Boxing is more effective, but because I like simplicity. I don't want to think about when to kick, knee, elbow along with punching. ,Also, I don't like the fact that some of the traditional martial artists I've call martial arts like Boxing and Muay Thai not actual martial 'arts' because there's nothing 'artsy' about them. ,Also, owning a gun doesn't make you fit, and I'm sure almost everyone who starts learning a Martial Art does it to be fit.,The defense rests.",,"03/29/13(Fri)14:41,03/29/13(Fri)14:44,03/29/13(Fri)14:48,03/29/13(Fri)14:56,03/29/13(Fri)15:00,03/29/13(Fri)15:38,03/29/13(Fri)15:39,03/29/13(Fri)15:47,03/29/13(Fri)15:50,03/29/13(Fri)15:57,03/29/13(Fri)15:57,03/29/13(Fri)15:59,03/29/13(Fri)16:08,03/29/13(Fri)16:12,03/29/13(Fri)16:12,03/29/13(Fri)16:19,03/29/13(Fri)16:23,03/29/13(Fri)16:24,03/29/13(Fri)16:39,03/29/13(Fri)16:48,03/29/13(Fri)17:05,03/30/13(Sat)23:06,04/01/13(Mon)19:34,04/02/13(Tue)02:27,04/02/13(Tue)07:45","Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,MYVT,MYVT,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,MYVT,MYVT,MAI,MAI,MYVT,MYVT,MAI,MAI,MYVT,MYVT,MAI,MAI,MYVT,MYVT,MYVT,MYVT,MAI,MAI,Anonymous,Anonymous,MYVT,MYVT,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"
"Martial artists get in here.,There are so many martial arts out there and I have no idea which to pick. My only experience is a few karate classes when I was a little kid and that's it.,Help?,find out why you want to be a martial artist first then look at what is around you,if you want self defense look for a style that doesnt neglect either the ground/clinching or striking, has a minimum of rules(for reference TKD has way too fucking many, beautiful art, but not for self defense) and gets your sparring within a few months(getting punched in the face is kindof a requirement if you want to talk about how ready you are for a bar fight),if you are looking for something to keep you in shape, find a gym that keeps you active(you are probably looking for an mma styled fitness center for this one, but again; gotta bei n your area),if you are looking to meet people, this is going to be a little harder, go around to different schools and do a class and try to talk to everyone and get a feel for the community,cant think of many other reasons to pick one up,Very good advice, thanks.,Wing chun, Jeet Kune Do,Are you interested in stand-up or grappling, or a mixture? Try a local BJJ class, it will be free, try a few places, see if you like it. Try a couple of boxing clubs, kung fu dojos, muy thai gyms etc, anything you're interested in.,I personally stay away from wing chun flashy kung fu type arts. unless you just want to do that shit for fun, go for it.,MUAY THAI,What are you looking for? For actual combat, anything military, preferably Russian as Americans are now embracing MMA stuff for life or death situations, which will get our soldiers killed. For fitness, boxing, tai chi, kung fu, or mma.,No they're not.,Find something that appeals to you and learn it, it's as simple as that, look into the history, the mentality and the approach of the system, and make your own decision.,For the love of God don't listen to this guy.,Listen to this guy.,Self-defense?,Grappling?,Striking?,A mixture?,Competetive?,Non-competetive?,Weapons?,Hollywood bullshit?,Down-to-Earth and effective?,Tell us your preferences and it would be easier to make recommendations,I'm looking for a form of self-defense, preferably striking, not grappling, and I don't care whether it's competitive or not, or if there are weapons.,if you want self defense then youre gonna need striking and grappling. if you just want standup then find someplace that has good sparring,Judo 5 years.,Boxing 5 years (no sparring, just bag work and focus mitts),This should be every martial artists core. Gives you a good grounding in grappling, ground work, and striking.,After this you will have enough knowledge and experience to make up your own mind about good, bad, and fraudulent martial arts.,I say switch out boxing for thai style MT. Imagine how bad ass someone would be with a judo and muay thai style clinch. Knees and elbows and then a head first slam into the pavement, plus decent scrambling ablities/ striking defense, and groundwork.,Why the fuck wouldn't you spar? It develops actual fighting instincts like timing and it gives you experience with being hit, which is vital.,MT is great, but Judo has limited ground work, especially with all the rules changes it has undergone lately.,during sparring instructors are usually pretty happy to have groundwork sessions go longer. The limitation is only happening in competitions.,Boxing and MT are too dangerous for your health. The amounts of hits you take to the head in sparring is just doing long term damage. I've read a few of the studies and the evidence is too strong to ignore. ,Sparring is great, but it should be done without striking. Judo and BJJ style sparring will give you enough free fight experience without the brain damage.,My club was not nearly as cool about it, bummer. ,I would agree that boxing and muay that are dangerous, yeah, but if you limit sparring to like, once or twice a week it isn't that bad for your long term health. Its just one of the risks that come along with learning striking.,With any martial art you run the risk of short term and long term damage.,You need to weigh the risks with the benefits. ,I've broken and dislocated many bones through my practice of Judo and there are a few issues with my body, but the price was worth it.,My brain on the other hand is too high a cost. I'm probably going to live to 80-90 and no amount of experience I gain from striking sparring is going to make up for a stutter and reduced cognitive functions.,Do you live to fight or fight to live?,I train martial arts for quality of life, self-confidence, and insurance when the shit hits the fan. I don't train to get beaten up or take hits to the head because some idiot can't calm down. ,It's a balancing act, but my health comes first.,If I would have to define any reason for my desire to fight, it is rooted primarily in my views on Zen, but thats a huge digression, not appropriate for this topic. Damage is inevitable in any form of serious martial training (i'm currently recoving from a smashed wrist and jammed ring finger, both on my primary hand), but I trust every one of my sparring and rolling partners, if I didn't I would refuse to practice with them. Sparring isn't done to try and kill each other, so things like black-eyes, broken noses and such should be somewhat uncommon as a result. You dont go 100% every session, instead you just kind of find each other's pace and work from there,Wing Chun is really useful; if not for the techniques, but mostly for the thought process of striking. Could prolly mix this with Muy Thai.,For grapping and takedowns, sambo is really brutal. Judo is good too; both use really similar principles, though I feel sambo standing locks are better. I really like aikido takedowns; but it's pretty hard to find a decent aikido dojo outside of japan.,For pure ground techniques, can't really beat BJJ; unless you're a catch wrestling genius called Sakuraba.,boxing for 5 years and never sparring,dear lord please be trolling me,Martial arts are actually one of the safer sports, if you don't get punched in the head too often.,Never had any injury with Judo myself. And Krav Maga only resulted in weekly bruises.,if you're in a good dojo with highly trained people, you shouldn't get injured too badly. if possible always try to get paired with the highest leveld person, they usually have the best control.,I had a student who did Boxing for 8 years and never sparred.,We did some free for all no rules sparring and he did pretty well.,Grappling sparring is enough. Striking sparring isn't necessary. You can practice on moving targets that aren't human for the same results.,if you do wing chun, sticky hands are a great way to train, without risk of injury (unless your partner is a d-bag),That is completely untrue, that is a static predictable object. A persob is entirely different, the dodge, they slip and they are tryingbto position themselves to open up their own techniques, which they will be hitting you with.,Alright, this is more of a ""what if"" but if I just spent time shadow boxing and fighting pads, without any instruction, would I be able to learn a lot that way, or do you think I'd just look like a douche? ,I've done some boxing, some judo, and when I was young some karate. So I at least know what my form is supposed to look like.,If you want to learn how to fight, you need to fight. There's no way around it. It is going to hurt when you are hit, but it will help you learn, because you will have concrete feedback from both your own body and your opponent. Your partner will know exactly what your problems are, because he is exploiting them.,as long as you're thinking about scenarios and how to work it out. but I've found having a partner is really useful in running scenarios out (i have poor spacial visualization).,As far as shadowboxing is concerned, always keep your elbows tucked, keep punches as compact as possible. Make sure you're involving your legs/body in punches, they're key in generating a lot of power in punches.,I've been in fights, I'm not about to become some aggro-alphadouche just to get some good ""fight experience"" ,If, that's what you're getting at.,At Krav Maga we do this a lot with a knife.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwS1,I'm not sayong you need to around punching people on the street, thats idiotic. I'm saying that if you want to learn striking, it requires fighting against other strikers, with intent. This means finding a gym/dojo/school which supports full-contact sparring, many don't.,the military embraces whatever the latest fad is, this has always been true,Christ, don't ever do that to an eskrimador. He'd use the force of your block to accelerate a j-hook (enganyo) strike into your torso. Or pull the cut short and strike your arm. Batting away a blade like that would be suicidal, against someone that knows how to use a knife. You must control the weapon before you do anything else.,I have a vaguely related question:,I've been in Jujutsu for about 10 years now, (I started in the Bujinkan, you know, ""ninjutsu"", but although I liked the technique I disliked the community) and I'm looking for a close combat art to supplement it. ,I've been in several different schools, and I by far prefer the ones where atemi (striking to set up grappling) is covered in depth. I've even gone out of my way to learn the old striking techniques that came from traditional Jujutsu but aren't widely practiced in most jujutsu schools (kicks, hand strikes, ect, most are very karate-like).,I was thinking Silat would work well as a supplementing art, but I'm not decided. Thoughts?,u could look into systema, its like aikido with real strikes for the atemi :D,Systema does sound appealing. What's your experience with it?,I have experience in Kung Fu, Karate, TKD & BJJ and personally I would say BJJ is by far the most practical, most fun and a better workout.,The only one I would actively avoid was Karate, it may have just been my specific club, but it was totally useless and tedious. I quit because I actually felt I was unlearning shit i'd learned elsewhere.,It depends on what you mean by ""practical"". If I want to win in an empty handed, one on one fight, BJJ is absolutely awesome.,If I am facing someone who might pull a knife the second I tackle them before his friends run over and stomp my face in, BJJ... might not be the best choice.,After getting a shodan rank in Bujinkan I switched to Genbukan, and the training group I run is required to hit harder and have more ferocity in general. At the same time, we go over a lot of things not often visited in the Bujinkan. I personally believe that all of the concepts for fighting are in each organization, but it's tough to find a teacher who trains in a non-compliant way.",What martial art should I choose?,"03/31/13(Sun)22:19,03/31/13(Sun)22:23,03/31/13(Sun)22:26,03/31/13(Sun)22:36,03/31/13(Sun)22:56,03/31/13(Sun)22:57,03/31/13(Sun)23:04,03/31/13(Sun)23:48,04/01/13(Mon)00:24,04/01/13(Mon)00:53,04/01/13(Mon)23:20,04/01/13(Mon)23:24,04/02/13(Tue)01:25,04/02/13(Tue)01:27,04/02/13(Tue)01:32,04/02/13(Tue)01:42,04/02/13(Tue)01:43,04/02/13(Tue)01:49,04/02/13(Tue)02:01,04/02/13(Tue)02:09,04/02/13(Tue)02:18,04/02/13(Tue)02:20,04/02/13(Tue)02:22,04/02/13(Tue)02:25,04/02/13(Tue)02:27,04/02/13(Tue)02:30,04/02/13(Tue)02:30,04/02/13(Tue)02:32,04/02/13(Tue)02:38,04/02/13(Tue)02:39,04/02/13(Tue)02:40,04/02/13(Tue)02:43,04/02/13(Tue)02:45,04/02/13(Tue)03:39,04/02/13(Tue)04:39,04/02/13(Tue)05:19,04/02/13(Tue)06:46,04/02/13(Tue)07:00,04/02/13(Tue)07:38,04/02/13(Tue)07:49,04/02/13(Tue)08:27","Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"
"Parkour General,Photos, stories, videos and anything else related to parkour/free running are all welcome here. If you want to share a video then please check that it isn't on the first few pages of YouTube videos for the term ""parkour"", as we've all seen them already.,http://youtu.be/FaPCHBVDnIU,David Belle interview, talking about why he started parkour and what it means to him and how it's bettered him as a person,http://youtu.be/M2sWvgsEXeU,Hour and a half long documentary on Lisses, France; the birthplace of parkour, and of the origins of parkour itself. Includes footage of over 150 traceurs,http://youtu.be/QH09YCtpKaw,Hour long documentary on parkour following five freerunners from San Diego to the Nevadan desert,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMpp,Be sure to stretch before and after every training session.,Dynamic stretches are generally better than static stretches.,Don't buy shoes with plastic on the soles or artificial support, they'll fall apart and hinder the strengthening of your feet.,Bodyweight training (calisthenics) as well as lifting weights can be excellent supplements to parkour training. Remember not to push yourself too hard--you should always leave some ""in the tank"" to prevent gradual training injury.,Parkour is a DISCIPLINE, stay in control of your body; don't be an idiot. You can, and will get hurt eventually, but that doesn't mean you should take stupid risks: You must walk before you can run.,Don't abuse the locations in which you train. Don't litter or vandalise the local spots. Make a real effort to leave the places you train better than when you got there. We want to show the world that what we do is a good thing.,Bompin' fresh new thread! I took a rest day yesterday when the weather finally stopped being amazing for a while.,I spent half the day today rolling back and forth in bed, too weak to get up. I've been sick with some kind of flu for a day or two now.,Sigh. ;_;,That sucks dude. Feel better. Your favorite spots will still be there when you get back.,Personally, I'm not looking forward to today. Five and a half hours until I have to get up for my 8am class.,I want to die.,Probably a good idea actually.,Hey /pkg/, I'd really like to learn how to parkour, but honestly, I'm out of shape. Any tips on how to best get myself to the point where I could learn to do this kind of stuff?,Overweight or just no muscle?,hey, i've been into bodyweight exercises and parkour training for a little while, love to just go outside and run around. problem is, my favorite pk spots (actually any pk spot near me) is public and where lots of people can see and watch me for any length of time.,is there any way to get over the fear/embarrassment of people watching you train? it's especially annoying because i'm more of a beginner and hate people watching me.,Go out at night.,I would but i'm in college and have limited time to do this stuff, i need to work it in during the day and i need to get sleep. so night/evening training wont work for me unfortunately.,It's pretty hard to get over the fear of being judged, but there's another way to do it.,Go to the public places when they're busy and ask people to show you the ropes. That's the big upside of the parkour culture--people love to help. A thread or two ago there was a most feelsy link wherein a guy with Cerebral Palsy was training in parkour and was just one of the guys, and that sort of thing isn't uncommon.,Trust me on this one, anywhere that people run is a place that you'll be accepted. As long as you're trying, nobody will judge you.,I wonder if it's possible to become a parkour bum.,Like a beach bum, but urban.,Anyone know anything about this?,It's a book about urban survival for hippies. It is outdated but not a bad read.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tXp,What do you guys this of this little video from SoulPancake?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jX,Interesting. I'll have to give that a read.,I'm not really planning to become a bum, but it'd be nice to try and dig into some concepts for avoiding excess spending. If I can get my costs down enough, I could probably live just by my part-time indefinitely.,I'm sick of that excuse. If you really want to parkour, then parkour. You do parkour to get fit.,Fucken Lol. looks so fun,Tricker reporting in, how's everyone?,I'm gonna take a rest day today but I'll do some dynamic stretching later on, I'm pretty fucking sore from an hour long session I had yesterday.,I've been on a break for the past year but I'm getting back into training big time! Bought myself a new camera, made up a new workout routine to get back into shape and I'm currently saving money to hopefully hit up the next big gathering,Threw up my first video yesterday too since I started training, I'm happy with how the video turned out but my tricks need a serious polishing!,http://youtu.be/s6r-Hp1lwco,Overweight, though not so much that I'd be called fat. At least, not by American standards.,bumping this,Anyone got any resource to parkour? I mean, just something to get proper form etc.,Thanks for posting once the last one 404ed OP, I've been at college today so wasn't able to myself.,Anybody else doing anything interesting over Easter? I'm going on a Classics trip with my college to Athens for a week, the itinerary allows me significant amounts of free time so I fully intend to fit some parkour training in that unfamiliar location, really looking forward to it.,Oh, I was also banned last night.,If you're fat you should begin by getting rid of the fat. You can't properly perform parkour if you have a bad strength to weight ratio,Ha! Brilliant ending there.,You could benefit from a lot more flexibility, so definitely get serious about stretching.,Ah this thread wasn't lost lol ,Indeed a lot of stretching is needed, just finished up soem dynamic stretching there about 10mins ago, glad you liked the ending haha,3 unjustifiably elitist 5 me,I've been doing parkour since October 2010. I live in New Mexico so there's not many places that I can go to do parkour. so I mostly run to keep my stamina up and do wallruns whenever I see a good wall. Here's one of my fav vids that I took with my GoPro at the University of New Mexico. What do you guys think,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NncO,It is a great spot but it's quite a drive from home. The guys that taught me parkour trained there but they opened up a parkour gym. It's a good gym but I don't get the same workout I got when training at the college.,lolwut,I had been hawk-eyeing it for hours because I'd already drawn up the new OP picture. I hope everyone likes it.,It's called Zero Point Parkour,So what? Lots of people starting need to go somewhere to learn the basics and there are people willing to teach them for money and a gym is a good environment to learn it when you are starting (mat on floor cushion your mistakes),That's the worst possible way to start out training, trust me..,Besides, we have a giant rock with a circumference of 40,075 km to train on that's FILLED with everything one would need to train AND train safely AND train for free.,It's filled with oil and rocks and shit. It's what's on the surface that matters.,Say, you copy/pasted this from some APK thread, if my memory serves me right.,So, what music do you listen to while doing parkour? ,I personally like Bonobo and Cat Empire, and some random 80s pop thrown in for good measure.,underground hiphop, mostly jedi mind tricks and so forth,Raver's fantasy - manian,promises - nero (skrillex remix),drop - east clubbers,Those are my main 3. I try to keep it fast paced stuff,Earbuds keep falling out and the last thing I want is getting stuck on something with the cord.,I have bluetooth headphones, myself.,Now if only I actually had some kind of portable media device. Anyone know of one that's functional and cheap enough for us poorfags?,Also, I can't help it. I'm all about Jshit music.,It's all I ever use. I highly recommend it!,Sansa Clip. /g/ approved and /fa/ as fuck.,has anyone ever died doing parkour?,people have died getting out of the shower. So yeah most likely.,Yes, though apparently parkour has a very low mortality rate compared to most extreme sports.,Also ,Maybe some cases, but they are very rare. The only person I can think of that has died doing ""Parkour"" was a young girl from Russia who had no idea what she was doing and tried to jump a roof gap with an 8 story drop. She didn't make it and fell to her death., You don't sound that fat so I would say just start running around, and climb everything. Tree branches are usually easier to hold on to than brick walls. Don't worry about form yet, you can pull yourself up with your stomach like you would get out of the pool. Focus on becoming more agile and building a strength base and the movement alone should help you shed a small amount of weight. You should also go ahead and start working on landings and rolls., Parkour is about teaching yourself not to die while doing parkour. As you grow comfortable with your body the stunts that look scary to other people become less dangerous for you. It's like learning how to drive, it's safer once you know what to expect.,DONT FUCKING RISK YOUR SELF,I had one of those, and I loved it save for one thing--it's battery life just wasn't long enough. It only lasted about two continuous hours.,It eventually died on me, though, and I haven't had a player since.,Doesn't that require apple software and stuff, though? I don't want to use itunes.,Only part I'll disagree with,Can't possibly agree any harder. This is the single most important thing about training parkour/freerunning. You're going to want to try to push yourself harder and harder, but you need to take a second and really think before committing to anything remotely dangerous.,Believe me, I've fucked up enough times in the past.,Yeah, nah, you're doing it wrong.,True dedication comes from training harder every day.,If you want to go without risking yourself, it's easy. Plenty of sleep, ample nutrition, and little to no drugs or alcohol... and definitely nothing harder than weed or caffeine on the drug side of things. Anything more than that and you're taking great unnecessary risks with body chemistry that, let's face it, none of us understand much if at all.,At the very least, the relative prevalence of drug deaths is a decent reason to avoid them.,On the other hand, I do agree with the partying hard part, though... at least insofar as fun is important to healthy living.,The general concept of leaving something ""in the tank"" is good in all training, really. I mentioned it in the second post, but maybe another line should be added... something to the tune of ""don't take a jump you can't afford to fail unless your life is at risk."",Picture tangentially related, sort of, I guess.,How do I develop air sense?,I just started doing parkour. I'm a track dude, and I'm in good shape. Speed's my thing, but I've always wanted to learn how to do flips and navigate obstacles quickly. In the little time that I have been doing parkour, I've found that I excel in climbing and scaling surfaces, but I would like to gain skill in traversing things. I can't Tic-Tac, but I can run up/step off walls in order to climb things. I can climb surfaces, but I can't Kong or Vault. There has to be a way.,Can someone help me get on the right track?Pun not intended.,If you want to learn something GO DRILL IT and practice it. Type in ""Kong vault tutorial"" on youtube you dingus. It takes time and dedication.,Don't listen to this crap, most of us just woke up one day and were perfect. I'm part ninja on my mother's side so it's even easier for me. My best friend can only do parkour because he was part of a government experiment gone wrong.,Yeah I hear ya. My friend Des came from a long line of assassins, and he can do shit just because he lied down for a few days next to a computer.,I'm a Namekian, so I SHOULD be able to get it though.,got back from the San Diego Jam on saturday, looking for the video that a friend made. ill post it when i find it.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLdD,Nice trips bro,Though I still remember reading this somewhere.,Maybe Reddit in r/parkour. I've brought this point up there as well.,This had better be a recurring gag.,Sup /pkg/,I'm trying to do a backward leap through time, but I can't seem to get enough height even after starting off that big tower in Dubai.,Does anyone have any tips?,Buy better shoes.,What I usually do is wear a beanie which helps keeps the earbuds actually IN my ears and I feed the cord under my tshirt down my back and leave the music player sit in my back pocket, works well enough,For fucks sake..,this is what it felt like at the last pk jam i went to. everyone was doing wallflips and i decided to snag the bottom of a fire escape and dyno up to the actual platform. all the trickers tried to heckle me ""good luck getting down"",So it's a poor choice of terminology.,I never understood people who want to turn everything into cultish doctrine...,Just move. Do it your way, with the goals you have in mind.,I did not film it,thankyou,So guys, there's this fat kid at my school. He wears Nike Frees, and almost every time I see him he just does a little jump and yells ""HARDCORE PARKOUR"" and every time someone asks him what that means he says, ""It's like, jumping off stuff."",wat do?,Umm...ignore him?,The way you described it makes it sound like he has a legit mental disorder.,just ignore him,Can't make the whole world your problem. It's not healthy. Ignore it. Not your business anyway.,You're right guys, I'll just ignore him.,Not sure if this will help anyone, but I thought I'd share.,I do parkour, and a lot of urban-exploration. They seem to feed off of each other.,Regardless, I've found a wonderful little trick. If you have shoes with those fucking awful plastic shit on the bottom, especially right under your bridge, I've started covering it with one or two layers of medical taps, just to slightly increase traction, and keep from slipping while I balence, or precision on a bar.,Thoughts?,Yeah but only if you're stupid. Some guys in Russia were teaching some girls and they jumped from one roof to another. One of the girls tried it and failed falling and dying.,I've injured myself. Mostly rolled ankles and hit my feet pretty hard. The most serious injury was when I went to get on a roof and there was a nail sticking out. Cut my hand open and I had to get stitches.,who cares? it's free and you basically only need it to update your stuff,tell him to run across a wall,Well it's a waste of money to be putting that stuff on your shoes. I use the merell barefoot. They're great and my last pair lasted me almost 2 years,I only do it like that, because I basically only ever have two pair of shoes, and the other pair are dress shoes,I just don't want to install a whole new program to do something my computer can already do.,Plastic shit on the bottom of shoes impedes the strengthening of lower leg muscles and ligaments and tendons around the ankle and along the foot while training, you'd be best getting Feiyues or some other kind of shoe without it, although if money is stupidly tight (unlikely, as Feiyues are like $20 a pop) then your MacGyvering is quite cool,MahNigga.jpg,I just got a pair of Merrell road gloves for 60. They feel freaking great!,i'm going to paris tomorrow, in the heart of parkour,anyone knows good places to run?,on everything. ,climb the Eiffel Tower, no stairs or ladders allowed, post pics.,What would you recommend practising to someone who has never done parkour, but runs a lot and does bodyweight training?,flexibility training, balance training, lrn2roll, climb walls, jump over things,Thanks man.,Bout to start a shitstorm on this thread:,How much of your time do you dedicate to conditioning as a traceur? Be honest.,Personally, I'd love to say 60%. But, being honest...about 10-15%. I'm working on improving that ratio, because I understand that training takes its toll on the body without training the underlying muscle tissue as well.,Thus, may I suggest that in tips and tricks we add a section for conditioning exercises, especially for beginners?,I'm a traceur of about three years, and during that time I'm lucky enough to have gone to London, and for two amazing/miserable days, I trained at Rendezvous 2012 with the Parkour Generations team, as well as one of the Yamakasi, Williams Belle. As per the international standards of things concerning parkour ranked by order of awesomeness, the training was awesome, the conditioning sucked. And there was A LOT of conditioning.,Here's just some of the stuff we did:,About a billion pushups,About a million crunches,Miles of QM, from standard to spiderman (really low to the ground the whole time) to inchworms (start in QM, push hands out as far as possible, slowly move feet forward until you're basically doing a toe-touch stretch, then start moving hands forward again), forward monkey walks (knuckle walking), side monkey walks, and duck walks.,Hanging from a wall for a set amount of time before traversing it,Holding pushup position while others in a team of 8-10 did a specific PK move ten times with perfect form (only break was when you were up to perform the move),Half a million squats on the toes,Holding chair position against a wall,Pistols (one legged squats, pushed through the heel, not the toes, while the other leg remains forward for balance,Sprints,Jogging,Burpees,Jumping jacks,One armed pushups,I'm sure there were more, but I've forgotten what all we did.,Needless to say though, it was INTENSE. But, as per PKG motto, we were there to train ""to be and to last."",Thoughts?,Bamp.,Fuck professional wrestling. :D,What's the best way to stop being a little bitch & start jumping gaps more than 3 & 1/2 feet wide? For some reason I can't push myself to. ,So like I said, what's the easiest way to get over this gutlessness? Just keep pushing yourself, or start of small & jump over high heights?,Both. Fear is natural, and overcoming it is just part of the process of training PK. During the course of your training, however, you'll naturaly develop the ability to overcome more and more fear as your confidence increases.,There are also several methods of increasing your confidence when facing a big jump by practicing on the ground to show yourself you're capable of jumping that far, and then finding ways to make the ground jump involve other obstacles, say a stair, adding difficulty little by little until you're confident enough to try the jump you're afraid of.,Any advice on catwalking and precision jumps?,Trained them today, but falling seemed like it was almost inevitable. :L,yeah, the whole doing it on the ground to see that you can is a good idea.,also, look up cat leaps or something like that.,basically, swing your arms forward when jumping in order to give yourself more forward momentum.,for landing precisions, squat deeply upon landing.,lowering your center of gravity like that makes it easier to stop.,Catwalking, especially on rails, is one of those skills you have to train by simply holding on like fuck. As you train them, your balance will improve, making it easier to stay on the rail. Until then, if you fall off, just simply hold on tighter next time and keep training.,I find that letting your legs go a little below the rail can also help if you're starting to tip over the other side.,To clarify, if you're tipping to the right, bring your left leg off the rail and let it dip underneath the rail to counterbalance your body, and vice-versa.,You can and should do much better than that. ,I have been training close to 7 years now (I'm 19). I keep a journal of my conditioning and strengthening.,Pic related, my page from today., I try to condition and work on flexibility for 2 hours every day, however, do not assume you can increase in skill by only training flexibility and strength. Keep in mind that the best way to get better at jumping is by going out and jumping all the time. Same with flips, vaults, etc. ,A powerful athlete is not a strong athlete. A powerful athlete is someone who can exert his strength quickly and efficiently. ,Training for the coordination and skill needed for parkour is purely a matter of forming proper connections in the nervous system through practice (Technique). Each time you preform a movement in parkour it causes the connections involved with that movement to strengthen in your brain and makes the next performance easier, more certain to the practitioner, and more readily done at a moments notice. Likewise, disuse tends to weaken any pathways that have been formed and makes doing them an act more difficult and uncertain. ,Thus we can only attain the skill we are looking for by performing the thing we are trying to learn. In order to make sure that the movements are the most efficient use of energy and motion, one must condition his muscles and stay flexible, that way the most efficient method for the movement can be performed without injury or restriction because of tight muscles and tendons.,I like your conditioning routine, as a personal trainer It's nice to see people training properly for their sport.,Keep up the good work man, you have a good mindset to be aware of your body and its need for proper conditioning.,Have you guys run into this image yet?,Do parkour.,I do have a thought. As a /fit/izen first, I'm sighing at most of that work. You may feel tired, but it isn't actually helpful for building new muscle. ,Though you seem pretty legit, I am not crazy about their conditioning drills.,Most of parkour is endurance. I do however also prefer a more strength-focused routine. Squats and chin-ups are what I would recommend most for parkour.,I knew Christopher Hollingsworth was on 4chan.,Well, there was supposedly that one guy they featured on ""1000 Ways to Die"", but other than that, of course people have died. But if they did, they died doing something they weren't ready for.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEOh,Traceur from McMaster University, Ontario here. Been doing it for 6 years, but my progress has been a little slow lately, I think because I just don't get out to train enough and I don't spend any time in the gym, so I have nowhere to safely attempt riskier new techniques. Honestly, I'm a jack of all trades and a better teacher than a traceur.,Any other Canadafags here?,Pic related, reverse vault out of running precision (caption courtesy of my gf),is there like, a limit age, to start pk? or maybe a recommended age?,soon as you can run and climb,Thanks guys, I appreciate it.,Not here, but yes.,It's a surprisingly accurate portrayal.,Make him roll. Then laugh at him as he rolls his rolls.,I can't roll.,I have a godlike vertical leap, can do a multitude of vaults and can gain like double height tic-tacing, but I can't roll.,Does that mean I'm not a real parkourist?,Cause if it does fuck parkour.,No, it just means you can't roll and as such you are missing one of the (if not the most) fundamental techniques. Without the ability to roll you narrow the scope of your practice as well as risk damage to your body.,Rolling safely and comfortably on concrete is one of the hardest things to learn. It's such a personal thing as everyone has different body mechanics, different boney parts to knock etc.,Start practicing!,Goal isn't to build new muscle, though, you see? Only to make iron those already existing. We tend to let new movements in PK build new muscle.,Watch this.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RXC,This:,Your roll will come with time, but you have to learn, and practice it nearly every day before it becomes a natural movement, and doesn't cause friction between you and the ground.,You'll start off smashing your acromion process into the ground, squishing the muscles along your scapula, finding rocks in the thin skin along your spine, and developing big knots on your iliac spine. But one day, after ten thousand rolls, you'll do one, and it'll feel right. It'll be smooth as butter.,And then you'll know how to roll from standing.,From then, it's practicing height drops to roll. :D,I see your gasworks vid, and raise you another.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?featur,I used to go to parks and the subway just for kicks. The parks in NYC are great for training.,r u avin a gigle m8,This thread was on page two. bringin it back.,Fuck, I expected /asp/ to be about something besides /asp/bergery wrasslin. Like,if you like wrestling, that's fine.,But every fucking thread on /asp/ergers is wrestling. Not even fucking luchadore shit, it's all that fucking soap opera with a side of testosterone bullshit. Fuck.,The only people I've seen curse that much in a post are all wrestling fans. ,Dunno what your problem is or why you had to bring it into the parkour thread and then accuse others of having aspergers.,I swear a lot. I just do. One of my fields of study is psychology, so when I see ""asp"" i just default to ""aspergers"" immediately from having seen it so many times. I'm not accusing anyone of having aspergers, I just think its gonna be funny when they start calling this board this.,That's what I thought too mate. Hahaha. Let's call this board's denizens /asp/ergians!,Or since it's fitness related and we're all trying to become better by being here we could call each other /asp/irers.,How can we begin Parkour ?,Step 1 Get a skateboard,Step 2 backflip off skateboard and land back on it,Step 3 Profit,Parkour with a skateboard ?,I know enough on Parkour that you don't do it with a skateboard. Maybe you can do tricks but it's not Parkour,looks like 'take off shirt' is actually Step 1,Most people go wrong at step 1 and put shirt one. Just don't put it on and you won't have to take it off,You know the more I lurk on the internet the more I think there's a bunch of us that do parkour here in Albuquerque there's just not really much of an effort for an organized scene.,For instance I had no idea that gym you talk about even existed. I've always just trained in the University area, downtown, and nature stuff up in the foothills. Where's the gym, does it have a name/website?,Yeah, but a skateboard is about the width of the smallest thing you can safely land on, and is also not multiple stories up in the air.,/pkg/, you guys are the only ones who would understand this, I think.,That feel when finally able to start rolls on concrete again after a painful shoulder injury. When you stop being able to roll, a lot of your parkour world shuts down. I've been going to jams left handed and in a sling, it fucking sucked.,Moral of the story, don't put your elbows out behind you when you bail a double kong in a gym. The spring floor that is all too easy to get used to, to become careess with your technique, will bite back.,I know that feel.,I'm glad that you are getting back into the swing of things! Injuries really set you back mentally and physically. Keep up the good attitude and you'll bounce back into your usual routine stronger and more confident than ever.,Dame Du Lac in Lisses,A good tip to avoid hitting your hip: keep your head tucked when your shoulder contacts the ground, then turn your head to look forward mid-roll,works every time,I don't suppose anyone knows anything about a New England scene?,I can't find a single person here in Massachusetts. There are some university clubs, but they're all on the other side of the state, which might as well be the moon, considering.,I just want a friend to train with... In all the videos you see people cheering each other on, doing funny things and joking around...,Training alone is no fun.,Total noob here, what do you guys think about Tempest Freerunning? I want to get into this whole parkour nonsense, and I saw a video with one of their classes in it, and it looked pretty informative. Should I take a trip to LA to check it out or what?,What do you guys think of my shoe? I'm just starting out and I have very bad knees and ankles from playing rugby when I was younger so i want a bit of support and shock absorption for when I land as my knees are bad.,oops, forgot photo,these are my current shoes,plastic crap/10,If your knees are bad, start barefoot and take it really slow while they improve.,Look up Convict Conditioning and Convict Conditioning 2 on The Pirate Bay. The second one, especially, is a great guide to un-fucking the most fucked joints. If it's anything less than a full joint replacement, it'll help. I fixed my bad knees and back that way.,cheers for the help man, downloading those now.,No, it just means you're going to injure yourself.,Hey /pkg/, check out this move.,I call it... the bumpstand.,so /asp/, i have really bad shins, not the joints, the shins themselves. It feels like they are bruised but i can't see any bruises. I can only feel the pain while doing high impact sports and parkour is the worst. Anyone know what i could do to help this?,That's called ""Shin splints"",It's basically a type of strain injury, you can look it up on your own. The way to fix it is simple: Stop. Stop everything. Walk as little as possible, stretch constantly by gently moving your ankle in progressively larger and larger circles until it feels loose.,Give it like a week and a half, then start back up slow. Like power-walking slow. Gradually work your way up from there for a week or so, and you should be back to 90% or so.,Train the strength and flexibility of your ankles more, practice dynamic stretching and don't stiffen your ankle on landings--which a remarkable amount of otherwise highly skilled people do.,Splints are a bitch because the only way to make it better is to go low-impact for an extended time, but it'll be worth it.,A simple trick you can use to strengthen up the tissues there is to just get in the habit of standing on your toes now and again in your day to day.,Good luck, bro.,thanks for the help, its gonna be a bitch to do but i'll manage.,It really sucks, man, and I feel for you.,On the plus side, while that's going on is a great time to work on upper-body strength moves, since they put very little strain on your legs in general. If you put an object under your legs, just above your ankles, you can do push ups all day without re-straining your splint injury at all. Bonus points, it makes the push-ups harder, so it's good if you're already strong in upper-body pressing muscles. I like a basketball for that one, but if you don't have one handy almost anything will work.,If you're not strong enough for that yet, you can also just do half push-ups from the knee. If those are too easy for you--like, you could do a hundred and not even feel a strain easy--here's an improvement: Alternate between slow and fast. Start high. Go down slowly, should take about a second and a half, two seconds. Then go up, same amount of time. Go down slowly again, then explode upward, full-power, get as much height as you can without using your spine. Catch yourself on the way down and slow gradually. By the time you're near the ground, you should be moving as slow as you were on the slow rep.,Go back and forth on those for a few sets and your arms will be jelly, especially your shoulders and elbows.,Another one that's good training when you're injured, if you can't properly practice full muscle-ups, is the good old-fashioned pull-up. I'd actually recommend doing an incline pull, though, since it applies to parkour and free running more directly in my opinion. This is simple--get under something like a desk or table and grab the edge, keeping your heels on the ground and your entire body straight. Pull up nice and slow, then back nice and slow. Sounds really easy, but it's great for your spine. I like this one for parkour because it's more of an endurance exercise for the spinal muscles and will do wonderful things for posture, which improves... just about everything, but most of all helps improve your running stride.,A girl who tries is so attractive.,I'm someone different, but after reading through the push up and squat sections, that books seems to be almost exactly the same as this infographic.,Saved. ,/pkg/, do you swear I will love feyues? I have resisted for so long because I just don't trust this whole ""less support is always better"" philosophy, but I am a poorfag so I am running out of other options. My ankles get a feeling of burning very easily if I land wrong so I need good shoes!,I prefer the CC cheat sheet myself, since I like the progressions of it more than any source I've ever seen.,I highly recommend reading through both books all the way, though. Even if it's not a type of training that you normally like, you'll find something in there to improve what you do.,Best guide to strength, I swear.,In hindsight, I probably should also post it. Would help.,Most of my exposure to Feiyue shoes comes from my wushu days when they were the new big thing that China was trying to sell everybody on. They haven't really changed much from then though.,They are light, flexible, and cheap which are all good things. The grip is average to good on most surfaces, but rock/concrete WILL destroy them and quickly. I'd say their good for indoor training/acrobatics and maybe rail stuff but I don't know that I would make them my primary training shoe.,Lots of people swear by them though. Just my two cents.,Hey, guys, are Vans any good for parkour? They have a nice grip.,As long as you have them on and they look like sneakers.,But really, they are bad - don't use them. No support or anything.,Take Judo lessons.,Strengthen the knee joint. Do squats, all the way down, none of these wussy half squats. People call them olympic or high bar squats. They build the muscles above, below and around the knee providing support and strength to the joint and allowing your body to handle and absorb shocks.,About that convict conditioning thing... yeah, it's not that great.,actually vans have way more support than you actually should have for parkour. 2 thick 5 me,just start, rolls are a good thing to learn first and you can practice them almost anywhere,Really depends on the shoe. Vans makes more than one type of shoe, you know. From minimal canvas and rubber to retardedly complicated high-tech skate shoes. I used to train in one of the simpler skate shoes (Rowley Slims, if I remember correctly), and they were fantastic. Nothing fancy, but super durable and great grip.,Hey guys, to keep things short and sweet,,I've really wanted to start practicing free running, unfortunately I'm from a small town in the midwest meaning very little things to practice around. Just wanted to ask some tips for things I should be able to practice.,I'm wanting to use this as a cool thing to do and be able to bring my endurance up and get into better shape. I will be moving to Omaha, NE this fall for schooling there and hope to learn as much as possible this summer before I have more opportunities to hurt myself from lack of experience. Any tips are appreciated! Thanks,Saved, thanks,HOW THE FUCK DO I BREAK MY FALL. I AM SUCH A PUSSY IT ALWAYS HURTS AND I CAN NEVER START WITH MY SHOULDER AREA,jesus fuck lrn2roll before jumping off things holy shit,I FUCKING TRY AND I TRY BUT NEVER SUCCEED,What he actually meant is... literally, learn to roll before you jump off of things.,You start by learning to roll from the ground.,Try it crouching first, then progress to standing up. THEN you try it with a small forward hop, and work your way up SLOWLY.,Don't let videos of experts make you think that's how you start. It's a process of continuing growth. Nobody starts as an expert, so don't get discouraged... and don't hurt yourself being reckless, man, christ., They do have the right grip, but they are too heavy and clumsy.,*Unless those videos are tutorials. There are some excellent tutorials for learning how to roll.,From a muscle standpoint, I can do those fine. However, when I start to go up from the very bottom, I can hear a small amount of ""gristle"" in both my knees. Should I start smaller? Half squats are fine.,Slightly shameful bump.,Start with bodyweight squats. Again, Convict Conditioning is a great book.,Personally, I'm of the opinion that lifting is something you have to work up towards. If your joints aren't already healthy and conditioned properly, lifting loads them poorly, which gives you joint damage while you get good muscle... which is actually worse than just being weak across the board.,The squat progression in CC will get you from easymode supported squats--which you'll want to start with if you have knee damage, which is what that sound is you mentioned, connective tissue damage--all the way up through one-leg bodyweight squats.,When you can lift your whole bodyweight on one leg no problem, your legs will be strong enough to start lifting your weight, plus a bar, without hurting yourself.,Remember, just because you can do it doesn't automatically mean it's a good idea. Some of the worst training injuries are really slow build-ups to a big blowout. Treat conditioning for strength like a martial art: Start with your body first. Until you've got your body mastered, you're not ready for a weapon. The same applies to weights.,Well sure, and a very long time before that, too.,Iused to do parkour like years ago when i was a kid but ive just rekindled my interest. A few questions:,Where should I train?,I dont fancy training in public places just yet, id rather train for confidence first. I was thinking a gymnastics gym?,Whats new in the parkour world?,What the fuck happened to urban freeflow?,In all strength training, it's a good idea to use the simplest motions and lightest amount of weight for as long as possible. More difficulty doesn't automatically mean more gains. If you push harder than your body can handle rebuilding, you may be able to do it... but you'll get shit gains because your body will be too busy fixing the excessive damage. That's why you leave stuff ""in the tank"" when you train--never tire yourself out 100%. You should only do 50% on average, and always leave at least 25% on your hardest training days. Should feel refreshed, not drained. The idea that working yourself to total exhaustion is good training is stupid and always has been.,Anyway, adding weight to any motion is a surprisingly large toll on your joints, physiologically speaking. It's really something you should build up to over time, and not something to start with. There's a reason most power lifters have blown out shoulders and knees, y'know--they start lifting and they try to train up too fast. They don't start with bodyweight to train small muscle groups and connective tissues, and going into larger and larger weights too fast causes huge amounts of strain on the same.,You will be lifting 2x your bodyweight on a barbell with correct form way before you can do a one legged bodyweight squat. ,Do you realize that power lifters are professional athletes that even if they got other jobs on the side they try to win competitions for money, right? ,What happens when someone enter in top level competitions and try to win? Fucked up body parts. ,All volleyball players have fucked up knees, all tenis players have fucked up elbows, etc.,Hitting up an open gym to train some tumbling. Any other bros training today?,That's exactly my point.,You CAN do that, but that does not mean you SHOULD.,It'll cause progressive damage, no matter how good your form is. Form is simply not a replacement for good, gradual conditioning.,Small muscle groups and connective tissues take a lot of time to adapt compared to skeletal muscle. If you load that kind of weight on early, you'll get plenty of muscle for a little while... a few years or so. Then something will blow out and you'll be crippled forever.,You can't write off catastrophic, limb-destroying injuries as something that just happens. The whole point of conditioning is to prevent injury, so you should always start with good calisthenic form. It provides a more systemic basis than starting with weight, anyway.,It's worth the time to train up slowly.,They're called cat passes and arm jumps... fuck.,I'd just like to interject that I could do one-legged BW squats way before I could dl or squat 2x BW, and it seems to me that this would be the case with most people.,The issue isn't whether you can. The issue is whether you can without fucking up your knees.,This, basically.,All it proves is that , is the kind of guy who listens to his body when it says ""This isn't a good idea."",Good on you, anon, for training smart.,I'm still training up, and it's slow going for medical reasons, but I'll be catching up to you some day.,We will have to have a squat-off.,its multiple names for the same thing, i say cat grabs and kong vaults,one thing I have seen wreck people is the stuff they land on falling apart,you can wander around to check somethings,but only the obviously unstable will be provoked,where it is easy to check for a loose rail or wobbly fence just by pushing or standing,brick or stone walls not already broken will only fail under high load,no way to check for this,you will only know when it is too late,some guys wear a small backpack,and keep a battery pack in there wit 5 volt supply,and a small speaker,I don't like to carry things when I'm moving around, unless I need it immediately.,I'd probably go mad carrying around a speaker.,Plus, running around is embarrassing enough without everyone being able to hear my Japanese music.,I still don't understand people who do parkour but nothing freerun related, isn't it boring that the only progress you see is that you can make bigger jumps. Doing harder flips gives so much more satisfaction to me.,Looking for some guidance with shoes.,I've got two things going against me, the first is that I live in Australia, most of the brands of shoe's I've heard recommended in this thread so far aren't available here.,This mean's I'm forced to import, not such an issue but I can't try them to make sure they fit properly, that and feiyue's cost between $50-$80 bucks here.,My bigger issue is my feet... They're 13inches long and rather wide, It's a bitch getting shoes here as is, but the majority of brands that make suitable free running shoes don't make them in my size.,Are there any decent brands that are made in my size that I can import or maybe even find here in Australia?,Thanks in advance for the advice.,99% there is no issues unless there is pain associated with this. There are lots of moving parts in your joints and that noise is normal. If you are really worried, go to a sports physio specialist. Regular physio or doctor would have no idea - they tend to be afraid of physical activity for some reason.,If there is some pain associated with it, you should make an effort to learn proper stretching and foam rolling. IT (Iliotibial band) band is often tight, and can cause the knee cap (Patella) to track improperly (misalign).,Half squats are a waste of time,For Parkour a high vertical is key, Olympic style Weightlifting has been shown to produce athletes with great verticals, and great acceleration. Take a look at the image, Shane Hamman is a fat fuck, but probably has a higher vertical than anyone that commented on this thread.,You are clearly not strong. using the lightest weight for as long as possible will result in minimal progression,Now you're being totally retarded,Look under the section ""Injury Potential of Weight Training"",http://www.exrx.net/WeightTraining/,Your retardation level continues.,Best way to build useful muscles is simply by training whatver the fuck sport you're doing. It's more natural and works well and is more fun to do.,That's why no pro athlete ever does weight training. No NFL football athlete, no NBA basketball athlete, no Olympic level gymnast, no swimmers, no rowers, no speed skaters, no cyclists, none. No athlete lifts weights at the top level other than weight lifters.,/sarcasm, It all depends on your goal. A lot of people like the speed aspect, and flips get in the way of that.,There is no pain associated with it, no.,However, what you said about the knee cap misaligning. I generally roll over my right shoulder, so my left leg is the one that is closer to me coming out of a roll. For low-impact rolls, I never had any problems. However, I did a roll coming off of a tall fence, and my left knee popped in and out, with some pain. My knee felt weak for awhile, and I tried to stay off of it. Similar, but less intense, pops occurred during some roll attempts in the following days, so I decided to take it easy. By that point, though, sometimes when I would kneel down it would pop a little bit. I took it very easy on that knee (no over-compression, that is) for about a month. Now it's fine, but it still feels slightly weaker. ,Also, I should mention, I'm 17, 6'1"", and 150lbs. This isn't an issue coming from being overweight, or old. ,Anyway. back on topic. Should I see a doctor? Now the knee is considerably better, and I've started doing some of the convict conditioning exercises to try and strengthen it, but I'm still a little worried. Thanks for the help.,For me, I enjoy the practical side of parkour. Being able to do something useful. It gives me a skill that I could some day use, you know? ,I understand the freerunning aspect of it, but it just doesn't appeal to me.

"So what does /asp/ think about Karate?,I've seen it mentioned in a few threads but it doesn't seem to get mentioned much here on /asp/, so I was just wondering what the rest of you guys think about Karate as a martial art? I currently practice Shotokan Karate so admittedly my opinion would be a little bit biased.,i practice kenpo and i find it to be fun and different from plain boxing or kick boxing,As a boxer and wrestler, I never was much into karate. It always seemed like too much of a phalanx art. I prefer to bob and weave, then mob in while they're off balance.,legit full contact karate is bad ass but sadly rare and its shitty for all the scam artist to be raping karate's good name. They have some crazy body blows and are legit bad asses. Look at Machida.,Karate is only good if you get full contact experience. Aside from that, it's only really effective in competition. Andy Hug and a few of the other K1 guys are probably the best example of how karate can be used effectively outside of its own context.,one must not forget machida is a 3rd degree blackbelt and has been doing it for at least a decade,what ufc fighter hasnt fought at least 10 years?,many people here seem to be under the impression that karate is limited to people standing in front of a mirror doing kata, shadow boxing, and practicing choreographed combinations.,This likely stems from them getting scammed when they were 5 years old by the place that opened up in the mall, they take that experience and assume all teachers share that training style.,some even go so far as to say if you don""t do nothing but kata then you aren't actually training karate, these are generally the MMA master style!!!!! pride themselves on boasting ignorance and acting like tough blowhards.,If you do nothing but kata, you aren't learning how to fight, you are learning the form. Form instructs you on the 'proper' way to perform a technique, not on the realities of trying to perform a technique on a resisting opponent. That is what sparring is for, it teaches you how people are going to react, what you need to do to enable your techniques and it develops your timing and instincts. Karate isn't BS or anything, its just not taught very effectively in most styles (outside of Kyokushin).,I practiced Wado Ryu for 9 years and Shotokan for about a year and a half.,It's very useful if you get to practice kumite and general sparring since there are a lot grappling techniques and other stuff than kicks and punches, but if you only get to do katas then (as it's already been said) it's completely worthless.,which had nothing to do with the generalization at the end of it,People hate on Karate because of Kata but they are forgetting, or don't know, about Bunkai. This is where each Kata's tecnique is analyzed with sparring partners, highlighting the effectiveness of the moves. They cover very many possible situations. Then you add to this Kumite and all in all it's good training. ,I myself did it for many years right up until a week before my 2nd Dan test, but I got injured. After some introspection, I moved on to Muay Thai which is what I continue to do now. I feel like the Karate however prepared me very well for where I am now, physically and mentally.,Shotokan is rarely good; can be so if you have a legit teacher who does full contact sparring and stuff.,Kyokushin is where its at. ,Generally Shotokan fighters are bad but there are a few great one (like machida), but Kyokushin fighters are always at least pretty good.,Forms aren't needless, otherwise you won't understand the way to perform the technique. I just wish that more dojos would teach in the old ways, not in a manner that is designed simply to get as manyvpeople through the doors I had a similar look at myself with Judo.,as long as they are fighting people that have trouble defending body shots, since they don't punch the head.,you ever watch them fight? it's flat out silly, they just whale on each other until the match is over,I just want to know, what got you guys into Karate? I'm sure I'm gonna sound like a faggot, but the reason I started Boxing is because of Hajime no Ippo, and I'm curious as to what got others into martial arts.,Far, far too many martial arts movies and initially a desire to be badass. It wasn't karate, but still.,I wanted to learn how to kickbox because I passed by a kickboxing gym and it seemed like fun,my teacher was a flake and kind of shitty so after I learned the basics I went to a different place which was closer to my house,the owner of said place was 60 years old and a 7th dan karateka that took on students here and there, he was watching me sparring with one of his students who was a trainer there and afterwards he offered to start teaching me..and the rest is history.,he did not run a formal karate school, he ran a gym and we would meet after hours to train. He had very few students and he said he picked people that he knew would pass the knowledge and training forward to others in the future.,which I do,I watched my dad practice at his club when I was about 4. ,I started when I was about 10, but I had already spent a couple of years on Judo at that point. The Judo club was over an hour away and we didn't have a lot of members (only me and my mother's coworker's son except for 2 blackbelts and the instructor) so I eventually quit and focused more on Karate.,It would get you killed in a real fight, IMO.,go on,Nice quads, but I'd like to hear the theory behind your opinion. Captcha: imply ingamont,all that fancy shit would get you stabbed or shot by some random bath salt nigger.,Try a crane kick? SHANKED,Try a BS kata? CRACK there goes your jaw by an untrained haymaker.,Teaching yourself skills makes you weaker to any unskilled thug.,In a real fight, people don't nicely wait for you to do your jump kicks and wacky hand maneuvers. It very quickly devolves into wailing on each other, groin hitting, eye gouging, and tackling.,You obviously haven't been in a Karate class. Crane kick? I practice Shotokan and never ever done that shit.,And actually using a Kata in a fight? You'd have to be some sort of retard to try that.,And a Haymaker? A quick ag yuki would block that and the counters are up to you. (empi, etc),The only legit karate is Kyokushin and styles that derive from it like Shidokan, Enshin, Ashihara, Seidojuku, etc. Why? Because they practice knockdown karate. They condition their shins, knees, and hands while sparring hardcore. ,Back in 1964, Kyokushin was the ONLY karate style that successfully competed against Thai boxers.,Andy Hug, Bas Rutten, and GSP trained Kyokushin karate. ,This is what it looks like:,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gpu,In Shotokan we don't practice ""wacky hand maneuvers"" or any of that shit, at least not at my dojo. My sensei also teaches ground tactics and take downs. Although I do see your point being valid with a style such as Wado Ryu.,The problem with karate is that it got popularized too quickly in the 70's and 80's. You have too many black belt factories and McDojos were little emphasis on actual training is given. Instead, we have too many out-of-shape fatasses teaching people to do horse stances and punch in the air. ,You don't have this with Muay Thai too often because you HAVE to spar and hit the bags/pads. ,Basically, the ideal martial art whether striking or grappling needs to be like boxing or wrestling when you train. If it's a striking art, if you're not learning how to hit as well as take hits, you're learning shit. The same for grappling since you NEED a resisting partner when training.,Which is why I love my dojo, my sparring partner is fucking brutal, a cool guy, but when sparring he will fuck me up if my head isn't in it.,you're going to get punched in the jaw by anyone else if you try to use that shit,so it looks exactly like every other kind of karate, got it,They practice face-punching and kicks/knees to the face. This is only for tournaments. ,Other karate doesn't hit with the shins and knees like Kyokushin does. After fighting against Muay Thai, they picked up on shin conditioning.,don't exist in karate,blocking?,both bread and butter karate techniques,impossible to do to someone well trained in karate unless they are significantly outweighed,oh okay, then you guys are actually going to fuck everyone's day up.,This stuff makes me wish fencing was actually at all practical D:,Goju-ryu does,This. Especially Shotokan which specialises in deep stances. Tackles would be virtually impossible.,LOL, go back and watch the first UFC's, and see how the Gracies owned all the traditional Karatekas with takedowns.,UFC doesn't replicate a fight against a thug or mugger. We're talking fighting in the street not on the mat or in the ring.,This. You wouldn't be fighting against trained fighters in the street if you were a humble martial artist.,Do you actually believe this? You need to engage in full-contact training if you do.,Bullshit. Plenty of strikers won in the early UFC. Hell, UFC 1 had a Karate/Savate guy named Gerard Gordeau against Royce Gracie.,Yeah, neither do your katas. Do yourself a favor, instead of drinking your sensei's kool-aid, pad up and see if it works in full-contact. If it doesn't, don't do it.,and then when Royce Gracie fought Kazushi Sakuraba in a legitimate no rules fight he was absolutely massacred, flat out embarrassed.,Yes, and Royce beat him. What's your point?,If you aren't a skinny runt and actually assume a proper stance, I believe it.,what do you think a kata is for, dumbass? it is a warm up exercise.,It has already been mentioned, Katas are the formal side of Karate and only a fucking retard would use a Kata in a fight.,Walls make getting out of ground fighting situations easier, you jave another plane to leverage against them. The canvas is clear of obstacles such as dirt, sand, glass, lava, acid and industrial grade rape lubricant, making your footing more secure as well. Your stance will not prevent takedowns, you can still be single or double legged, hip tossed and tripped.,And Royce beat him in the rematch.,Not really, the cage (you can evade a takedown by leaning onto it), its size (ample room to evate takedowns with good footwork), its format (no hard corners to trap you when backpedalling from a takedown attempt), the time limits and the standups all favor strikers.,you are aware that TACKLE is the word that was used, not take down,also,you have that backwards, it makes the take down easier because you can push them against a wall which takes away their ability to hold a wide stance,and tested positive for steroids after the fight. He literally had to cheat to win.,Would you talk like that in your dojo? No? They why show that kind of disrespect here?,We're trying to build /asp/ as a place where martial artists can come and communicate with each other with respect. Try not to shit it up like the other boards.,I wasn't the guy that was positively responding to you guys but I was the poster of the original comment you were responding to. First and foremost, the modern idea of ""blocking"", karate being rather modern as it's only about 100-150 years old, is absurdly flawed. It is based on the assertion that combat is easy. What do I mean? There's an individual block for each individual attack. This suggests that the user of Karate, while in combat, would not only be calm enough to consider exactly what kind of attack is being thrown at him, but would also have enough time to think over the 100's of techniques he's learned to pick the correct one and then employ said block. That's the first issue with the blocking. I'll continue in the next post so that I don't just throw out a huge wall of text that nobody is going to read.,I wasn't showing any disrespect. I wasn't calling you a retard, I was simply stating only someone with a screw loose would attempt to do a kata during a real fight, I'm not in my dojo so I swore, the only sign of slight disrespect in that statement.,Continued from: ,So, the next issue with the blocking is that it's a bunch of wasted movement. Assuming that you were the kind of superman who would be able to throw out the exact block for the exact attack being thrown, you would still be left in a position, most often inside of the enemy's attack, with little to follow up with outside of some basic striking. Assuming your opponent is half trained, which it is safe to assume because everybody is training in something these days, most prominently boxing, he would know to get out of the way or to try to perry and counter. So, you're left with nothing but the same blocking motion in an infinite exchange of wasted effort with this individual. That is, of course, the best case scenario, because he probably has friends that are going to come up behind you and kick your teeth out as soon as it looks like he isn't dominating the situation. The warrior should strive to attack and to defend in one efficient motion. A great example of this would be the application of deflections and receptions, seen in more traditional Japanese martial arts like Dakentaijutsu. That's my other issue with the blocking.,Although, I apologise if you took offense. You should have read more carefully because it was not aimed at you.,90% of people you will get into a fight with are going to throw a big sloppy haymaker, there is not much thought in stopping that and the block should have a punch released from the other hand with both hitting at the same time.,Then lock up, knees, chokes, throws, and sweeps are all on the table.,Continued from: ,Let's consider some other aspects of Karate. First, the striking. Most of the punches, much like in other modern martial arts, under-utilize some of the more effective power sources in your body, namely tai ate (full body motion), haragaei (expression of the abdominal muscles), and koshi mawari (twisting of the body). Some of these certainly are utilized, but when done, it is through great lowering of your own defenses. Along with that, the majority of strikes in Karate are thrown at your opponents front. Along with under-utilizing flanking as a path to avoiding blocks or dodges, it also fails to take advantage of sensitive points in the body that can't take as much damage as the face or stomach and chest might i.e. the cerebral cortex, jaw hinge, and temple.,yall niggas no nutin about fighting you niggas be backflippin and shit and us hood niggas wud fuck yall niggas up,While I agree with you, I'd have to point out that people actually throw combos of wild haymakers which your average pre coordinated blocks are going to fail to disrupt. On top of that, since they are wild, it's hard to know where the blows will be landing. ,However, I was trained to believe that the superman method should be used when considering an opponent in a street fight. Meaning that he can take more pain than you can and is stronger and faster than you are. This is well exemplified if you consider fighting somebody on meth or PCP.,Continued from: ,The final thing I would like to say about striking in Karate is that it's too much work for too little gain. The amount of energy it takes to throw enough strikes to take somebody out is gargantuan. If we consider a boxing match, it's very rare to see somebody get knocked out in the first few minutes. The more likely event is that hundreds of punches are thrown by each fighter until somebody goes down. And that's just a boxing match. Nobody can train to stop from getting knocked out when it happens, unless your head is particularly large, the amount it takes to take somebody out with striking is not that subjective. Now, if we consider a life or death situation and what happens in the brain when somebody's life is threatened, i.e. a huge release of adrenaline and endorphins to significantly raise your opponent's tolerance for pain, not to mention their strength, speed, and stamina, striking becomes a moot point. ,Also to consider, a lot of Karate striking seems to be based on making contact with the back of your hand or the front of your foot. These are two of the weakest sets of bones in your body and you run an extremely high risk of simply breaking your own hand or foot by accidentally striking your opponent's knees or elbows.,Should I continue?,Please do.,Continued from: ,It should be made clear here that I view Karate as awesome in a sports setting. Lyoto Machida employs it very well in UFC, which I also love as a sport. ,Now, that whole rant was all about Kyokushin Karate. There are, however, other forms that employ aspects of grappling and joint locking. It should be first stated that there is a lack of emphasis on small joint manipulation, i.e. finger manipulation. Small joint manipulation is an excellent way to transition into large joint manipulation, but we can get into that later. Let's focus on the traditionally viewed application of Karate in striking as it transitions into joint locking. I was talking about flanking while striking in an earlier post, so if I would refer you to that bit before reading on. Or you can not, whatever you want. ,Flanking while striking does not only allow you to strike in places you normally wouldn't have access to, it also puts you in something called dominant positioning. If an individual is in dominant positioning, it means he is outside of his opponents attack, in a comfortable position after a deflection or a reception, and ideally in a position to proceed with a joint lock, whether it be fingers, wrist, forearm, elbow, shoulder, spine, whatever really. Striking, believe it or not, is one of the keys to joint locking. It not only has the potential to put you into dominant positioning from which you can use your body weight to dominate your opponent without having to expend a shit load of energy, it also momentarily stuns your opponent (if you're approaching this using the superman theory). If you've ever watched an mma match in which one guy is trying to submit the other, it becomes clear that locking is a relatively difficult thing to do. So, we have to assume that in order to break some bones, which render your opponent unable to move various portions of their bodies regardless of their strength or what drug their on, you would first need,Continued from: ,strike them a bunch of times. ,Most forms of Karate approach locking from their opponents' front and without trying to stun the opponent first, but rather throwing a few meager strikes their way that would only serve to anger them. On top of that, much like with striking, full body motion is under-utilized and you end up with two people using as much strength as they can to lock the other person up, which only serves to fatigue them, especially in the situation (using the superman method, we're assuming this is every situation) where your opponent has friends that are coming to help him. This is especially important if your trying to break bones or even succeed, in which case they'll be trying to really hurt you instead of just rough you up. This is a bit that I can get into later.,bamp,Bemp,Personally I like karate because I find it the most enjoyable to practice on my own. I follow along with a kihon dvd, do kata, hit a heavybag/do some whacko body conditioning stuff in replacement of free sparring. I pay a mat fee to join a class when I get the urge but I'm generally satisfied training on my own now.,dangerous art if you know how to use it...,Get off you high horse, More people are likely to get fucked up by a well timed hook/elbow/judo throw than from most elegant karate attacks,It's a great way to train your body, It's not a great way to learn how to fight.,I suck at posting.,If you actually looked at Karate you'd realise that Katas are the most elegant thing about it. And like it's been mentioned, no-one in their right mind uses Katas in real fights or sparring.,don't bother, they are all really jealous they don't have blackbelts. They put in a lot of time in their craft too but they have nothing physical to show for it, you can say I know how to kickbox and people will think ""yeah..who doesn't I do kickboxing with my personal trainer every Saturday, or I take a kickboxing class to stay in shape"" but if you say you have a blackbelt people think ""oh wow, this guy is fucking awesome"",It is pure unadulterated jelly and nothing more because nobody takes what they do seriously, so they desperately try to justify their choices to themselves by making assumptions about the classes they never took.,Can you imagine how deadly a martial arts master would be on PCP? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4E,you know shit was on because he dropped the chucks,naw son, Imma do it muhself,This is the most retarded, egocentric thing I've ever read. ,Anon, what the hell are you talking about? Doesn't anything beyond image matter to you? Your black belt might signify that you're ready to fight real challengers which, from the sound of it, you're not. All you're doing is hurting yourself. How long does it take to get a black belt in Karate? 1-2 years? Less if you pay your instructor more? ,I've been in my martial art, also Japanese, and I'm about to earn my second belt after a shit load of work. I have a feeling that I could tear you apart.,for 3 years*,took me 11 years to reach first dan,We don't even get regular yearly belt tests for promotions, you get a promotion when he feels you are ready for it.,What's the point of this? I could write a manga that says ""X"" technique always works as well.,do it faggot,I understand what you mean but a Black belt to me signifies that a person is a master of basics and ready to start on more advanced techniques, etc. And you say less if you pay your Sensei more? You're referring to the McDojo ""Pay me $100 and you'll be a black belt"" way. Black belt isn't just a belt, it's a state of mind and anyone who walks around feeling they can ""tear people apart"" without seeing them at least training then that person is nowhere near this Black Belt mentality.,A belt is just a piece of cloth used to keep your pants up.,I really hate that quote because it doesn't keep your pants up, it keeps your jacket closed,Which is exactly what I have just explained, in a different context.,My jacket has laces to keep it closed and my pants are elasticated so mine does neither.,my jacket has them too but they always manage to come undone, actually my main jacket the laces ripped off from throws and stuff.,my main pants have a draw string, the elastic pants I have had were the light fabric and always ripped,Yeah, my secondary gi jacket's laces ripped off too. My main's been going strong for a while now though.,I studied Shotokan for several years. Loved it.,Wrong!,It's fictitious but in theory it works.,No, it makes a bunch of assumptions, such as the pain being severe enough to stop his takedown, or that his opponent couldn't simply continue his motion and end up behind him instead of floating there. Now, liver shots hurt like hell and make you feel like you want to die, but that doesn't mean that they magically stop grappling just because they are painful in application, that of course assumes thatvhe can accurately bring his elbow down on his liver in the first place. If someone is lunging at you, ripping your balance out from under you and shoving you backwards all at the same time it can make it veryvhard to keep your footing And aim an accurate shot.,Lyoto Machida and Katsunori Kikuno are two of my favorite MMA fighters who have a major karate influence. Now i am not saying they only use Karate BUT both of them use karate concepts and techniques in full contact combat sports like MMA.,you should watch some Andy Hug, Glaube Feitosa, Francisco Filho, Keiji Ozaki and Seiji Takahashi fights,All of these people who think that the only aspect of a martial art is learning how to fight. I pity them.,I mean, sure, it's a big aspect, but it's not everything.,Also, sparring isn't necessary to learn a martial art. It's just another drill. You can do two-person exercises and forms and be able to defend yourself just as well.,OP, you'll do fine learning Karate. It's a well balanced martial art and I suspect you'll have a lot of fun. Chances are any fight you'll get into is going to be a barfight or something, so the other guy probably won't be some kind of judo champion.,inb4 tournaments, UFC, MMA. I don't believe in having rules while fighting, and I don't learn my martial arts so I can use them as some kind of lowly sport.,So you eye-gouge, bite, snap bones and break faces every time you practice? Oh, wait but you dont have to try hard or get hurt to learn how to defend yourself, just like how you can learn how you can learn how to drive a car by reading about it in a book. If you need mystical, authority based pupil and master relationships to learn a martial style, then fine. Dont pretend you're superior just because you don't like the sight of you own blood.,You are foolish. Your comparison is invalid and you should be ashamed.,Take traditional Okinawan Karate, traditional Kung Fu, or many other martial arts. All extremely deadly, but almost 100% kata/form practice and very RARELY any sparring.,Yes, there are two-person forms. They teach you how to apply your moves in combat.,Yes, there are two-person exercises. They teach you to have better reaction time and also condition you.,When I practice my two-person forms, I motion to eye-gouge, break bones, manipulate joints, dislocate elbows, etc. While in practice, ONLY strength is held back, not technique. We do constant conditioning exercises to make sure that we'll be able to apply the strength when we need to.,Many martial arts schools now will train people to do well in tournaments or MMA, teaching them only techniques that will do well in point sparring, and none of those moves that are banned from tournament sparring matches. My teacher once explained to me when I inquired about joining tournaments:,""That is just sport. We don't practice that here. Every tournament we've been to, we've been disqualified from."",This is the mentality I keep while practicing martial arts. Would you believe that some people actually believe that wearing gloves that prevent you from proper joint manipulation, training to hit anything but the face, and staying up until the next round are pure representations of their martial art?,How disappointing.,You just say things and expect them to be taken as truth. Two-Person forms do not teach you how to fight, they teach you the feel of the technique, but not the actual execution of it under non-ideal conditions. ,The strength and accuracy at speed are the hard parts, any one can practice a tecunique without strength or intent, because without them they are nothing more than particulairly complicated dance moves.,You guys are cowards, unable to adapt to a set of rules to test your art. There are more forms of competition besides UFC, for example there is the brazilian tradition of Vale Tudo, which allows many of the very strikes that your style is so practiced at. Karate didn't do well there either.,You are peaceful warriors, yet you can't abide by the rules that you agreed to.,Two-person forms do teach you how to fight. I know this from personal experience. It also teaches you to display your art properly instead of resorting to kickboxing techniques like most martial arts schools do while sparring.,Yes, because it sure shows a lack of intent when you only hit someone on the elbow instead of breaking it.,Half of the attacks I've been taught are small joint locks, strikes to the eyes, throat, and groin attacks. I mean, sure, I COULD very well go into tournament play, but would it show the extent of my ability? No. Do I want people judging me based on something that isn't my best? No.,I never said ""we're too deadly,"" just that most of our techniques are banned. There's literally no point in doing it if you can't do it 100%.,Bamp,ITT: People who have never been humbled by rolling in a BJJ class.,It is fucking terrifying just how easy it is to fuck someone up on the ground if you know what you're doing. Speaking as a Noob who has had 1 kickboxing fight and is getting into BJJ, the average white belt (1-2 stripes) in a jiu Jitsu class could probably tap your senseis. ,And what the fuck is up with all these ninja wannabes talking about how there's no rules on the street and I don't train for rules etc etc. MMA is the closest you can safely get to emulating a street fight. GFL using your 3rd dan black belt skills when i'm mounted on top of you.,I can tell you're speaking as a noob, you don't appreciate other martial arts, deflate your head, actually gain some fighting experience then come back and say what you want, but until then, please don't insult other fighting styles.,I appreciate them plenty, Taekwondo for example is fucking badass. What i don't appreciate is people talking about the traditional martial arts in the same way people did 50 years ago, generally speaking they are not ""street effective"" And i have had fighting experience. That was mentioned in the comment.,1 kickboxing fight isn't really a sufficient amount of experience for you to be egotistical and claim you could take a 3rd dan unless that fight was fucking brutal. Fight in the street before you tell me a martial art isn't ""street effective.,You guys always prattle on about respect and honor, yet you often shit on other styles yourself because they are ""Sports"" and not ""Traditional"" You know why martial arts die? Because they stop testing themselves, they close themselves off from the world and they start filling their art with all this nonsense thatvjas nothing to do with fighting,Some other Karateka may do this but I don't. I respect BJJ and accept that of the fighter is skilled and has been taught well they will be a good fighter, it's the same with most Martial Arts and indeed fighting sports. It just annoys me when you get people who do an art or sport and they are so egotistical and big headed, they act a if they could take the world. Also, I don't plan on closing myself off, I will continue training and indeed fighting.,I never said i could take a 3rd dan, Read the comment again broseph. And why am i going to go and get in a street fight to prove myself? Hypothetically speaking if i was to spar often (which i will be soon) That would be more actual fight training than most martial arts schools offer. In BJJ sparring (called rolling) You are going 100% the entire time, In Kickboxing sparring you are going 60-70% Higher if needed. How many traditional martial arts offer this kind of real life practice. No respectable martial artist is going to run around getting in street fights, Avoid conflict at all costs, isn't that one of the first rules of the traditional martial arts?,Chur bro, well put.,Captcha: Orgiali performance,TL;DR Go to a Braziallian Jiu Jitsu class, Roll with a blue belt, get tapped a bunch of times then reevaluate your stance.,Oh, I misread it, apologies.,Anyway, I didn't literally mean go and fight someone I was meaning that if you haven't been in a street fight, don't pretend you know what one's truly like. And I understand where you're coming from but in my dojo and most dojos close by me offer full contact sparring and my sparring parter is fucking brutal anyway, that aside, if the training is traditional in Karate, the student will eventually get 80% - 100% real-time sparring sessions at least once a week. Also, I could say the same to you, spar with a purple belt (which I think is the equivalent) who has actually trained at a good club with a good instructor and tell me all this again.,What is the name of this tournament?,not to mention that any decent karateka will knee a tackler in the face just as fast as a muai thai fighter.,I agree with this, blocking if used should be treated as a form of striking. You shouldn't block just to avoid a strike, you should block to hit your opponent really hard in the offending limb so that they don't use it again. The best way to avoid a hit is to deflect, grab, or best of all, avoid the strike.,I wonder when the principle of blocking to strike was lost in favor of ""blocks are like your shield and should be nothing but defense and your only defense"".,I started in karate but moved on to Dakentaijutsu and Jujutsu (karate helped as a starting block and I still have a lot of respect for it). I couldn't agree more with your point about the under-utilization of flanking, it seems like modern karate tends to work under the kickboxing principle that you line up with your opponent and deliver strikes from directly in front of them and only move forward or backward as if it was a fencing match.,UFC 2,You are delusional my friend.,it depends on what kind of tackle we are talking about and what kind of stance. A horse stance where you are facing your opponent will NOT stop you from being ""football"" tackled, if your opponent has enough momentum. A wide stance where your weight is evenly on both legs, your center of gravity is low, and one leg is behind the other will stop most ""football"" tackles, especially if you are a larger individual.,No stance will stop any and all types of takedowns that use leverage instead of just pure momentum and inertia.,However, if someone is running up to tackle you, your best option is not to just stand there and assume a stance. Use their momentum against them with a strike or throw, or at least dodge them.,It worries me that people actually believe shit like this.,It does actually work sometimes, if you are able to absorb the impact of the tackle with your rear leg or take a step back. It even works decently if their tackle works and you are in the middle of falling because elbows to the spine or the back of the neck are not fun.,but there are no rules on the streets,http://www.veoh.com/watch/v17175722",,"03/31/13(Sun)04:39,03/31/13(Sun)04:44,03/31/13(Sun)05:25,03/31/13(Sun)05:43,03/31/13(Sun)05:44,03/31/13(Sun)05:55,03/31/13(Sun)08:34,03/31/13(Sun)11:01,03/31/13(Sun)12:05,03/31/13(Sun)12:39,03/31/13(Sun)12:44,03/31/13(Sun)13:10,03/31/13(Sun)13:19,03/31/13(Sun)13:23,03/31/13(Sun)13:24,03/31/13(Sun)13:37,03/31/13(Sun)13:55,03/31/13(Sun)14:02,03/31/13(Sun)14:08,03/31/13(Sun)14:24,03/31/13(Sun)15:42,03/31/13(Sun)16:04,03/31/13(Sun)17:05,03/31/13(Sun)17:07,03/31/13(Sun)17:07,03/31/13(Sun)17:11,03/31/13(Sun)17:14,03/31/13(Sun)17:14,03/31/13(Sun)17:18,03/31/13(Sun)17:23,03/31/13(Sun)17:25,03/31/13(Sun)17:26,03/31/13(Sun)17:27,03/31/13(Sun)17:29,03/31/13(Sun)17:30,03/31/13(Sun)17:30,03/31/13(Sun)17:31,03/31/13(Sun)17:33,03/31/13(Sun)17:36,03/31/13(Sun)17:38,03/31/13(Sun)17:39,03/31/13(Sun)17:40,03/31/13(Sun)17:40,03/31/13(Sun)17:42,03/31/13(Sun)17:42,03/31/13(Sun)17:43,03/31/13(Sun)17:43,03/31/13(Sun)17:44,03/31/13(Sun)17:44,03/31/13(Sun)17:45,03/31/13(Sun)17:46,03/31/13(Sun)17:48,03/31/13(Sun)17:49,03/31/13(Sun)17:49,03/31/13(Sun)17:50,03/31/13(Sun)17:51,03/31/13(Sun)17:52,03/31/13(Sun)17:54,03/31/13(Sun)17:58,03/31/13(Sun)17:58,03/31/13(Sun)18:06,03/31/13(Sun)18:07,03/31/13(Sun)18:13,03/31/13(Sun)18:13,03/31/13(Sun)18:21,03/31/13(Sun)18:32,03/31/13(Sun)18:35,03/31/13(Sun)19:03,03/31/13(Sun)19:12,03/31/13(Sun)19:38,04/01/13(Mon)01:19,04/01/13(Mon)05:14,04/01/13(Mon)07:27,04/01/13(Mon)07:48,04/01/13(Mon)07:49,04/01/13(Mon)10:47,04/01/13(Mon)12:39,04/01/13(Mon)12:57,04/01/13(Mon)13:09,04/01/13(Mon)13:22,04/01/13(Mon)13:23,04/01/13(Mon)13:27,04/01/13(Mon)14:36,04/01/13(Mon)14:37,04/01/13(Mon)14:38,04/01/13(Mon)14:47,04/01/13(Mon)14:50,04/01/13(Mon)15:22,04/01/13(Mon)15:31,04/01/13(Mon)15:32,04/01/13(Mon)15:34,04/01/13(Mon)15:35,04/01/13(Mon)15:53,04/01/13(Mon)15:58,04/01/13(Mon)16:57,04/01/13(Mon)18:42,04/01/13(Mon)19:02,04/01/13(Mon)19:14,04/01/13(Mon)19:20,04/01/13(Mon)19:32,04/01/13(Mon)19:42,04/01/13(Mon)19:50,04/01/13(Mon)20:01,04/01/13(Mon)20:06,04/01/13(Mon)20:18,04/01/13(Mon)20:59,04/01/13(Mon)21:17,04/02/13(Tue)02:48,04/02/13(Tue)02:57,04/02/13(Tue)03:03,04/02/13(Tue)03:16,04/02/13(Tue)03:28,04/02/13(Tue)03:31,04/02/13(Tue)03:40,04/02/13(Tue)03:43,04/02/13(Tue)03:53,04/02/13(Tue)05:16,04/02/13(Tue)06:20,04/02/13(Tue)06:28,04/02/13(Tue)06:32,04/02/13(Tue)07:44,04/02/13(Tue)07:47,04/02/13(Tue)07:57,04/02/13(Tue)07:57,04/02/13(Tue)07:59,04/02/13(Tue)08:35,04/02/13(Tue)08:42","Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting

"So, people have started disliking this movie just because it won Best Picture? That seems pretty gay.,I mean, I'm not saying it was worthy of Best Picture, but anyone can see that it was absolutely top-notch.,close calls: the movie,boring as fuck,No they haven't. Do you just make stuff up and then start believing it?,This,Plus the shaky cam forced realism is so fucking annoying.,I thought that was only mediocre before it won best picture. I thought less of it after it beat Brokeback.,This movie is not universally accepted as the next great film from an ascending director.,I found it pretty boring and aimless. It had that passive propaganda quality where the posturing suggests some sort of outside perspective but really just fulfills a typically patriotic thriller. ,Ben Affleck is increasingly becoming shit in opinion. He nailed it with his first film, balancing humor, drama, character development, and a familiar formula implemented in an interesting and somewhat novel way, and managed to conclude it with a final shot that conveyed a meaning greater than the story itself.,Then he decided he spent enough time off screen and completely gave up on committing himself to the development of his directing abilities, so in stead of something new and intriguing out of the struggle to improve a new craft he reverts to everything he knows based on his acting career, which is how to be a protagonist in crowd pleasing vacuous films.,The depressing thing is cinematography really is top notch and if he could just kill the part of his ego that is attached to his being seen as an important actor he has the potential to live up to some of the hype thats being generated about him, at the moment he is in a downwards trajectory.,Hopefully his next movie is received with some more critical consideration and the insecurity that causes him wakes him up sufficiently to start work on a worthwhile project in his fifth attempt.,ITT: favorite actors/actresses who have incestuous relationships IRL,I don't see any incest in those photos though.,I would say pulling down your sister's panties would be on the border of committing incest,you can convert but that probably wouldn't lead to you banging your nieces,unless you got them to convert too,Maybe in America. I don't see anything incestuous about helping your sister change clothes.,Continued from ,I for one don't hate her because she's not in the books. It's just that we get a lot of screentime from sex scenes and such, and scenes like Margaery and Loras talking in S2 gets shoehorned.

"I am going to be running an open martial arts tournament because cage fighting is lame and has too many rules,there are no rounds and no time limit or referee stoppages, fights are bare knuckle,you can win by,knockout (you get a 10 count if knocked out),forfeit,or by ring out (the ring is 40'x40' and slightly elevated, if you get tossed you had no control over or awareness of your position and deserve to lose),There are however some basic rules to keep things sporting,prohibited moves are,biting,small joint manipulation (breaking fingers and toes),attacks to the eyes,intentionally penetrating any orifice of your opponent,ear pulling,intentional attacks to the genitals,attacking an unconsious or downed* opponent [*unable to reasonably defend themselves],and intentionally causing the death of an opponent,additional rules,all takedowns must be followed up with a technique, you can not simply lay on top of someone and not be attacking or advancing position.,Standing 8 counts may be given to people who get back to their feet after a 10 count was initiated on them.,In event of a double ring out, victory will be awarded to whoever touched the ground second.,would you like to play? or perhaps just watch.,I already have people interested in fighting in this thing.,suggestions on making it better are also welcome,Sounds like too many rules,where are you OP?,why doesn't 4chan have a meet up/throwdown.,Phoenixfag here. bjj blue belt under megaton diaz.,MN fag here, i'd be into it. The rules sound about on, though id add hair pulling. We'd need some pretty serious waivers for this shit.,i wouldnt mind a meetup,sf bay area fag here,NY, no fun allowed here so I have been driven under ground,this would be easier in brazil, of course if someone has a party boat it could be done in international waters,Hey Shang-Tsung, if you can find the guy then jawesome. Could we use handwraps?,I have given hand wraps some thought, I even considered allowing fighters to mix and match what ever kind of padding they would want as long as they both agree to it.,my reasoning for bare knuckle however is that it really changes the nature of the fight, you will see a lot more open hand and kick centric stand up when you do not have that extra hand protection.,The idea is to create something visually different from your standard MMA, I also predict the lack of ropes or walls for someone to be cornered on will really change the accessibility of a ground game, especially when there is a danger of being redirected out of the ring for a loss.,I just like the wraps because I can punch harder woth them. Im not sure the lack of a cage will stop ground-fighting, as the walls can be both an asset and detriment to a ground specialist. If anything I think the rules will enable stand-up grappling like Judo or Wrestling, since a ring-out is the quickest path. How long could clinches be maintained, would they have similar restrictions like ground-fighting?,the point of the time limit on grapple techniques is because there no weight classes as of now, and it is to avoid allowing the bigger person to simply hold the smaller one in place while they figure out what to do with them. If your techniques are not connected you are not fighting.,and the lack of walls is one thing, the loss by ring out is what may deter ground fighting in certain situations. A take down is risky if you have been worked towards the edge, it can be twisted and even if you have control you may still be the first one to touch down on the outside and lose.,It changes the way a fighter will use their environment.,Sounds like you all watch a bit too much wrastlin'.,I mean this SOUNDS cool, but holy shit, you could get like seriously fucked up. And why not allow handwraps or anything? That's just like saying we'd prefer you to get hurt. How are you going to referee this? What if someone is trained in a joint destruction style or something like that, there's not even any rules against that. ,You're all a bit fucking crazy. This will be like felony fights, but with more deaths.,Be prepared for the most boring/quick fights you've ever seen. Did you know that in bare-knuckled boxing there was an average of 2-3 punches a round? Yeah, fuck that shit.,people will know what they are getting in to,sounds fun to me,Yeah bit those bare-knuckle fights could go for dozens of rounds, due to the fact that the round was stopped when one of the combatants was downed. Thus, if you just got your bell ring hard, you could slam you opponent down and give yourself a minute breather. It is still flash-knouckouts ahoy though.,Yeah, thats the main thing that gives me pause. I've been in a heater or two in my day, but its pretty hard to trust a bunch of people you juat met Mortal Kombat style.,Funny I just spent my day getting fucked senseless by mushroom parents.,And I think some serious thought should be put into this before it's put into motion. I would never put myself in the position of having my neck broken or knee kicked in. That sounds like so many worlds of awful.,I realise this is extreme, but everything that's allowed, CAN in theory be done, so it needs to be very carefully regulated if it's going to be safe.,Again, agreement. I love the idea of fighting some motherfucker and representing 'muh grapplan' at some sort Enter the Dragon style set-up, but I dont want to be that dude who gets crushed in half and thrown aside, and a boat in international waters or (ugh) brazil allow that possibility a bit too much.,uh please speak to a lawyer about not being legally responsible for all the shit that goes wrong with this,technically in new jersey formal duels are still legal on the books. So each fight could be declared a duel and then there is no liability.,dualing is also still legal in Washington state. In fact you can have ""legal"" street fights with cops as witness/observes and they will let you duke it out without fear of arrest. Whole reason why that vigilante Phoenix Jones gets away with using his MMA skills in beating the shit out of perps.,Just because the legal problems have been cleared up, it doesn't really solve the fact that people can be maimed really bad with these rules.,any weight classes or is it going to be dominated by super heavy weights?,Post where you're going to hold it. It should be amusing to watch the kind of dim-witted meatheads that would agree to this beat each other to death.,I think you should include an entrance fee so you can have a pot to give to the winner or divy up between the top 3 places as you see fit. It's hard to get people to agree to sustain great bodily harm for free.,i wanna watch, will you be streaming?,+1 for wraps",,"04/02/13(Tue)00:29,04/02/13(Tue)00:55,04/02/13(Tue)00:58,04/02/13(Tue)01:01,04/02/13(Tue)01:03,04/02/13(Tue)01:04,04/02/13(Tue)01:11,04/02/13(Tue)01:19,04/02/13(Tue)01:28,04/02/13(Tue)01:37,04/02/13(Tue)01:41,04/02/13(Tue)01:47,04/02/13(Tue)01:52,04/02/13(Tue)01:56,04/02/13(Tue)02:00,04/02/13(Tue)02:22,04/02/13(Tue)02:23,04/02/13(Tue)02:34,04/02/13(Tue)02:37,04/02/13(Tue)02:42,04/02/13(Tue)02:57,04/02/13(Tue)04:47,04/02/13(Tue)04:53,04/02/13(Tue)09:07,04/02/13(Tue)09:08","Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"

"mfw 4chan doesn't know why capoeria have all these moves and they think these moves are useless. noobs,They aren't useless. They are inefficient and tiring in comparison toother styles. Sure, 1 in 100 times he'll like, leap off the ground and kick you in the face or clap your ears or whatever, but usually they'll just miss and waste a bunch of energy.,I used to be a beginner capoerista about 10 years ago, but decided to pursue the other art I was studying. I LOVED it, but my heart was elsewhere. However, it was incredibly rich in culture and art and life, something that is horribly lacking in most martial arts at least here in the US. ,These days, most modern martial arts tend to lose the cultural and historical aspects of their origins in favor of effectiveness of technique; worse yet, some are easily dismissed entirely because they would 'never work in a street fight'. Most martial arts were (and are) developed with the intention of preserving life in the face of imminent danger, be it armed or unarmed. Without studying or understanding a system or art's past or history, all that's left is a rigid structure with no flavor; it'd be like (and I know this is a horribly analogy) saying all you need for a body is the bones, muscles, minimal organs and fluids. ,I personally think Capoeira is fun and definitely a hell of a workout. Plus, women who are capoeiristas are some of the hottest and fittest martial artists out there :),Why is it a horrible that they lack it? I don't give a shit about some nationalist line of crap, or some stories about the art that are probably half-truths at best. I care about what I can train reliably and use reliably. You can have your padding and excuses, i'm training to fight, not toblearn about some far off land that has no effect on my life.,Go read a fucking book if you want toblearn about another culture.,Dancing is not fighting.,Why waste so much energy on moves that DO NOTHING just so you can tire yourself out.,Fighting and martial arts is about small, precise, and surgical movements which use energy efficiently.,Wushu, Caponigger, Shaolin, etc., are just gymnastics.,No, you're supposed to fight with beauty and grace and blah blah blah blah. I understand what you mean. People only like shit like that because it's visually impressive and they make the mistake that just because it is phsically intense, it means they can fight.,so learn krav maga or whatever the /k/ ""cqc style of the month"" is. if you don't give a shit about what capoeria has to offer, then don't study it. it's honestly simple as that,judging from your posts though it sounds like you haven't fought since you got into a little tussle at the flag pole in 5th grade,Go back to your Roda and practice some more no-touch jazzercise. You obviouslydon't want to actually learn to fight,Oh, and fuck Krav, most of that RBSD is bullshit pain-compliance,why is reading a book about a foreign culture better than actually participating in it?,also why is learning to fight a better use of time than capoeira?,this,capoeria is a beautiful and enjoyable art, but next to useless if i guy knocks your teeth out at a bar,Perhaps Capoeria is just suffereing from the same disease infecting many traditional martial arts. Shaolin was once an effective and fearsome martial art, when it was practiced as a form of real combat and how good your kung-fu was could be a matter of life-or dealth. However, in modern times it has been stripped of many of the old training methods that are ""too brutal"" for modern times, and the people that practice it are doing it to be performers or with the idea in mind that they're going to be the next Jackie Chan. This has led to watered down technique where the focus is on being pretty and not grabbing someone's trachea with a tiger claw. We started adding rules and point sparring and some martial arts were turned into spectator sports.,Many martial arts have fallen ill with this horrible cancer: Many styles of kung-fu, taekwondo, boxing, wrestling, and karate are all dying of this. Soon they will be nothing but flashy arm flailing and dance competitions unless the practitioners of these arts start putting the ""martial"" back into their martial art.,Capoeria could have once been combat effective. I can see hints of it in the way a Meo Lua de Compasso works as an evasion movement where the leg comes up in a circle, connects with the heel, and gives the opponent a surprise knockout. It's beautiful in principle, but all of the practicality has been drained out of it when it's practiced like a breakdancing move.,I just wish the martial artists practicing these watered down arts would wake up and fight back for their martial way.,Seconded, it's nice acrobatics adn dancing, but a martial art is something different.,It's cool, but it's not fighting.,Source: capoerista",,"04/01/13(Mon)23:17,04/01/13(Mon)23:36,04/02/13(Tue)00:37,04/02/13(Tue)01:08,04/02/13(Tue)01:11,04/02/13(Tue)01:14,04/02/13(Tue)01:14,04/02/13(Tue)01:22,04/02/13(Tue)01:40,04/02/13(Tue)02:26,04/02/13(Tue)08:18,04/02/13(Tue)08:19,04/02/13(Tue)09:09","Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"
