Up until September 2008, he was Yahoo!`s chief data officer and executive vice president of Research & Strategic Data Solutions. Fayyad was the industry`s first chief data officer, responsible for Yahoo!`s global data strategy, architecting Yahoo!`s data policies and systems, prioritizing data investments, and managing the Company`s data analytics and data processing infrastructure. Fayyad also founded and managed the Yahoo! Research organization with offices around the world. Yahoo! Research is building the premier scientific research organization to develop the new sciences of the Internet, on-line marketing, and innovative interactive applications.,Prior to joining Yahoo!, Fayyad co-founded and led the DMX Group, a data mining and data strategy consulting and technology company that was acquired by Yahoo! in 2004. DMX Group International still operates in the Middle East and is headquartered in Dubai. In early 2000, he co-founded and served as CEO of Revenue Science, Inc.(digiMine, Inc.), a data analysis and data mining company that built, operated and hosted data warehouses and web analytics for some of the world`s largest enterprises in online publishing, retail, manufacturing, telecommunications and financial services. The company today specializes in Behavioral Targeting and advertising networks. Fayyad`s professional experience also includes five years spent leading the data mining and exploration group at Microsoft Research and building the data mining products for Microsoft`s server division. From 1989 to 1996 Fayyad held a leadership role at NASA`s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), where his work in the analysis and exploration of scientific databases gathered from observatories, remote-sensing platforms and spacecraft garnered him the top research excellence award that Caltech awards to JPL scientists, as well as a U.S. Government medal from NASA.",Founder & CEO,"KDD

"Jean-Gabriel Ganascia is presently Professor of computer science at Paris VI University. He leads in the LIP6 laboratory (Laboratoire d'Informatique de Paris VI) the ACASA team. ,Initially focused on Knowledge Acquisition and Machine Learning, the scientific orientations of the ACASA team evolved to Cognitive Modeling and the design of Intelligent Agents. Thus was recently undertaken research on the literary analysis (genetic criticism, stylistic analysis), on modeling social representations (rebuilding of social stereotypes from newspapers), on Scientific Discovery (modeling theories in physical sciences and medicine), on musicology and music (detection of recurrent patterns, simulation of improvisations), on didactic, on multi-media, on intelligent TV and on the improvement of electronic reading facilities.,In a word, our scientific aim is to show that Artificial Intelligence is not only part of the sciences of nature that investigates the natural phenomenon; it is also a science of culture, which influences the production of knowledge today. ,Jean-Gabriel Ganascia published more than 350 papers in conferences proceedings, journals and books. In addition he has published many books and papers about philosophical issues and social consequences of the development information technologies (e.g. ""L’âme machine"" ed. du Seuil, ""2001, l’Odyssée de l’esprit"" ed. Flammarion, ""Gédéon"" and ""Les Sciences cognitives"" ed. Le Pommier, ""Idées reçues sur l’intelligence artificielle"" ed. du Cavalier Bleu, etc.). ,For a few years now, he worked on the ethics and political philosophy of the information society. His last book ""Voir et pouvoir: qui nous surveille?"" is issued from this work. It explores the ethical and political structure of our contemporaneous society. It relies on the notion of Catopticon, which extends the Bentham's Panopticon to a generalized ""sousveillance"" where everybody can watch everybody. ",full professor,"ICCS

" I was born in JinHua (near ShangHai), China, on December 25, some years ago. As a child, I did not know what Christmas was. (Who cared about those foreigners anyway, they were all Paper Tigers). I always complained to my mother: ""Why didn't you hold me for one day longer so I would have the same birthday as Chairman Mao!"",Following Chairman Mao's call, I went to the countryside to receive ""re-education"" from the Poor and Lower Middle Peasants after high school. I grew rice, tea, and peanuts and learned how to use Water buffalo in the fields and how to ride them home after a long and hard working day. Life was hard then, especially when we were told we would be there forever. I remember on a cold winter evening, I found a dusty old high school textbook in my only suitcase and started to fiddle with it. A friend came by and said: ""well, it may be useful for you someday, but not for us."" After that, I was motionless and started staring into the darkness outside my window......,Well, I have no complaints about those days --- they taught me well what life is about. After Chairman Mao died, the universities were reopened for public entrance examinations and I went to Beijing to attend the universities there. I did well all the way through and was honored to be selected to study abroad after graduation. In Beijing, I met two important people in my life: my wife Sai-Ying and my advisor Herbert A. Simon.,The rest of the story is ordinary by American standards. I learned how to speak English and how to drive (my first car was a Dodge Dart for $275). I flew a Cessna (never got my pilot's license though) and owned a sailboat. In the summer of 1996, I started enjoying driving a Mercedes-Benz 300E. Despite all these, I don't think I have changed much, I always followed the meaning of ""Wei Min"" (i.e., ""To serve the people"" in English), a principle given to me by my parents since I was born.","Director,

"Professor Provost studies data mining, knowledge systems, and machine learning and about their alignment with business problems.   He teaches graduate courses on information technologies and how they affect business and business strategy. ,Prof. Provost is Editor-in-Chief of the journal Machine Learning.  He won IBM Faculty Awards in 2000 and in 2001 for outstanding research in data mining and machine learning.  He was elected as a founding board member of the International Machine Learning Society. He is a member of the editorial boards of the Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR) and the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR).  In 2001, he co-chaired the program of the premier data mining conference (KDD-2001). ,His special issue of the journal Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, on eCommerce and Data Mining, is available as a book. A Machine Learning editorial essay of his has been recommended reading for authors of applied research papers. ,Professor Provost advises small and large companies who are interested in extracting useful knowledge from their data.  He served as an expert witness on a recent case involving customer profiling and fraud detection systems.  He also advises the U.S. Government (National Science Foundation, NASA, DARPA, National Research Council, White House Office of Science and Technology Policy) on policy and investments in data mining research. ,He has applied advanced technologies to a variety of business problems, including fraud detection and customer contact management.  For the last ten years, his research has focused on the issues involved with aligning data mining technologies with real-world problems, making several notable technical advances including robust modeling in the face of imprecision in the business environment, and profiling/monitoring on-line activity.
