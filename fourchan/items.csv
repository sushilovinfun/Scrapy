"This board is for discussion of sports other than the major professional sports.,This includes topics such as skydiving, surfing, skateboarding, rock-climing, bungee-jumping, BMX, and 'extreme' sports of all types. ,Discussions of professional sports teams, leagues and athletes should be posted on /sp/, and discussions of eSports should be posted on /vg/.,Jousting thread!,lame, based on that terrible show that was on tv it seems more luck based than skill based,I liked that show, fuck you. Also it's not really luck based, it's more like fighting on a boat.,Also Crispin died yesterday ;_;,Old thread hit the bump limit ,Maybe if the place is well-lit, but in my experience most indoor fields have pretty poor lighting.,you go to camp pendleton too? We've got to play some woodball together,Any recommendations on gloves? Fucking, it seems like Empire is the only company that makes gloves and they're shit tier quality.,golf gloves > professional gloves,I like fingerless bike gloves, but BLACKHAWK!, Hatch, Camelback, WileyX, and Oakley all make great gloves. You just have to step out of the ""for paintball"" mentality and look at military gear, too.,Pictured: My favorite set of gloves when I was active duty. I carried a pair at all times.,/asp/ will ultimately be a ultimate frisbee thread,am i right or am i rite,Yes. Yes. Dear god yes.,Why can't people appreciate this is exactly what it's about.,any recommendations on discs?,come on everyone knows that ultimate is all about looking good,discraft 175-ultrastar. get nothing else besides this. I know Inova is coming out with a disc soon, but it will probably suck.,Best sport out there.,Are we not discussing Smackdown?,Discuss it. Johnny Ace is returning,It's a shitty promo,but at least the WWE champion is actually cutting a promo on Smackdown...this show has been dead in the water this year ,I was watching the first ever smackdown on youtube a few weeks back and forgot how awesome it used to b,sup /asp/,where the ultimate players at?,also how improve my hammer? they always angle back towards the end of flight,I usually just think of throwing a hammer like I throw a football, same kind of motion..,just look up some Brodie Smith videos on youtube... that man is simply a beast!,also, its about fucking time an Ultimate thread was created!,anybody watched the recent ultimate tourney in Japan where the US All Stars went pretty deep on japanese players?!,no this tourney happened like last month.,brodie smith and the rest of USA went ham until the finals when ""Buzz Bullets"" beat them in the finals. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvwI,My hammers used to be terrible. All I can say is just spend a few days practicing those only. I like to bend my body to the left (I'm right-handed) and really focus on snapping that wrist at the end with a tight grip. Hopefully this helps, OP.,Also, in regards to them bending back, just focus on the angle of the disc pre-release. If that doesn't help, just try throwing it a little to the left/right depending on which way it will bend to counteract it.,I'm thinking about trying parkour. What should I know about it? Is there anything you wish you had known when you started? I'd also love to hear stories from people about particularly awesome practices, times when it was was actually very useful for you, etc.,Pic related, I'd *really* rather avoid that. I'm going to start with just getting used to the warmup exercises and then learning to roll inside on carpet, or on grassy, softer ground.,viva la bump,wear a helmet when you test your limits so that when you eat shit you won't shatter your face,That's actually a pretty great idea. What about pads and such?,anybody? ;~;,Just work out. Parkour will come in time.,does /asp/ have any tips for homemade sliding gloves? My landyachtz pair broke, and i don't want to pull money out of my ass for another pair.,I just can't get those coleman slides w/o gloves; it fucks up my hands!,pic related-me and my bitch,when i started listening to OF they were not ""trending."" In fact it was a little before the Radical mix tape was released,odd future have always been garbage except for Bastard and Earl but even those are mediocre,I'm going to stop here and save this for /mu/, but i have to agree their newer stuff isn't as good. Bastard, Earl, and yellowhite are great albums, and wolf is more deep than most of their stuff.,Counter top samples, what type of material, I mean so long as it's sturdy you'll be fine, all my longboaring buddies make their own gloves unless they are on a team or something. ,Anyone longboarding in NYC area?,austin texas,Humans vs. Zombies (also called HvZ for short) is a live-action game predominantly played at US college campuses where players begin as Humans and try to survive in a story where Zombies have begun to rise from the dead. The ultimate goal of the game is for either all Humans to be turned into Zombies, or for the humans to survive a set amount of time. Humans can defend themselves using any item that is approved by a moderator and thereby deemed safe and appropriate, but the most common equipment includes balled up socks, marshmallows, and foam dart guns. With these items, the goal is to hit a Zombie player with a thrown or launched item, thus stunning the Zombie player; Zombies are unarmed and must tag the Humans to gain a kill and, in some cases, avoid ""starvation"", thus forcing them out of the game. Safe zones are established so that players can eat and sleep in safety.,I'd say one in eight players is a girl, by what I saw. Probably more like 1/14.,There's gonna be a Bay Area-wide game starting in I believe April. Search for ""Humans Vs. Zombies (Bay Area)"" on Facebook. What part of the bay area are you in?,You sound about 16.,Holy fucking shitballs, Batman! An HvZ thread!,Heading up to a game tonight to NPC and meet some friends. Going to Penn in a few weeks as well. ,...I am now trying to put names to each post. I've been around for awhile and met a lot of people.,Fuck me, this sounds cool: whats the scene like in the UK? Other question is; how do you know who is a zombie and who isn't - moreover, how do you know who's playing and who isn't?,Not sure what it's like in the UK, the main website has a map showing all registered games I think. Zombies wear a headband and humans wear one around their upper arm (or upper leg in some games),http://boards.420chan.org/wooo/res/,Oh fuck,He was supposed to follow in his father's footsteps,RIP ;_;,Because after awhile all the WWE threads are getting tiring. Alternative Wrestling general.,Calm down, don't worry. This thread is about the other types of wrestling- Folkstyle, Freestyle, Greco-Roman- all that jazz! It's hard, but fun!,More info, basic moves, other stuff-,http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Folkst,Wrestling clubs help with that shit.,You can also just google essential moves- they show you stuff. ,Setting up a shot is just about making the arms useless/catching him off guard. This is why you see people grab the wrists- they do it so they can't use their arms to protect from the shot.,Also bamp.,Folk style in highschool,Weight class? 145ish? I don't even remember what they were, but I was in that range.,Age started wrestling? Freshman year,Favorite move? Crucifix, Cradle, Toe rides,Any memorable matches?,-I'm from one of those families known for the sport they're all good at, but my dad was the artist who went to college among a bunch of redneck deerhunters. Beat my cousin who had been wrestling since he could walk in the last couple seconds.,-Pinned a guy who still had a leg ride in on me, twisted him around me so hard he started bleeding internally, felt bad but awesome story.,-Caused three arm injuries out of 3 matches one day by sheer coincidence, my Lit teacher was announcing and we were doing Beowulf that week. Guess what my new nickname was.,-Had a moment of inspiration in a match and leapt clean over a kid to put him into a sort of flying crucifix. My entire team stood up and screamed ""NACHOOOOOOO"" when the ref lifted my hand.,How good were/are you? Kinda shit at first, but I was flexible and had some tricks. Ended my Senior year with only 3 losses, 2 of which were to the same guy, but I got pretty sick the week before Districts and couldn't make it.,Record? Not sure, was about 50% wins freshman year, improved until I got to only 3 losses as stated above.,flying curifix haha thats brilliant ,one time this guy had the weird on one knee stance almost like a three point stance and i did a 180 forward roll over his back and dropped into a single leg shit was so cash,Anybody in senegalese folk wrestling?,Or Georgian forl wrestling?,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3Hp,Tis a shame, because Greco-Roman looks like fun on a bun.,You know.... this doesn't actually look that bad,Is that Cody Rhodes witha pornstache?,Yes, and it's over as fuck,Can't say the same for poor Cody,he reinvents himself with success all the time. just that sandow is really awesome too. ,Cant remember the last time he did a cartwheel though.,Good one.,Is that it?,Shit. It makes sense.,Need to know peoples opinions on this,The difference between a tap and a break is a matter of just a little bit more effort. I doubt that you guys practice actively snapping each others limbs, and likely train to submission, whch is excatly how BJJ and Jiu-Jitsu generally train.,Wing chun was here,,Well I guess your disarming techniques are cool.,we train them with a jerking motion, not an easing one, we just don't pull as hard as we can.,if we are stomping someones head in we will stop just before contact or just tap them with the strength of a jab or so.,accidental injuries have happened.,I'm recovering from a finger that was slammed jammed against the floor during rolls, I can understand that much. ,So, you're saying you do the technique fluidly, with speed? We do that too.,Wouldn't that teach you to hesitate before stamping someone's face in?,nah, the fight is already won at that point, a follow through is no problem at all.,what kind of lines do you have?,wich style is your preferred?,how often do you go/train?,north italy.. near to the dolomites,bamp,I had a 25mm austri alpin line, but i've fucked it up and completely core shot it. austri-alpin since stopped making their awesome longline extensions, so i've swapped to elephant blue wing, which should arrive in the mail soon.,Generally I do tree-tree short high lines. My next project is to walk between the arches underneath this bridge, I've already done a test climb and now i'm just waiting for my new line. http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/F,I wanna get into this, can you point me in the direction of lines/info videos OP?,Check out NWslacklining. It's ran by one of the smartest and safest slackliners there. (NWslackline.org),If there is a local climbing store or outdoors store, go there and get this:,4 Blackdiamond oval carabiners ($6ish dollars each),2 one inch belay rings. Single chain links do the job too.,60ft of one inch (25mm) tubular climb/mil/slack spec webbing (any of those will due),two 15ft of webbing, REI sells 30ft pieces cheaper than by the foot. Or you can buy 90ft total and cut it into 15ft, 15ft, and 60ft segments, make sure to melt the ends.,Check out this video for explanation on how to rig it! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDz,What's a good martial art to train at for someone that is skinny, wants to be able to defend himself, and also has a relatively large learning curve (something that you can keep getting better at for years)?,do aikido. shitload of time, you'll get ridiculosly good results. or daito-ryu,If you seriously need it for self defense, you should consider visiting , and getting some tips on bulking up (read the sticky before posting any threads, though), as being big works pretty well for deterring someone from starting a fight in the first place.,Of course it would still be a good idea to do some sort of martial art, but I can't really help you there.,If you need it because you'd like to get in a fight (and actually stand a chance), then you're just a faggot with a small man's complex.,oh lord. there we go.,What? Bulking is the best way to get big, fast. I'm not saying he has to go on a 1000 calorie surplus PERMABULK, but bulk/cutting is the best way to get big, if you don't care about looking unaesthetic while bulking.,Some martial arts revolve around grappling, some on hitting, kicking, chi channeling (lol) and even a few dance based martial arts. They are all rendered obsolete by a little known art that has no name. This art has been considered so lethal it was banned from UFC, MMA and all those other girly pretend fighting sports. It is often taught to soldiers and is widely used in warfare. Like I said, it has no name but the core philosophy of this fighting technique revolves heavily around shooting people in the face.

"This board is for discussion of sports other than the major professional sports.,This includes topics such as skydiving, surfing, skateboarding, rock-climing, bungee-jumping, BMX, and 'extreme' sports of all types. ,Discussions of professional sports teams, leagues and athletes should be posted on /sp/, and discussions of eSports should be posted on /vg/.,Any wing chun practitioners here?,How useful is it, really? Did you get fit from it?,Are there certain things I should be paying attention to when finding a place to teach me? Or misconceptions I should be prepared for?,You won't get ripped or anything, because it specifically relies on conservation of energy when fighting.,It's extremely useful, and even if you don't stick with it, the principles you're taught are extremely useful. Personally I've been very successful in utilizing my Wing Chun training in real life, or even sparring.,If you want to be well rounded, take some Escrima, Silat, and Judo, as they all mix together very well.,Finally watch out for people preaching ""sticky hands"" as the end all be all of training. It's useful, but full contact sparring, or even half-contact sparring is necessary. Finally, don't circle around you're opponent like a twat; keep moving forward and pushing into them; that's the point of Wing Chun.,Any questions?,http://boards.420chan.org/wooo/res/,Oh fuck,He was supposed to follow in his father's footsteps,RIP ;_;,He probably died after a heart attack when his dad gave him back 5$ for gas he had borrowed.,Seriously, what the fuck is smackdown? It was better when they were truly segregated.,Simon Dean Here,I had pretty good seats at this smackdown, worth the 50 bucks,Johnny Curtis must suck some really good dick,I'm thinking about trying parkour. What should I know about it? Is there anything you wish you had known when you started? I'd also love to hear stories from people about particularly awesome practices, times when it was was actually very useful for you, etc.,Pic related, I'd *really* rather avoid that. I'm going to start with just getting used to the warmup exercises and then learning to roll inside on carpet, or on grassy, softer ground.,wear a helmet when you test your limits so that when you eat shit you won't shatter your face,That's actually a pretty great idea. What about pads and such?,anybody? ;~;,Just work out. Parkour will come in time.,a helmet destroys your peripheral. dont use it. always practice with a friend, and systematically increase the sizes of your jumps and difficulty levels if possible. its 70% balls 30% skill.,show me your epic shots, any sport. ill start with a couple.,used to ride for neversummer, 686 and Board Room. Also snowboard general thread, ask me anything.,Sick. I definitely ride a lot more terrain than I do park. Crested Butte is known for its steeps.,Then again I can skateboard park for free.,good ol crusty butt. a good hill when they have good snow. lived there for a few weeks in a motorhome when i was chasing the snow with a gold pass. ,Guaranteed best inbounds day in the state = opening day of the back bowls at vail. guaranteed tits deep almost every year and they tend to do it on a weekday as a sort of local appreciation thing.,Not really, I have a bunch of unedited gopro footy from the past two seasons. I like riding more than worying about documenting it.,It's never a matter of if with injury, it's a matter of when. A helmet is a lot cheaper than having your skull put back together.,we didnt have gopros back then, woulda been nice. i know the injury deal, i lost a third of my buddies every season to blown out knees, tib/fibs, etc. i hate how helmets throw off your balance, even just a little. meh, to each their own.,bump with skihitler,Jousting thread!,lame, based on that terrible show that was on tv it seems more luck based than skill based,I liked that show, fuck you. Also it's not really luck based, it's more like fighting on a boat.,Also Crispin died yesterday ;_;,Old thread hit the bump limit ,Maybe if the place is well-lit, but in my experience most indoor fields have pretty poor lighting.,you go to camp pendleton too? We've got to play some woodball together,Any recommendations on gloves? Fucking, it seems like Empire is the only company that makes gloves and they're shit tier quality.,golf gloves > professional gloves,I like fingerless bike gloves, but BLACKHAWK!, Hatch, Camelback, WileyX, and Oakley all make great gloves. You just have to step out of the ""for paintball"" mentality and look at military gear, too.,Pictured: My favorite set of gloves when I was active duty. I carried a pair at all times.,/asp/ will ultimately be a ultimate frisbee thread,am i right or am i rite,Yes. Yes. Dear god yes.,Why can't people appreciate this is exactly what it's about.,any recommendations on discs?,come on everyone knows that ultimate is all about looking good,discraft 175-ultrastar. get nothing else besides this. I know Inova is coming out with a disc soon, but it will probably suck.,Best sport out there.,sup /asp/,where the ultimate players at?,also how improve my hammer? they always angle back towards the end of flight,I usually just think of throwing a hammer like I throw a football, same kind of motion..,just look up some Brodie Smith videos on youtube... that man is simply a beast!,also, its about fucking time an Ultimate thread was created!,anybody watched the recent ultimate tourney in Japan where the US All Stars went pretty deep on japanese players?!,no this tourney happened like last month.,brodie smith and the rest of USA went ham until the finals when ""Buzz Bullets"" beat them in the finals. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvwI,My hammers used to be terrible. All I can say is just spend a few days practicing those only. I like to bend my body to the left (I'm right-handed) and really focus on snapping that wrist at the end with a tight grip. Hopefully this helps, OP.,Also, in regards to them bending back, just focus on the angle of the disc pre-release. If that doesn't help, just try throwing it a little to the left/right depending on which way it will bend to counteract it.,does /asp/ have any tips for homemade sliding gloves? My landyachtz pair broke, and i don't want to pull money out of my ass for another pair.,I just can't get those coleman slides w/o gloves; it fucks up my hands!,pic related-me and my bitch,when i started listening to OF they were not ""trending."" In fact it was a little before the Radical mix tape was released,odd future have always been garbage except for Bastard and Earl but even those are mediocre,I'm going to stop here and save this for /mu/, but i have to agree their newer stuff isn't as good. Bastard, Earl, and yellowhite are great albums, and wolf is more deep than most of their stuff.,Counter top samples, what type of material, I mean so long as it's sturdy you'll be fine, all my longboaring buddies make their own gloves unless they are on a team or something. ,Anyone longboarding in NYC area?,austin texas,Humans vs. Zombies (also called HvZ for short) is a live-action game predominantly played at US college campuses where players begin as Humans and try to survive in a story where Zombies have begun to rise from the dead. The ultimate goal of the game is for either all Humans to be turned into Zombies, or for the humans to survive a set amount of time. Humans can defend themselves using any item that is approved by a moderator and thereby deemed safe and appropriate, but the most common equipment includes balled up socks, marshmallows, and foam dart guns. With these items, the goal is to hit a Zombie player with a thrown or launched item, thus stunning the Zombie player; Zombies are unarmed and must tag the Humans to gain a kill and, in some cases, avoid ""starvation"", thus forcing them out of the game. Safe zones are established so that players can eat and sleep in safety.,I'd say one in eight players is a girl, by what I saw. Probably more like 1/14.,There's gonna be a Bay Area-wide game starting in I believe April. Search for ""Humans Vs. Zombies (Bay Area)"" on Facebook. What part of the bay area are you in?,You sound about 16.,Holy fucking shitballs, Batman! An HvZ thread!,Heading up to a game tonight to NPC and meet some friends. Going to Penn in a few weeks as well. ,...I am now trying to put names to each post. I've been around for awhile and met a lot of people.,Fuck me, this sounds cool: whats the scene like in the UK? Other question is; how do you know who is a zombie and who isn't - moreover, how do you know who's playing and who isn't?,Not sure what it's like in the UK, the main website has a map showing all registered games I think. Zombies wear a headband and humans wear one around their upper arm (or upper leg in some games),Because after awhile all the WWE threads are getting tiring. Alternative Wrestling general.,Calm down, don't worry. This thread is about the other types of wrestling- Folkstyle, Freestyle, Greco-Roman- all that jazz! It's hard, but fun!,More info, basic moves, other stuff-,http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Folkst,Wrestling clubs help with that shit.,You can also just google essential moves- they show you stuff. ,Setting up a shot is just about making the arms useless/catching him off guard. This is why you see people grab the wrists- they do it so they can't use their arms to protect from the shot.,Also bamp.,Folk style in highschool,Weight class? 145ish? I don't even remember what they were, but I was in that range.,Age started wrestling? Freshman year,Favorite move? Crucifix, Cradle, Toe rides,Any memorable matches?,-I'm from one of those families known for the sport they're all good at, but my dad was the artist who went to college among a bunch of redneck deerhunters. Beat my cousin who had been wrestling since he could walk in the last couple seconds.,-Pinned a guy who still had a leg ride in on me, twisted him around me so hard he started bleeding internally, felt bad but awesome story.,-Caused three arm injuries out of 3 matches one day by sheer coincidence, my Lit teacher was announcing and we were doing Beowulf that week. Guess what my new nickname was.,-Had a moment of inspiration in a match and leapt clean over a kid to put him into a sort of flying crucifix. My entire team stood up and screamed ""NACHOOOOOOO"" when the ref lifted my hand.,How good were/are you? Kinda shit at first, but I was flexible and had some tricks. Ended my Senior year with only 3 losses, 2 of which were to the same guy, but I got pretty sick the week before Districts and couldn't make it.,Record? Not sure, was about 50% wins freshman year, improved until I got to only 3 losses as stated above.,flying curifix haha thats brilliant ,one time this guy had the weird on one knee stance almost like a three point stance and i did a 180 forward roll over his back and dropped into a single leg shit was so cash,Anybody in senegalese folk wrestling?,Or Georgian forl wrestling?,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3Hp,Tis a shame, because Greco-Roman looks like fun on a bun.,You know.... this doesn't actually look that bad,Is that Cody Rhodes witha pornstache?,Yes, and it's over as fuck,Can't say the same for poor Cody,he reinvents himself with success all the time. just that sandow is really awesome too. ,Cant remember the last time he did a cartwheel though.,Good one.,Is that it?,Shit. It makes sense.,Need to know peoples opinions on this,The difference between a tap and a break is a matter of just a little bit more effort. I doubt that you guys practice actively snapping each others limbs, and likely train to submission, whch is excatly how BJJ and Jiu-Jitsu generally train.,Wing chun was here,,Well I guess your disarming techniques are cool.,we train them with a jerking motion, not an easing one, we just don't pull as hard as we can.,if we are stomping someones head in we will stop just before contact or just tap them with the strength of a jab or so.,accidental injuries have happened.,I'm recovering from a finger that was slammed jammed against the floor during rolls, I can understand that much. ,So, you're saying you do the technique fluidly, with speed? We do that too.,Wouldn't that teach you to hesitate before stamping someone's face in?,nah, the fight is already won at that point, a follow through is no problem at all.","Welcome to /asp/ - Alternative Sports.,Wing Chun,Wrestling General [Smackdown is Tonight Edition],Paintball General,HVZ General,Alternative Wrestling,Wrestlemania 29,Krav Maga Thread","03/18/13(Mon)02:52,03/29/13(Fri)14:40,03/29/13(Fri)20:43,03/29/13(Fri)20:23,03/29/13(Fri)20:26,03/29/13(Fri)20:43,03/29/13(Fri)05:07,03/29/13(Fri)20:38,03/29/13(Fri)20:38,03/29/13(Fri)20:40,03/29/13(Fri)20:41,03/29/13(Fri)20:42,03/29/13(Fri)19:20,03/29/13(Fri)19:40,03/29/13(Fri)19:43,03/29/13(Fri)19:54,03/29/13(Fri)20:28,03/29/13(Fri)20:42,03/29/13(Fri)19:23,03/29/13(Fri)20:10,03/29/13(Fri)20:12,03/29/13(Fri)20:13,03/29/13(Fri)20:17,03/29/13(Fri)20:38,03/29/13(Fri)20:05,03/29/13(Fri)20:18,03/29/13(Fri)20:31,03/29/13(Fri)17:55,03/29/13(Fri)18:40,03/29/13(Fri)19:56,03/29/13(Fri)20:15,03/29/13(Fri)20:21,03/29/13(Fri)20:31,03/27/13(Wed)14:14,03/27/13(Wed)20:41,03/27/13(Wed)21:07,03/27/13(Wed)21:13,03/29/13(Fri)20:29,03/29/13(Fri)20:30,03/29/13(Fri)12:30,03/29/13(Fri)17:06,03/29/13(Fri)17:09,03/29/13(Fri)20:01,03/29/13(Fri)20:27,03/29/13(Fri)20:28,03/29/13(Fri)15:16,03/29/13(Fri)18:43,03/29/13(Fri)18:49,03/29/13(Fri)18:51,03/29/13(Fri)19:13,03/29/13(Fri)20:27,03/27/13(Wed)10:56,03/29/13(Fri)12:24,03/29/13(Fri)12:36,03/29/13(Fri)13:36,03/29/13(Fri)19:02,03/29/13(Fri)20:26,03/27/13(Wed)22:35,03/29/13(Fri)01:28,03/29/13(Fri)09:45,03/29/13(Fri)17:55,03/29/13(Fri)19:25,03/29/13(Fri)20:24,03/27/13(Wed)14:12,03/28/13(Thu)22:32,03/28/13(Thu)22:33,03/28/13(Thu)22:38,03/28/13(Thu)22:43,03/28/13(Thu)22:58,03/28/13(Thu)23:54,03/29/13(Fri)19:10,03/29/13(Fri)19:24,03/29/13(Fri)19:24,03/29/13(Fri)19:32,03/29/13(Fri)20:22","Anonymous,Wing Chun,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Carter,The Internet , ,03/29/13(Fri)05:07 ,Carter,The Internet,!!GJY1FUx1QHe,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Vincent Gayda McMeter , ,03/29/13(Fri)20:42 ,Vincent Gayda McMeter,!!UYVhB1c0DF5,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Paintball General,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,noko,noko,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,HVZ General,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Alternative Wrestling,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Wrestlemania 29,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Krav Maga Thread,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous"

If that doesn't help, just try throwing it a little to the left/right depending on which way it will bend to counteract it.,does /asp/ have any tips for homemade sliding gloves? My landyachtz pair broke, and i don't want to pull money out of my ass for another pair.,I just can't get those coleman slides w/o gloves; it fucks up my hands!,pic related-me and my bitch,when i started listening to OF they were not ""trending."" In fact it was a little before the Radical mix tape was released,odd future have always been garbage except for Bastard and Earl but even those are mediocre,I'm going to stop here and save this for /mu/, but i have to agree their newer stuff isn't as good. Bastard, Earl, and yellowhite are great albums, and wolf is more deep than most of their stuff.,Counter top samples, what type of material, I mean so long as it's sturdy you'll be fine, all my longboaring buddies make their own gloves unless they are on a team or something. ,Anyone longboarding in NYC area?,austin texas,Humans vs. Zombies (also called HvZ for short) is a live-action game predominantly played at US college campuses where players begin as Humans and try to survive in a story where Zombies have begun to rise from the dead. The ultimate goal of the game is for either all Humans to be turned into Zombies, or for the humans to survive a set amount of time. Humans can defend themselves using any item that is approved by a moderator and thereby deemed safe and appropriate, but the most common equipment includes balled up socks, marshmallows, and foam dart guns. With these items, the goal is to hit a Zombie player with a thrown or launched item, thus stunning the Zombie player; Zombies are unarmed and must tag the Humans to gain a kill and, in some cases, avoid ""starvation"", thus forcing them out of the game. Safe zones are established so that players can eat and sleep in safety.,I'd say one in eight players is a girl, by what I saw. Probably more like 1/14.,There's gonna be a Bay Area-wide game starting in I believe April. Search for ""Humans Vs. Zombies (Bay Area)"" on Facebook. What part of the bay area are you in?,You sound about 16.,Holy fucking shitballs, Batman! An HvZ thread!,Heading up to a game tonight to NPC and meet some friends. Going to Penn in a few weeks as well. ,...I am now trying to put names to each post. I've been around for awhile and met a lot of people.,Fuck me, this sounds cool: whats the scene like in the UK? Other question is; how do you know who is a zombie and who isn't - moreover, how do you know who's playing and who isn't?,Not sure what it's like in the UK, the main website has a map showing all registered games I think. Zombies wear a headband and humans wear one around their upper arm (or upper leg in some games),Because after awhile all the WWE threads are getting tiring. Alternative Wrestling general.,Calm down, don't worry. This thread is about the other types of wrestling- Folkstyle, Freestyle, Greco-Roman- all that jazz! It's hard, but fun!,More info, basic moves, other stuff-,http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Folkst,Wrestling clubs help with that shit.,You can also just google essential moves- they show you stuff. ,Setting up a shot is just about making the arms useless/catching him off guard. This is why you see people grab the wrists- they do it so they can't use their arms to protect from the shot.,Also bamp.,Folk style in highschool,Weight class? 145ish? I don't even remember what they were, but I was in that range.,Age started wrestling? Freshman year,Favorite move? Crucifix, Cradle, Toe rides,Any memorable matches?,-I'm from one of those families known for the sport they're all good at, but my dad was the artist who went to college among a bunch of redneck deerhunters. Beat my cousin who had been wrestling since he could walk in the last couple seconds.,-Pinned a guy who still had a leg ride in on me, twisted him around me so hard he started bleeding internally, felt bad but awesome story.,-Caused three arm injuries out of 3 matches one day by sheer coincidence, my Lit teacher was announcing and we were doing Beowulf that week. Guess what my new nickname was.,-Had a moment of inspiration in a match and leapt clean over a kid to put him into a sort of flying crucifix. My entire team stood up and screamed ""NACHOOOOOOO"" when the ref lifted my hand.,How good were/are you? Kinda shit at first, but I was flexible and had some tricks. Ended my Senior year with only 3 losses, 2 of which were to the same guy, but I got pretty sick the week before Districts and couldn't make it.,Record? Not sure, was about 50% wins freshman year, improved until I got to only 3 losses as stated above.,flying curifix haha thats brilliant ,one time this guy had the weird on one knee stance almost like a three point stance and i did a 180 forward roll over his back and dropped into a single leg shit was so cash,Anybody in senegalese folk wrestling?,Or Georgian forl wrestling?,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3Hp,Tis a shame, because Greco-Roman looks like fun on a bun.,You know.... this doesn't actually look that bad,Is that Cody Rhodes witha pornstache?,Yes, and it's over as fuck,Can't say the same for poor Cody,he reinvents himself with success all the time. just that sandow is really awesome too. ,Cant remember the last time he did a cartwheel though.,Good one.,Is that it?,Shit.

"This board is for discussion of sports other than the major professional sports.,This includes topics such as skydiving, surfing, skateboarding, rock-climing, bungee-jumping, BMX, and 'extreme' sports of all types. ,Discussions of professional sports teams, leagues and athletes should be posted on /sp/, and discussions of eSports should be posted on /vg/.,Any wing chun practitioners here?,How useful is it, really? Did you get fit from it?,Are there certain things I should be paying attention to when finding a place to teach me? Or misconceptions I should be prepared for?,You won't get ripped or anything, because it specifically relies on conservation of energy when fighting.,It's extremely useful, and even if you don't stick with it, the principles you're taught are extremely useful. Personally I've been very successful in utilizing my Wing Chun training in real life, or even sparring.,If you want to be well rounded, take some Escrima, Silat, and Judo, as they all mix together very well.,Finally watch out for people preaching ""sticky hands"" as the end all be all of training. It's useful, but full contact sparring, or even half-contact sparring is necessary. Finally, don't circle around you're opponent like a twat; keep moving forward and pushing into them; that's the point of Wing Chun.,Any questions?,Wow, thanks. Yeah, I'm mainly interested in wing chun for its principles. As for learning - is there something I should look for that will tell me whether the teacher is bullshit or not?,Very often I've encountered teachers for other things who have no idea what they're doing.,I probably won't look into escrima, silat, and judo any time soon because of money restraints but I'll probably get into boxing/kick-boxing. Would this heavily contradict with Wing Chun?,Simon Dean Here,I had pretty good seats at this smackdown, worth the 50 bucks,Johnny Curtis must suck some really good dick,Vince likes him, so he's golden for a few months until Vince gets bored,Bulletball (and Bulletball exXxtreme) General,Are YOU high intensity?,bump,http://boards.420chan.org/wooo/res/,Oh fuck,He was supposed to follow in his father's footsteps,RIP ;_;,He probably died after a heart attack when his dad gave him back 5$ for gas he had borrowed.,I'm thinking about trying parkour. What should I know about it? Is there anything you wish you had known when you started? I'd also love to hear stories from people about particularly awesome practices, times when it was was actually very useful for you, etc.,Pic related, I'd *really* rather avoid that. I'm going to start with just getting used to the warmup exercises and then learning to roll inside on carpet, or on grassy, softer ground.,wear a helmet when you test your limits so that when you eat shit you won't shatter your face,That's actually a pretty great idea. What about pads and such?,anybody? ;~;,Just work out. Parkour will come in time.,a helmet destroys your peripheral. dont use it. always practice with a friend, and systematically increase the sizes of your jumps and difficulty levels if possible. its 70% balls 30% skill.,show me your epic shots, any sport. ill start with a couple.,used to ride for neversummer, 686 and Board Room. Also snowboard general thread, ask me anything.,Sick. I definitely ride a lot more terrain than I do park. Crested Butte is known for its steeps.,Then again I can skateboard park for free.,good ol crusty butt. a good hill when they have good snow. lived there for a few weeks in a motorhome when i was chasing the snow with a gold pass. ,Guaranteed best inbounds day in the state = opening day of the back bowls at vail. guaranteed tits deep almost every year and they tend to do it on a weekday as a sort of local appreciation thing.,Not really, I have a bunch of unedited gopro footy from the past two seasons. I like riding more than worying about documenting it.,It's never a matter of if with injury, it's a matter of when. A helmet is a lot cheaper than having your skull put back together.,we didnt have gopros back then, woulda been nice. i know the injury deal, i lost a third of my buddies every season to blown out knees, tib/fibs, etc. i hate how helmets throw off your balance, even just a little. meh, to each their own.,bump with skihitler,Jousting thread!,lame, based on that terrible show that was on tv it seems more luck based than skill based,I liked that show, fuck you. Also it's not really luck based, it's more like fighting on a boat.,Also Crispin died yesterday ;_;,Old thread hit the bump limit ,Maybe if the place is well-lit, but in my experience most indoor fields have pretty poor lighting.,you go to camp pendleton too? We've got to play some woodball together,Any recommendations on gloves? Fucking, it seems like Empire is the only company that makes gloves and they're shit tier quality.,golf gloves > professional gloves,I like fingerless bike gloves, but BLACKHAWK!, Hatch, Camelback, WileyX, and Oakley all make great gloves. You just have to step out of the ""for paintball"" mentality and look at military gear, too.,Pictured: My favorite set of gloves when I was active duty. I carried a pair at all times.,/asp/ will ultimately be a ultimate frisbee thread,am i right or am i rite,Yes. Yes. Dear god yes.,Why can't people appreciate this is exactly what it's about.,any recommendations on discs?,come on everyone knows that ultimate is all about looking good,discraft 175-ultrastar. get nothing else besides this. I know Inova is coming out with a disc soon, but it will probably suck.,Best sport out there.,sup /asp/,where the ultimate players at?,also how improve my hammer? they always angle back towards the end of flight,I usually just think of throwing a hammer like I throw a football, same kind of motion..,just look up some Brodie Smith videos on youtube... that man is simply a beast!,also, its about fucking time an Ultimate thread was created!,anybody watched the recent ultimate tourney in Japan where the US All Stars went pretty deep on japanese players?!,no this tourney happened like last month.,brodie smith and the rest of USA went ham until the finals when ""Buzz Bullets"" beat them in the finals. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvwI,My hammers used to be terrible. All I can say is just spend a few days practicing those only. I like to bend my body to the left (I'm right-handed) and really focus on snapping that wrist at the end with a tight grip. Hopefully this helps, OP.,Also, in regards to them bending back, just focus on the angle of the disc pre-release.
