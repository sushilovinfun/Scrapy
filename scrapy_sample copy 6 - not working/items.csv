Or rather that what we got wasn't what it was originally intended to be and was rather a cut down version that came to be because of budget/time constraints or internal issues? ,I mean, there are lots of things that point to this; especially when you look at the 10 and 15 minute demos vs what we got. In those demos everything seemed much more open; a series of islands connected by skylines. Ai interaction seemed different; with the ability to threaten NPC's and to avoid confrontations by staying incognito. Or the ability of the NPC's to summon in Zeppelins for you to take down,or the way in which Liz seemed to interact with a lot more stuff, or how songbird and the heavy hitters played a larger part. Or the biggest thing; the way the ending was presented. ,Am I the only one who feels like they can see the cracks in the game, where things didn't get done or didn't get done as much as they wanted them too?,40 posts omitted,(2 have images),View Thread,40 posts and 2 image replies omitted.
