"Featured,In the Hood"," ,by Cat Agonis,Some things yous can’t escape. That’s what I’ve learned about it all. I can’t escape bein a man. I get jealous and tight sometimes. Specially at work in front of the boys, if someone challenges me… And yous know how it is wit a dame. Some things yous can’t escape and that’s what I know.,I grew up in College Point. My family clan is from there. We’re Irish-Italian. I got pushed out to Maspeth to oversee a branch of pop’s plumbin business cause the Dooleys expand like that. Been in Maspeth since I was 19. Been in Maspeth for 15 years. It’s Queens–it’s where I’m from it’s who I am. New York baby.,Maspeth is a nice little place. It’s like yous in a village even though yous in Queens. For those of yous who don’t know Queens, alotta Queens is like that. In Maspeth they string the Christmas lights in December and have funeral homes for the departed. In Maspeth yous meet a cat young and he’ll be ya boy for life. Yous meet a girl young and she’ll be ya girl foreva.,My girl wasn’t my girl foreva though. Maybe that’s cause I actually met her in Forest Hills. Sometimes I take it there, to other parts of Queens. I took it too far in Forest Hills a coupla times and that’s how I ended up both wit my girl and then without her. She’s in Staten Island now wit my daughter and I’m sure to see my daughter every Sunday.,But otherwise I work and hang wit the guys. We talk about the girls we done, the ones we haven’t, the famous ones we never will – ya know, like Angelina Jolies. Just last Saturday I was at my boy Reggie’s. We was all playin beer pong and I can’t explain it. I got this feelin like I knew my life was gonna end…I heard things about the world endin in 2012 and the rapture from movies, like the action ones. I decided to make the most of it and smoke a blunt. Ya know. YOLO.,Now I don’t smoke that much. I’m really just a drinker, so this did my head in a little. I got the cabin fevers people sometimes get when they’re young and they can’t wait to get older, can’t wait to do things. Well I felt I wasn’t doin nuttin.,I thought I’d roll out to this bar we call the biggest little party place in Maspeth. Sometimes there’s hot young dames wearin tube tops, drinkin hard lemonades and whatnot, but this was a bad night. I hopped in my ride all drunk and high, lookin to get outta this town for once. I was too twisted to drive to Manhattan though. That was for sure. Instead I went down Flushing where I sometimes work. They got alotta buildins that need plumbin over there. Buildins for factories and stuffs. I never seen em at night and I doubted much happened ova there but for some reason I drove that way anyways. Outta habit I guess.,On the ride I thought about my life; maybe I could do more, maybe I could do less but ya know what – at least I was workin. All this thinkin made me paranoid and I seen some things that wasn’t there. Ya know, maybe I thought I saw the boys in blue or somethins.,I pulled over and wouldn’t ya know it – in the wall of some buildin was a door to a bar. Holy shit, I says to myself – I didn’t know they had bars round here.,I went inside to take a look, cause ya know – YOLO. There were all sortsa freaks. Guys in girls jeans, girls in boys shirts wit the checkers on em. One girl had her head shaved and then one dame had hair so long she was sittin on it. I took my place and ordered a Bud but they told me they didn’t have Bud so I says, “Give me the next best thing,” and they gave me some PBR. I was like, Ya know what? That’s good enough for me. Pops drank PBR back before the cancer. Back before the nursin home in Rego Park.,So then this dame comes up to me. She wasn’t sloppy like the girls in Maspeth with their stuffs hangin out, but somehow sloppy like she didn’t brush her hair or somethin. She was wearin these huge glasses like she had serious eye problems so I kinda felt bad for her at first. But then she had on some tight shiny shift wit some dude’s shirt all unbuttoned ova it. I was thinkin – Whose shirt is that? Well, she just rolled right up to me like it was nuttin and she goes, “Um, you’re not from around here, are you?”,Who was she talkin to? Me?! I’m a member of the Dooley clan!,“Not from around here?” I says. “What are ya talkin bout I live right up the road. Are yous from round here?”,“Yeah, I live around the corner.”,“But yous grew up here?”,“No. I grew up in Connecticut.”,“But ya from here?”,“Yeah. I just said I live right around the corner.”,Oh man. I was missin somethin.,Next thing I know she’s talkin to me like, What are you doing over here? And What do you do for a living? I get to tellin her bout the plumbin. How I grew up in Queens. How I was high and checkin out this hood…I was lookin for somethin new since I was stoned wit the cabin fevers and boy did I find it: a bar where people take a shot of whiskey and then follow it wit a shot of juice from a freakin picklejar! People got some strange customs in other hoods, let me tell ya.,She starts talkin to me wit some dreamy voice like she high too, sayin things like, “Queens, I never go to Queens,” and “You know I’ve never hooked up with a guy like you before.” She starts tellin me bout this pizza joint round the corner where they put a farm-on-the-table, whateva that means. She says the brick oven is legit. She says it’s the best freakin pizza in New York City. Then she all flirty and surprised like, “You haven’t been there? Everyone knows it though…it’s the best. SO many writeups.” So I says, “You eva go to Rosas in Maspeth? It don’t need no writeups.”,She shot me a snotty look and says, “Um, no.” And I say, “But it’s right there. In Maspeth. It’s like, a mile away. C’mon! Everybody know Rosas!!”,We go back and forth talkin like we know our pizza better than the other, even though we never tried the other or even hearda it – but it don’t matter cause I know I’m right anyways. Then she just starts makin out wit me outta nowheres! She goes, “You wanna go for a walk?” I told her not really. She tells me how there’s another great bar in the area and how there’s a sushi joint open late or somethins and I’m like, “Nah, I don’t need to see any a that uncooked fish stuffs.” Then she says to me, she goes, “I gotta run. You should come pick me up later. But my ex-boyfriend is crashing at mine so you have to wait until he falls asleep to get me. I’ll call you. Take me back to yours and show me Maspeth.”,I was like, WOAH. Okay. That sounds like a plan even though she’s kinda snobby and maybe hasn’t washed her hair in the past coupla days. Maybe I could talk her into startin out in the showa first, rub in some Head n Shoulders and then we take it to the bedroom. I give her my number and didn’t have no other place to go. I figured I’d chill at mine for a hot second while I waited for her to call. It was only a five minute drive anyways.,Needless to say when I got home I was freakin tired. I fell asleep on my couch after smokin a cigarette, drinkin a Coors Light and watchin recaps from the game. I woke up the next day and checked my phone, worried maybe I missed out on showin this dame a good time. Showin her Maspeth, real New York and Rosas. But as it turned out she neva called me anyway. I guess it’s just who we are, ya know?",,"Bushwick,Cat Agonis,Shanon Weltman,Short story,Sunday Read","

"Featured,Pets","Have you always dreamt of adopting a cute little munchkin cat but never got around it? Now it’s easier than ever with ,, a new pet store located on 12 Cypress Ave, you can adopt your kitten right here in Bushwick! ,Pet Superette is a sister store to PS9 Pets on North 9th in Williamsburg and, if you ask us, it’s not just any pet store. Sure, they offer high quality food for your cat, dog, fish, iguana, you name it, and a variety of beds, funny dog outwear, and other pet necessities. Most importantly, however, is that they are really engaged in helping street cats and in cat adoption.,Pet Superette has tw kittens and two adult resident cats who temporarily live in the store and are available for play, foster care or even adoption. Most of the cats are rescues from the Bushwick/Ridgewood area, which is known for a particularly high number of feral cats. I personally brought in Billy Jean, an adorable skinny kitten born in my backyard, who morphed from a scared cat into a leader of kitten mischief in the store. “This morning I came in to the store and it looked like they had a party while we were closed,” laughed Dottie Evans, an employee at the store. Apparently, the kittens managed to rip open a bag of catnip and cat food, and spent the night running around the store, tossing around toys and beds.,In addition to the resident kitties, Pet Superette closely collaborates with a cat rescue organization, , that runs a regular adoption day at Per Superette. , (not Sundays anymore), the organization brings in cats in cages available for adoption or foster care. Members of Kitty Karetakers are present in the store during the adoption day, and they are also very knowledgeable people to consult if you have any questions regarding feral cats living in your backyard or on your block, affordable spay and neuter programs, etc.,As you can imagine, cat rescue and vet services are not exactly cheap. To support this endeavor, you can donate any amount online or in-person at Pet Superette. Additionally, Kitty Karetakers is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit no-kill organization, and the donations are tax-deductable., ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

Music,"Last weekend, we discovered a brand new band, quintet ,. Stone Cold Fox has a young American indie rock sound that’s more than about just partying. Lyrically, every song was crafted beautifully, showing their mature songwriting capabilities. Their set was vibrant, young, nostalgic and reminiscent of the perfect summer NYC night. To my surprise, this Bushwick Music Crush put some much-needed spring fever into my heart. ,Kevin Olken (lead vocalist/guitarist) and Ariel Loh (producer/synth) founded the rock band while attending SUNY Purchase upstate. The duo was later joined by Justin Bright (electric bass/bass synth), Graham Stone (guitar, backup vocals) and David Tedeschi (drums). Kevin Olken has a memorable voice that compliments well with the other bandmates energetic pace. The arrangement and production value are top-quality while still maintaing an organic, unforced feel. Listen to “Stone Cold Fox” by the band above., ,The internet is buzzing with positive feedback for this quintent collab.

Arts and Culture,"Ever heard of Eve Ensler’s play, ,? For those who love the script, missed out on the pop culture phenom, or any of you curious about the inner workings of a woman’s brain, fret not! Bushwick is getting its own dose of pussy power! Led by ,, the, will be presented at , from April 5-7, 2013 and features a cast comprised of seasoned and rookie actresses who interpret the scripts as each woman would - differently.,These inner monologues have been presented a countless number of times, including on the Madison Square Garden stage and a televised production on HBO. The text is beautifully erotic and empowering. Sexual experiences and internal struggles are simultaneously harmonious and jarring. The vagina is put on a pedestal and then scrutinized/adored/questioned. So what’s the reason for another production,?,The onslaught of sexual harassment incidents in Bushwick , motivated Meggie to produce these popular and socially criticized tales. Meggie states that “,is an incredible resource for generating conversations about women’s issues.” She wants to curate engaging discussions about a woman’s experience, and she believes that ,allows for that outlet because “you can engage without using your own words.”,, Meggie invited any and all females to participate. She wanted to open the experience up to the community in hopes that it would provide an outlet for Bushwick women to meet and interact with one another. Part of this community initiative operates on honesty, as each cast member contributes her OWN story to the performances.,All three performances have different casts, totaling 27 edgy and Brooklyn-ified personas. One of the two women performing “My Vagina Was My Village,”,a monologue about a Bosnian rape victim, is a committed career activist for women’s advocacy and health. DiBa, a ,, is incorporating movement into “Reclaiming Cunt” to complement the fluidity of the piece. The woman performing “The Woman Who Liked to Make Vaginas Happy” has participated in two other productions of ,, and is using her role to experiment and challenge herself with a role she customarily would not take. And Meggie’s own mother is performing “I Was There in the Room,” Eve Ensler’s personal monologue about witnessing her grandchild’s birth.,Considering the range in professional performing experience, the cast has integrated warm-up exercises into their rehearsals that work to build on-stage confidence. They are also practicing various acting techniques guided by coaches who are also part of the cast, including members of all-female improv group, The Works. Meggie’s intention when casting the show was “for every woman that was interested in performing to play a role, regardless of her acting experience. A lot of times women are deterred by the competitive nature of auditions or are intimidated by performing on stage. From the beginning, my goal was to foster a supportive community of women that would encourage one another. Activism is at the core of this performance.”",I am interested in immersive experiences of all kinds. Follow me on Twitter @radish10.,"Bushwick,Eve Ensler,Pinebox Rock Shop,The Vagina Monologues","

In the Hood,"I desperately want to say yes to this question, but I really don’t think it’s true for a lot of women. I admire women who are capable of sleeping with someone for the hell of it, but I don’t think it happens as often as the ladies let on. It’s just not cool to say you want to have a relationship with the person you’ve had sex with. If you go there, people will think you’re weak and needy. Ugh!,Well, what if we blame it on biology? I’m sure you’ve heard this before, but let me recap: If the cavewoman had sex and she got pregnant, she’d be stuck with the baby. So she’d only want to f@# a guy she’d want to coerce into helping bring up her brat. Dudes need to fuck a lot of women so they can dominate the tribe. They can’t be that picky or get attached. They need that quantity of pregnant women and offspring to dominate the other dudes. And I’ve got science to back me up. ,Scientific evidence or not, I just don’t think evolution has gotten us past that scenario. I do think there are some women who have evolved past it and we can make them our role models. But for the rest of the ladies, no matter what we in our minds want and act on, we may still feel conflicted in our emotional hot spots after getting it on. Sorry, it sucks. All I’m sayin’ is, sleep with whomever you like, and if you wind up feeling more attached than you expected to, that’s fine. Bear in mind, it may not be something special about the guy – it could just be some leftover cavewoman imprinting. I think we ladies often feel angry because we assume it’s some sort of old person moral judgment that we’re rebelling against. I don’t think you’re being judged; it’s your biology that you’re angry at.,The point I’m making is, ladies, if you get hung up on someone just cause you f*#ked them, don’t make it personal. It’s hormones – they will subside if you don’t keep doing it. And guys, you don’t need to feel so responsible. It’s not you, it’s anybody. Being direct about where everyone is at with the f*#king is key however.,I can see what happened, and I think you can too. She wanted more and likely pretended to you and herself that she wasn’t as interested in having a real boyfriend as she thought. I’m guessing these feelings built up in her – a year and a half is a long time – and when the water boiled, the whistle blew. It’s really no one’s fault; just people not really being honest with themselves and, therefore, with each other. I think you did the right thing, you took her at her word and acted accordingly. You were conscious of how she would feel if you flirted with other women in front of her. And when the accident happened, she jumped to conclusions.,I wish she was able to acknowledge within herself and out loud to you more clearly what she really needed. I also wish there was less of an imbalance between the quantities of available men versus women in this town. And world peace. I wish we could have world peace. And free drinks all Sunday night at every bar in Bushwick. And that I wouldn’t have to spend money to straighten my hair…But, as I was saying, I am left wondering if, after having gotten to know this person over time, you may be relieved in a sense to be unburdened of her. Or are you left completely unscarred by all this, even if you are in the right? I doubt it. I bet you feel bad about what happened, just like I do. And also, she did fulfill some of your needs so I’m sure you will miss her on some level. Are you being honest with yourself about that – you may be hurting a bit too? Who doesn’t want to have someone in their life, besides relatives, who thinks they’re incredible no matter what?,The truth is that guys generally have the upper hand emotionally when it comes to casual sex, so if you don’t want emotional responsibility, the easiest thing to do is to not sleep with one woman regularly. Keep it moving, once a month max, and no long dinners and no cute-next-day-afters, either.","Dr. Lisa, S.P., is a self-proclaimed psychotherapist, artist, performer and comedian.

In the Hood,"Sunday night 19 artists converged in , to compete against one another in a Bob Ross landscape painting takedown.  You may be familiar with the popular , competitions that pit amateur cooks against one another in an attempt to win audience votes and street cred. In the 10 years since its inception, the Takedowns have morphed to include a variety of foods from avocados to cookies! This, however, was the first Takedown that wasn’t culinary, and what better place to host a paint-off than in Bushwick? The Active Space was set up with 19 easels facing the front of the room where repeat episodes of Bob Ross were projected on a screen. Each artist had 1 hour to create their version of a Bob Ross landscape for the chance to win the audience vote and $250 worth of art supplies from Utrecht. That’s a prize worth fighting for.,The Active Space was set up with 19 easels facing the front of the room where repeat episodes of Bob Ross were projected on a screen. Each artist had 1 hour to create their version of a Bob Ross landscape for the chance to win the audience vote and $250 worth of art supplies from Utrecht. While the artists painted away at their landscapes the audience milled around enjoying Sixpoint beers and chili made by host Matt Timms himself. Throughout the night Timms was talkative and actively mingled with the audience encouraging them to drink heavily in preparation for the upcoming auction as the proceeds from the event were going to Meals On Wheels. I asked Timm’s what prompted the shift from culinary to art. He had an energetic response:,As a rule, Takedowns actually have no rules so each artist was free to interpret the painting in their own way. Some went for the literal approach while other artists tended toward the more abstract. When time was up there were traditional landscape paintings of mountains and babbling brooks going head to head with paintings of eyeballs in the sky and an exploding volcano. One artist collaborated with his very young son on a painting that included glitter paint along- side Bob Ross’s face superimposed on a cloud.,Once the artists completed their paintings and the audience cast their ballots it was time for the auction. Timms acting as the exuberant if hilariously inexperienced auctioneer ushered all of the artists to the front of the room and began the bidding. By this time the audience had been drinking for a while and things started to get enjoyably rowdy. Every single painting sold, some of them going for as much as $100 and the auctioneer himself couldn’t help but bid on a few paintings.,The night rounded out with the announcement of Alice Q. Hoang as the the winner of the audience vote and  a $250 gift card  from Utrecht Art Supplies. The event and auction raised $1400 dollars for Meals on Wheels and all in all it was another unique and interesting night in Bushwick. Timm’s summed up the evening  best, “This Takedown is a total experiment and Bushwick is the perfect spot to see if it will succeed or  if it’s a cool idea with legs. I think it is!  I’d love to do more!”  We’ll keep you posted on future Painting Takedowns.",Lives and drinks in Bushwick,"art,bob ross,bushwik,matt timms,painting,takedown","

In the Hood,"Last week we told you the ways ,‘. In our comments section, readers ended up showing some love for its parallel sister train, the J! Though it has a bad rap, the J/M/Z  train line is actually pretty dope- it runs frequently, rarely has back-ups and delays like the L and it spans a lot of territory. While the L train has its selling points, here are quite a few ways the J train totally trumps the L., Do you like it when your train is harder to get into than a Saturday at the Boom Boom Room? –Of course you don’t!! While the J train isn’t exactly a picnic at McCarren Park during rush hour, it  feels like one compared to the L, which is just a straight up sardine-can. You can stand without touching at least 3 undesirable characters, or even (gasp!) grab a seat!, , As commenter Sean pointed out on last week’s article, “One thing I always enjoyed about the J train was cell-service while riding into Manhattan. Always offered the chance to pop off those ‘I’m running late’ texts and simultaneously blame the J” (in real time).  Nuff’ said, Sean. Nuff said. Riding this line frees up some great email-checking time, too., If you live between the Myrtle and Marcy stops, not only do you have the J, you have the M train. During the week, the M brings you to essential spots in Manhattan like the LES, and if you’re about the office kind of life, places like Rockefeller Center. But even if you don’t live off these stops, fret not–you can still catch the M from any of these stations on the exact same platform which is simply grand for those of us who don’t like doing their cardio on subway stairs., The J/M/Z train has a breathtaking ride over the Williamsburg bridge, with views of Manhattan’s east side and all the way down to the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges. It’s a little know benefit of train riding that has yet to make it into a tourist tips guidebook ., Know what friggin sucks? Traveling on a long-ass trip where you missed your layover and then you have to take multiple trains to get home at 1 in the a.m. At least if you live off the J, you can take it direct to the AirTrain to get to & fro to JFK instead of lifting your damn suitcase up and down a bajillion stairs at Broadway Junction. Hopefully you’re going to the JetBlue terminal to enjoy some cocktails and the Boar’s Head kiosk: an O.G. of Bushwick!, The J runs express, and the Z runs even more express. Seriously, L. Get it together.,So what do YOU think? Does the J train trump the L overall? Which line do you prefer?

With the influx of bars in Bushwick’s always-residential streets, there’s been little enforcement with keeping noise levels low, and that’s gotten to many residents.,While the new rule is obviously not going to be too popular with area bars, it will be interesting to see how the policy, which is just advisory unless approved by the State Liquor Authority, plays out going forward.

Awkwafina pretty much takes him to school proving that men aren’t the only rappers who can comment about in a comedic (yet prideful) way about genitals. When the video for My Vag originally dropped, Awkwafina received a bit of flack from those easily offended by someone talking about their vagina in a way that doesn’t compare it to a precious rose of a genital. But then Buzzfeed claimed that she’d “,” and her video was actually picked up by feminist websites The Hairpin and The Frisky.

Arts and Culture,"s ,, there was Williamsburg/Bushwick-based web series ,from creator ,.  The series hilariously captures the exasperation of being a single and lonely hipster in New York, as well as the struggles of financially surviving as a freelancer – all within five-minute webisodes. The show has been compared to the likes of ,, ,, ,, ,, and of course, the inevitable referral to ,. Unlike ,, however, , is from a low-budget show from a man’s point of view, more like two dudes gathering laundry and complaining about how dirty the subway is.,Season one, which first aired in January last year, begins with the end of Rob’s relationship, where he is shoved into the depths of the big New York singles sea. This quote, from the protagonist, sums up the sappy view this sensitive guy has on true love:,“I hate parties. I don’t want to do that. I want to go home, stay at home,” Rob sulks to a friend in episode one. “The other day, together, we baked two pumpkin pies and ate both of them in two days – that’s love.”,We sat down with Hugel himself for an exclusive Q+A.,“I moved here, got into a relationship quickly, a four-five month thing, it ended and I suddenly realized ‘I live here and I don’t have many friends.’ I had friends, but no best buds or a strong community. The harsh reality was ‘I’m lonely.’ And I didn’t want to do the regular and popular thing, like go out a lot and celebrate being single.”,During that period, the Virginia native was freelancing various video production gigs and working retail to earn a living. This left Hugel with a lot of free time on his hands at odd hours while everyone else was working full-time jobs. This explains why Rob, the show’s protagonist, is often left wandering around Williamsburg and even befriends his banker.,Hugel does an extraordinary job of developing Rob’s character in those five-minute episodes, probably because he was that lonely and naive Rob at a previous point in his life. As a viewer, you sympathize with Rob, feel sorry for him and understand his love-hate relationship with New York, all while rooting for him; you want Rob to get over his girlfriend, move on and find a good job and a girl. In short, , is addicting for their sheer relatability, especially since the episodes are so short. They’re almost like vignettes, or days-in-the-life of your single best friend.,The series also does an excellent job of illustrating those self-conscious, lack-of-financial stability moments I’m sure many residents in our neighborhood can relate to, like dealing with that cute girl working for the , asking if you like children.,“How do you guys afford to get brunch every single week,” Rob asks in episode two after being obligated to at least order an orange juice at a restaurant.,“We have jobs,” Rob’s friends respond.,“I have ,. I have multiple video production jobs…They just don’t happen, you know, on a normal time frame,” Rob says.,Hugel said, while , is based on his life, it’s not entirely true. He says the story lines veer off into decisions he wishes he’d made or that will be more interesting for the show. While the show may share many similarities to HBO’s ,, including the setting, Hugel said he is inspired by shows like ,, ,(UK version), and ,Hugel began scripting , in 2010 after taking several improv courses at the , (UCB), and editing and producing ,web series, which is created by , and ,. He began filming the episodes in 2011. However, a year passed before he was able to release them.,“I wanted to do it like TV, where a season gets shot, you edit it, and release it. But it was difficult because the process of filming was slow,” Hugel said. “But it was worth the wait.”,Before Hugel finished filming and editing the entire series, before releasing it on ,, and long before , premiered, he submitted some of the episodes to the , in 2011. The show won the Audience Choice Award.,“I had never done a festival, never shown anything I had made, especially something that was so personal and which I had put so much effort into. Winning inspired me to make more,” Hugel said.,Since its release, , has received more than 4 million views.

He’s also working on another spin-off show, ,The show,was also screened before each episode of , at , Bar in Williamsburg.,Season one ends with Rob joining a singles-cult full of men who live on a secret boat learning to embrace singledom, reminiscent of , ridiculous circle of pickup artists. Will Rob regain his mojo? Will he stop being a vegetarian? Will he win his ex-girlfriend back? You’ll have to keep watching to find out. And, in case you’re wondering whether Hugel is single.

Arts and Culture,"This Saturday’s birth in the art world of Bushwick came by the name of Transfer Gallery opening Alexandra Gorczynski’s debut solo show. The show called Truisms reflects Alexandra’s reflections on the baby making that is happening today between art and technology. Her work brings the two worlds together by applying the raw sensibility of the physical world into the photoshopped digital world. With every piece of work we witnessed this juxtaposition, the same way we witness our dual selves every day we switch back and forth from Facebook to real life.,Alexandra, as a new media folk artist has been exploring  her own personal digital tales. By painting the Aurora desktop image on the wall of the gallery, she brought her own warmth to that digital environment that we live in everyday. As one member of the audience observed, this desktop image is for a lot of people today’s industrial environment. With three paintings based on complimentary colors she brought about the paradox of Wacom being a painting tool but nobody actually painting with or on it. Works with titles like “Vagina.PSD” and “Hippie shit” encapsulated this physical/digital juxtaposition with the title also being the file name, adding a digital layer of story to her work (some pun intended).,For that reason, this exhibition was ideal to the birthing of the Transfer Gallery, which according to its proud “parents” Kelani Nichole and Jereme Mongeon will be exploring the tension of the physicality of bringing new media art in a space. When asked about how they decided to make this gallery happen, Kelani was categorical: “We just wanted to fucking do it.”,Every birth is a laborious process and putting together the show was a difficult procedure, but it all came together in a packed opening with the audience engaging in conversations about the physical and the digital. Some people believed in the distinction between the two, whereas other were of the idea: “It doesn’t have to be one or the other, they are now blending together.” One could observe that with people digitally recording, through Instagram and other imaging apps, their physical art viewing experience is also becoming a part of that conversation.,Whichever your side, Alexandra’s artistic baby making will make you think and see this continuous debate through her own eyes. Literally and figuratively since her eyes are also very present in a lot of works.",An explorer of sorts.

For our local emerging and mid-life choreographers we have a curated 8 show series titled the “The 2Night Show.” These shows are a collective of 4 – 5 choreographers with pieces that range from solo works to group pieces. In total we present 32 – 40 local choreographers per year.,Unfortunately we no longer present on site at Chez, as our capacity restrictions are set at 25, which is not conducive to a very robust event. Instead we present at our sister organization , (CPR) that was originated by our founder Jonah Bokaer with John Jasperse of ,. We do try to work on site in our studio as much as possible by hosting monthly Work in Progress showings for our studio members, open rehearsals when we have a company in residence, and participate in ,.

We work large, with small resources, and are known by many in the Brooklyn dance community, larger New York area, US, and internationally. Currently, we are looking to expand our local impact by creating a formal residency program, developing talent through our studio and presenting programs, and re-engaging in one of our local schools, PS147.,I’m usually too busy making sure all the parts of the show are working to sit down and actually enjoy a performance, however there was a 2Night show curated by Lindsay Clark that comes to mind.

Your journey will be rewarded as it will lead you to the wonderful solo exhibition of , and his bright and colorful, almost monstrous creations. The show is a collection of larger than life fabric constructions that seem to actually leap off their walls and defy their very two-dimensionality. I had the good fortune to experience the lively and unique exhibition during its opening, which coincided with Bushwick Armory Night. As one of a number of other participating galleries in the Bogart building alone, Tim Zercie’s , was a standout exhibition for a night abounding with competition.,When I first confronted the figures, I did not know quite what to make of them. This in and of itself is a good first impression. Completely non-derivative and unexpected, the wondrous works each possess their own personalities that are at first unnerving, yet convey a liveliness and true humanity.  Reminiscent of ,, Zercie’s works also possess a theatricality and whimsy of Mexican , masks with their vivid colors and well-crafted personas. The similarities to these artists, however, end on a surface level. While some are humorous and engaging, others are melancholy, pensive, or even depicted in mid-decapitation. In all instances, Zercie challenges our preconceived notions of character and figurative depiction.,Zercie’s main font of inspiration comes from a fascination with spiritual ritualism, deriving from occult sources such as ,, ,, ,, ,, and ,, tied together through their mystic and magical capabilities. Zercie literally embodies the mystical texts, channeling the demon, spirit, angel or whichever other deity one chooses to relate to, in his creations. The way Zercie personifies these ancient sources is juxtaposed by their contemporary contexts. In our daily lives, where mysticism has been reduced to a palm reader, Tarot cards and the latest episode of ,, how does today’s popular media-driven culture view the symbolic, the magical, or the occult?,The answer to this question is both simple and complicated. Since the rise of , and continuing with artists working today, it often happens that an artwork possesses its own self-fulfilling prophecy. Works that are created in order to question, parody or critique modern cultural normalcy end up becoming an entrenched part of that very culture. (Case in point: VIP cardholders at the Armory Show two weeks ago were sent home with their very own , as souvenirs from contemporary artist ,.) This form of culturally , art is easy to digest and gallery goers “get it.” Even the criticism that it raises tends to make those participating in these culturally specific endeavors feel better about themselves for being a part of the entire contemporary moment. Zercie’s manifestations do not attempt to present something we already know or are familiar with. Unless you are well-versed in the ancient esoteric religious rites, there is no way you are on familiar ground. This uneven territory makes the work immediately easy to dismiss as bizarre or strange. Although I cannot feign my own expertise, or pretend that I am now going to read all of the ancient texts, I am still interested in creating contemporary connections that are drawn based on the timelessness of arcane religion. They say all art history is in flux, waiting to be reinterpreted by each new contemporary audience. Then how is this art, with its underground and seemingly obscured allusions, relevant today?,We might always be in the process of trying to uncover the “universal truths” of existence. In their own way, the esoteric orders on which Zercie’s work is shaped are seeking to derive their own answers to age-old questions, outside of the mainstream of more unified religions. Zercie’s “conjurations,” as he names them, have the ancient quality of mysticism and mystery about them, yet tap into our basic needs of something to venerate, loath or fear. By attaching a face to these instincts, gazing into Zercie’s figures is like looking into a mirror back into ourselves. By stepping away from the contemporaneous worries and concerns that will soon expire with a new season, Zercie creates a more timeless exhibition that can and will resonate with a number of different audiences for, hopefully, years to come.,Caught between a temple and a funhouse, the exhibition is both familiar yet intimidating, grotesque and humorous, causing our preconceived notions of what to expect to dissolve as quickly as we attempt to create them.,A Family Conjuration ","Allison Galgiani is a writer and fine arts professional from Tucson, AZ, and now lives in Bushwick.

"Arts and Culture,People","WAXworks, a strand of the ,, will host a showcase for emerging choreographers at , this Sunday, March 24th. WAX currently does not have a permanent home, but the show must go on!,Denizens of Brooklyn, new and old, are familiar with the words “luxury condos” and what inevitable changes those two words will bring to their respective neighborhoods. WAX is no stranger to this. In 1999, co-founders Marisa Beatty, Brian Brooks, Melissa Rodnon and David Tirosh renovated a one story warehouse in the heart of Williamsburg at 205 North 7th Street – turning the space into a “professional white-box theater.” From September 2000 to October 2004, WAX served as a hub for artists in a not-yet-famous ‘hood where rent was cheap and the streets were mean(er). Offering affordable rehearsal space, a visual arts gallery and a fully equipped theater that could host productions for ANY type of artist, WAX opened its doors to nearly 500 creative minds.,In 2004, the building was sold to developers and WAX was stranded with ideas and equipment and nowhere to go. But instead of closing for good, WAX embarked on what they’re calling “Phase II” and created ,, a series of performance showcases offering new and veteran artists an opportunity to perform on a professional stage. With the help of Triskelion Arts, WAXworks is producing these showcases once a month, from February until June, and can continue with its founding mission.,For a nominal fee, choreographers can present work up to 12-minutes long and receive a half hour tech slot, objective feedback from audience members, and a video of the performance. WAXworks also offers advice on artist statements, press kits and more – part of their “learn-by-doing” method of preparing.,I spoke with ,, one of the choreographers presenting at the March showcase, about her process. Here’s what she had to say…,How did you hear about WAXworks?, From rehearsing at Triskelion. I was renting space and saw it on their bulletin board. I just decided I needed to set a date to make work and follow through., What was the submission process like?, They wanted to know about who you are as a dancer/artist. There was an application form to talk about your work and describe what you would like to show and a small fee. I just gave them all I had and hoped for the best., Where did the moniker “Crooked Mouth” spawn from?, My last name. Campbell is Scottish and apparently means “crooked mouth,” which apparently also means “liar.” I like it because I feel there are so many ideas and different types of movement I want to present as I work on building a body of work. Having a name like “Crooked Mouth” makes me feel free to do that. Like, “Oh you thought I was going to be this type of artist and make this kind of dance, sorry I lied, I’m switching it up again.”,The idea of “lying” in terms of audience and performance is also interesting. Is what the audience sees actually who and what we are at that time? What part of it are we acting? What part of it is personal? I like playing around with it all., What are you hoping to showcase with your choreography for the March 24th showing?, All the things! It’s hard because I want to cram all these ideas I’ve been having over the past few years into the first big thing I’m actually presenting, so I’ve been trying to sift and filter it down to a few things. It’s based on a school dance, which is a pretty basic concept, but also for me, brings to mind a whole slew of emotions: love, fear, regret, desire, insecurity.,It’s also kind of funny. Going to a dance as a kid was a pretty big deal, but in the “big picture” it’s just another day in your life. Looking back, the fondest memory I have of prom or whatever is how awesome my dress was.,The , in “West Side Story” is another inspiration. I’m trying to let the dance idea be the filter for the rollercoaster of emotions I’ve had – and will still go through – while trying to make it sassy and funny. The dancing is athletic and big, but I also want it to be a little raw with some personality shining through. I’m working with a bunch of amazing dancers who have diverse training and work in nightlife., Do you think WAXworks is an important platform for emerging Brooklyn choreographers? Why or why not?, I think so. They’re gracious enough let me to emerge! Just having the opportunity to make and present work is important, and also the opportunity to meet and see some other rad dancers and choreographers too. Being affiliated with a space like Triskelion is also helpful, it’s a great space.",I am interested in immersive experiences of all kinds.

									! ! 10 Fantastic Music Shows This Weekend ! !							",Maria Gotay,,
"Featured,In the Hood","“This is Bushwick, baby – where anything can happen,” exclaims Willie Jr., the main protagonist in ,, the Bushwick-set web series. , is like the Puerto Rican version of ,, where everybody knows your name, but they’re not necessarily happy you came – and they’re not shy about letting you know, either.,The show’s second season, which humorously depicts Bushwick’s Puerto Rican community clinging to its culture and neighborhood in the face of gentrification – or as the show insinuates, the “oncoming yuppie invasion” – premiered on March 19 with a special screening at Bryant Park Hotel in Manhattan. The series, created by Julia Ahumada Grob and Yamin Segal, includes 12 episodes, of which only six have been filmed. A new episode will be released every two weeks through May on the show’s , beginning March 20, with the first two shows already available.,The six to nine-minute episodes chronicle the hijinks of Willie Jr. (,) as he tries to keep his sports bar a float and tries to win back his ex-fiancé from his arch nemesis, Albert. The show also highlights the many recognizable quirky caricatures of Bushwick, represented by the primarily Latino characters, including the bodega CEO, piragua (shaved ice) purveyors, local artists, family drunks, sassy women, local beggars, salsa music lovers, as well as the unwanted “hipsters.”, tackles themes such as unrequited love, family relationships, identity, stardom aspirations, sexuality, hybrid skin colors/cultures, fear of change, rising rents, entrepreneurship, and gentrification, which instigates a well-known divide between the areas “original tenants” and the growing ,. The show is filled with the authentic sounds and looks of Bushwick, funny one-liners, well-developed characters and great establishing shots of the colorful ‘hood we know and love.,Bushwick residents, as well as residents of other gentrified New York boroughs, will quickly see themselves in some of the token characters. Specifically, Bushwick residents will also laugh at inside local jokes, such as the proper way to refer to Bushwick (hint: not, East Williamsburg) or the silliness – or brilliance, depending on which side you’re on – of incorporating yoga in a bar (I’m looking at you ,).,The show does an amusing job of portraying greedy real estate agents selling small cramped apartments to young, non-native New Yorkers with the promise of being close to Williamsburg.,“I’m talking about the L train a block away, the JMZ two blocks away, Brooklyn Bowl, Meatball Shop and Williamsburg bars around the corner,” the creepy agent tells future tenants right before closing the deal by throwing in the ultimate “panty-dropper” – a kegerator. And also right before all three get pelted by eggs thrown by a moo moo-wearing, long-time resident hysterically screaming, “There will be no panty dropping in my back yard! This is Jesus’ house!”,Grob, who also stars as Ceci Rivera in the show, said the show’s target audience is the new generation of Latinos who are educated, identify with hip-hop culture and are between 25 and 40 years old. Segal, the show’s other creator and lead star Navaja, both said that the show is one that all U.S.-born Latinos can relate to, regardless of which ethnicity they represent.,However, , makes many specific cultural references, which if you’re not familiar with Puerto Rican culture (like me) means you will miss most of the jokes. The only one I got was the corny “Fake Anthony” name-calling referencing Puerto Rican-American singer Mark Anthony.,The show also depicts, and potentially reinforces, the divide between the different Latin American cultures in New York by overtly mocking Mexicans and jokingly threatening a Salvadorian in the first episode. “I’m gonna piss on you… I’m a make a road block, and the only people allowed in are Puerto Ricans. So if your flag doesn’t have that one white star—you outta here. You know why it’s white? Because it ain’t Mexican, playa,” [sic] a character tells Edgar, the show’s Salvadorian artist character.,As a self-proclaimed Texican (a Mexican-American hailing from Texas) living in South Williamsburg, one would think I’d easily identify with the target audience. Instead, I felt insulted and was reminded of the negative instances, albeit few, I’ve experienced from Puerto Ricans in New York for being of Mexican descent. I can’t help but wonder whether that’s the Puerto Rican consensus on Mexicans? If so, why?,I also felt as if I had to choose between identifying with either the Puerto Ricans, which are supposed to represent all Latin Americans, or the unwanted hipsters. If I had to choose, I’d probably choose the unwanted hipsters. And, as a hipster viewer, I’d probably also feel insulted with the show’s overt hipster-bashing. I understand these hipsters are bringing unwanted change to the neighborhood for long-time residents, but they’re also doing good things for it too, things that ,strives to chronicle while also keeping the stories of the original residents alive to demonstrate what a great and vibrant neighborhood Bushwick is because of all these mix of characters and cultures.,As Dave Wondrich, , drinks writer, ,: “[At] least the YUTs [Young Urban Tradesmen] are neat and constructive, things the punks and the hippies and the beatniks before them were most assuredly not… Hipsters might be parasites, but at least they leave the host alive.”,As with many new shows filmed in and around Bushwick, , has been described as an alternative to HBO’s ,, which was created by Lena Dunham. While ,, primarily set in Greenpoint and Williamsburg, is criticized for being homogenous and white, at least it doesn’t directly insult particular races or ethnicities. Rather than broadly calling itself a “Latino story” or a show aimed at all Latinos, , should simply call itself a primarily Puerto Rican story aimed at Puerto Ricans. It doesn’t mean non-Puerto Ricans shouldn’t watch, but at least we have a better idea of what to expect.,Nonetheless, I think the show is professionally shot, especially given its minuscule budget, and it has a lot of potential to be turned into a longer series. And it’s always great to have different perspectives represented, especially minority voices. It can only serve to give a more holistic view, and perhaps will encourage other voices to come forth in the future.",,"Bushwick,East WillyB,HBO Girls,hipsters,Julia Ahumada Grob,Puerto Ricans,web series,Yamin Segal","

"Arts and Culture,In the Hood","Just when we thought spring was upon us, another late snow and chilly temperatures make us all want to curl up with a good book and a hot toddy. Before you don your Snuggie and slippers, check out these five art events this week that are sure to heat you up and give you reason to brave the last dreary days of winter in anticipation for warmer days ahead!,With ten years on the New York art scene under his belt, David Kesting has decided to open the doors of his first solo venture, David Kesting Presents, in the heart of Bushwick. Artist , work draws from a myriad of sources, yet all arise from his experience growing up in New York City. Whether confronting issues of safe sex in high school or presenting technicolor depictions of the Twin Towers, Leo’s work is bound together by his love affair with New York City and the trials and tribulations that come from that relationship. As part of the exhibition, Leo will transform a section of gallery into a replica of his studio in the same spirit of other NYC-inspired installations, such as Calus Oldenburg’s , (1961), , (1964), and , (1986-2005). Paying homage to, yet distancing himself from, his predecessors, Leo’s studio installation will allow a conflation of public and private as the artist lets visitors encounter the intimacy involved in the artist’s process. (,), ,Celebrating two very different mediums, , and , will join forces for their first ever collaboration at Interstate Projects. DeYoung’s animated videos alongside Westbrook’s colorful collage aims to transport visitors on an expedition to distant lands, as the title “Diamon Head,” referencing a Hawaiian volcano, would suggest. The concept of transporting oneself through mediation of the senses is fully embraced, making it possible to travel by proxy through depictions of the bizarre and fantastical worlds of DeYoung and Westbrook. (,), ,No matter how prepared you might think you are for a performance at Grace Exhibition Space, somehow there is always something new/shocking/surprising/awesome to discover! This Friday’s performance will surely prove to be no exception with a superb lineup of artists. Whether focusing on the environment, the body and presence, gender and identity, or our urban environment, all four performances are sure to question, provoke and invite dialogue and debate. Rather than us trying to present a synopsis of the performance, make sure to be there on Friday to check it out yourself! As always, Grace Exhibition Space requests a $10 donation for their performances to enable them to continue to provide thoughtful and engaging performance art to the community. (,), ,If you happen to stray from the Bushwick warehouses and find yourselves in the Greenpoint warehouses, get your rock on and visit the opening of Huyn Jung Cho’s , exhibition. She is ”just a small town girl, livin’ in a lonely world” who appropriates found objects, such as discarded mechanical parts and other  industrial materials, combined with rock and roll nostalgia. And yes, writing about this exhibition at the , definitely required the use of some Journey lyrics. , ,If you missed the opening for , show, fret not! This Sunday, AIRPLANE will be bringing the artists in for an evening of experimental music that will compliment his installation on display. According to the AIRPLANE press release, Butler’s installation is “an interactive sculptural instrument that can be played like a piano but projects light onto the wall in an endless variety of patterns and shapes.” This Sunday’s performance is one in a series of events to surround the exhibition, which will include seminars, demonstrations, and other collaborative performances.

									Five Shows That Are Bound to Get You Out of Your Winter Slump							",Allison Galgiani,,
In the Hood,"I got this invite a few weeks ago and could tell right away it was totally up my alley: ,It had my three favorite keywords: art, sex and booze. ,I attended both the opening and the speed dating party. First of all, the art was great and you still have another week to see the show, so head over to Art Helix and check it out. I focused on the artists themselves. Why were all these young, attractive people single? What did they really want in terms of dating and relationships? Would they be interested in any Dr. Lisa advice?,I managed to do a little speed therapy on all the GOOD-LOOKING artists. See if you can identify with one or more of them and you may gain some insight on your own issues. Or maybe you would like to go on a date with one of these talented, attractive artists? If so, say hi to them in the comments!, (Yes, she really does make a living!),More than 10 years. Oy, time makes fools of us all., It’s better than being trapped in a loveless marriage for the sake of children who don’t appreciate you and will never call when you’re old? (I’m assuming.) I prefer being in a steady, exclusive, long-term relationship, but I appreciate the freedom singledom has afforded me., I guess I’m still single because I haven’t found the right person. Or more likely that I choose the wrong people. It can also be extremely difficult to choose someone if there are so many great options. That, or my crippling fear of kittens.,I hadn’t really thought about singledom and dating being competitive before, but I found myself somewhat eyeing up the other artists. After a fleeing moment of “Bitches, it’s ON,” I went back to reality and I remembered there’s no such thing as competitive dating. I also usually don’t mention my work while meeting people, so this was the first time my creative self played a factor in my mingling. And I did meet several really nice people., Lake is a bombshell and said she liked nerdy guys. Lake’s all into ,and ,that kind of stuff. From her reaction I don’t think she realizes how intimidating she is to guys who are not sexually aggressive and competitive. I think it would be good to try to make a less aggressive guy feel powerful by focusing all her energy on him. That way they could both forget what a bombshell she is and observe whether or not they’re enjoying each other’s company., ,7 months., Pretty okay about it. It gives me time to focus on my career and life., I guess finding someone who is at the same point in his life as I am, i.e. a path of work that he’s passionate about. Also, recently moving to a new city from my hometown definitely shakes up established relationships.,It didn’t affect them too much. And while I didn’t meet anyone new that I could date per se, it is always a wonderful experience to expose your art to new viewers. That was my goal, first and foremost., Zachary is new to town. From chatting with Zach, I’d say he’s a charismatic guy and lives with a close friend so I think he has a stable home base, wants to have a good time, and he seems adept at meeting people. I say, “Live it up Zachary. You have plenty of time to settle down.”, ,3 years.,Not sure I generally have feelings about being single. It is more like I have a natural urge to want to share my life with someone; so do most people. Maybe I have instincts about being with someone.,I am a horrible person and I smell. Honestly, I’m not really a dater. I just want something to happen naturally, like puberty. Maybe less awkward than that, if possible.,I didn’t meet anyone romantically. My feelings about dating are the same, I guess. It is just important for one to be true to oneself and the rest will fall into place. It would be nice to be with someone, but I’m not in a rush. I’m thinking about grad school, work, and the rest of my life., While I enjoyed meeting Rebeca, I didn’t feel like she needed me to butt into her business. She was pleased to be in the show, but I was left wondering why she was bothering with a dating website, since she didn’t seem interested in focusing her energy on dating at this point in her life., , 8 months.,Before I came out, I loved being single. I had all the time in the world to work on my artwork during the day and go out at night; it was a routine I got used to. Since moving to NY I’ve decided to really pursue dating because I felt more confident with my sexuality and I didn’t see the point in waiting any longer. Now I do enjoy being single; I am in no rush to be in a relationship. I do keep my eyes peeled and go on many dates because sometimes you just never know if you might hit it off with someone.,I am still single because I fully came out last September. Though I was aware of my sexuality for a while, so it wasn’t a complete transitionary shock. New York has been a great place to explore my sexuality and I feel like I have definitely made up for lost time. I feel more invigorated about life now; being a late bloomer doesn’t bother me at all. At 25, it’s great to be able to say that life feels brand new.,Surprisingly I had a lot of gay men come up, talk to me and decide right there that we should be friends, and I agreed! Double date instead? I’m for it. The show was a fun experience for me. It brought out my inner child, like when you are in grade school and you go to your first dance. I did have some people that I had gone out on dates before come to the show, which definitely said something. Being single brought this experience to me, so being solo and on the hunt definitely has its perks., I’ll say the same thing to Beata as I did to Zachary. Beata is also new to town, plus she’s newly out as a lesbian. She’s a very charming, young lady who just doesn’t seem lonely to me. So live it up Beata! You have plenty of time to settle down., , 3.5 years.,Overall, I feel good about it because it has allowed me to put a lot of my energy into myself first and become successful in NY. In other words, I’ve been solidifying my own foundation and I believe I am now ready for a long-term relationship.,Historically, I have jumped into exclusive relationships quickly and found myself trying to make it work when I knew in my heart that it wasn’t what I wanted. I also believe that I wasn’t living my own life as balanced as I could so I wasn’t attracting partners who were at a place in their life to have a serious relationship either. I have taken the last year to slow down and discover my authentic wants and needs so that I can recognize when it’s a good fit.,I felt shy and a little fearful about it at first, but the group setting put me at ease. I met a lot of great people through participating in the show, including the other artists. I found it fun and it was an awesome alternative to online dating. I felt like it took the pressure off of the idea of reading first impressions because I got to see my potential dates talking with other people besides me and vice versa. Body language tells a lot about a person.,When I talked to Autumn, I got a sense that some of her relationships had a little bit of too much mutual dependency. Some time on her own is necessary for growth so she doesn’t continue a pattern of settling down too quickly. I feel good about Autumn’s future. She said something cool to me: “The more open I am to people I meet, the more open I am period.”, , I think Juan should hook up with Zachary., ,web designer/developer.,3 years.,I’d prefer not to be, but I’m okay with it.,Because I’m very particular about the types of people that I choose to spend my time with.,It was nice to go to an event with other people in the same position as myself. It makes you realize that there are plenty of people who are outgoing enough and also want to be in a relationship. I was a little disappointed that the focus seemed on relationships as opposed to art, largely because I would imagine art is so personal. Putting the artist next to their art would make it difficult to look at without feeling self-conscious. I met many people, and have a date with one person that was kind of off the books. Probably better that way, we’ll see how it goes.,From my conversation with Jordon, I got the feeling that he was very picky about who he spends time with, friends included. I think that Jordon may be a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to finding people he enjoys spending time with. That’s not to say he doesn’t really like people - he spoke glowingly of his friends. I worry that Jordon may have very specific expectations of the women he dates and it will take him a long time to meet “the right person.” Also, when he does, he may be disappointed when he gets to know them if they don’t turn out to be the way he imagined. However, I am super happy that he made a date with someone that he met from the show!, , My entire life., I don’t mind it, though I would rather be in a relationship.,Just haven’t found that perfect partner in crime yet., Made me wonder If I do these things because I want to have a few crazy stories or if I’m lonely? Maybe it’s a bit of both?, I got the impression that Sam is getting laid enough and says he enjoys dating because he “likes talking to strangers and doing different things.” I love his attitude! I think Sam does want a girlfriend, but I got the sense that he needs someone who shares his particular, perhaps somewhat quirky, interests., ,Get yourself to this show at ArtHelix and maybe you can meet one of these happening single folks! Be sure to leave them a note if they’re not at the gallery when you are., ","Dr. Lisa, S.P., is a self-proclaimed psychotherapist, artist, performer and comedian.

"Featured,In the Hood","Aaaaah, the L train. Why do we love it? Well, the answers are obvious! Everyone wants access to easy train transfers, and Union Square is on the line. If you’re like everyone else who lives in Brooklyn and into food and bars, there are a plethora of sweet places to fill up near most every L stop. It’s basically a fashion show, with outfits and makeup worthy of a half-baked red train carpet. It’s also a way to get where you’re going and take in some serious eye candy at the same time. But holdup! The L train isn’t all wine n’ roses either. Ever heard of , ? Let’s all commiserate for a hot second on how trifling this train can be. Damn you, L!, While no train is a walk in the park during the hours of 7:30-9 a.m., the L train is the mecca offender of claustrophobia, forcing you to know what the person next to you had for breakfast or when the last time they showered was. It’s the worst for the Bedford & Lorimer folk where the over-population begins on the platform, and they then have to wait for several trains before hopping on. Sardine-can City, yo., Admit it. You try and take the F or the A as much as possible whenever you have to do a west-side transfer. None of us look forward to avenue-long walk in a tunnel of grim, doom, and silly advertisements for Bravo reality shows. Although that really happy guy who always sings Beatles covers IS a delight. You gotta hand it to him–he makes it all a little better. He really does., Don’t you sometimes wish you could just bypass 3rd Ave and Graham Ave? Can’t the sum total of 8 people who actually use these stops walk literally 3 extra blocks or less to the next nearest subway station?

In the Hood,"Who wouldn’t love good ol’ printed literary journals that give a dose of nostalgia, and make you want to thumb thorough their pages and inhale the smell of the paper. We just got our hands on the debut issue of beautiful biannual ,, created in Brooklyn (largely in Bushwick). Issue #1 featured poetry by Eileen Myles, fiction by Jacob Mercer and visual art by Brett Rees, among others. On March 15, 2013, The Atlas Review opened their submissions process again in preparation for their issue #2. We took this opportunity and talk about the publication with its contributing editor ,., is a biannual print affair publishing essays, fiction, poetry, visual art and interviews. We stand by a unique editorial process that mingles anonymous submissions and solicited material. This enables us to: 1) afford a unique platform for new and/or under-known writers based solely on the quality of their work, and 2) provide a fresh dialog for established writers and artists. To put this in context, our first issue includes work by the legendary Eileen Myles, and an interview with George Saunders, alongside multiple pieces by first-time authors.,The magazine emerged from nothingness into everythingness when founders Natalie Eilbert and Jillian Kuzma longed for a space where readers and writers could escape the limits of prescribed communities. We think it’s working.,Our , handles the basics – word count, file format, etc. Beyond that, the answer is horribly vague: we want well crafted work that offers something new/vital. I can say that our conversations often circle around 1) the strength of individual sentence/line work, 2) compelling forms/structures employed beyond gimmickry, and 3) plots that develop quickly without devolving into familiar tropes. The best way to get a sense of what we’re looking for, though, is to simply grab up an issue from our site.,Ironically, the founders both have professional backgrounds producing e-books, but the choice to create a print journal is not merely a reaction to changing times. Rather, working with print affords us the chance to create a beautiful object, not just a reading experience. Our designer, Jay Demetillo, immaculately lays the pages out (you can get a sense of his work outside the magazine ,) and we’re proud to say the cover is one more example of an anonymous submission., ,Our event coordinator, poet Monica McClure, also runs the monthly Atlas Reading Series in conjunction with the magazine. It happens every second Wednesday at 61 Local in Brooklyn. The series is unique in that it pairs writers with visual artists. These artists (Chris Uphues, Bianca Stone, and many others) interpret the writing, and that interpretation is projected throughout the event. If you want to get a sense of what we’re about, it’s a great way to meet the editors and get a look at the magazine.

"Featured,People","Yes. Rebecca Goyette. If you haven’t seen her work, been jilted and dumbfounded by her refreshing take on being an artist in Bushwick, life, performance art and the ,—then you might be living inside of a seashell. I’ll let the words, the interview, and the motions speak for themselves…., We live in a world that’s in dire straits right now. Sometimes the last thing I want to see is dismal art. Do you think your performances bring a lot more humor into the art world, and where in particular does that come from within you?,Hmm, dismal art…it reminds me of John Baldessari’s piece made in 1971, where he wrote over and over again like a kid getting punished in school would have to write on the chalkboard: “I will not make any more boring art, I will not make any more boring art, I will not make any more boring art.”,To me, boring is dismal. However, I do not set out to make funny art - but by dealing with human sexuality, there is so much raw id and chance for physical comedy. I am usually motivated to explore an area of my mind, libido and preference that I do not understand or get at in real life., Do you believe that Bushwick will play an important role in performance art or act as a new Chelsea?,Well honestly, Bushwick is a great testing/proving ground for new ideas.  The DIY outposts of Bushwick are where many come to get juiced. There are some galleries in Bushwick that participate in the international art market, and some who play to a more local crowd. But in Bushwick, local cannot mean yokel, because of it’s proximity to Chelsea and the art market, so the work does get seen by a big cross section of folks.,The freedom to experiment can help fresh or more off-beat, less market-driven ideas to grow. This is very positive for art. Bushwick can also run the danger of being isolationist, situational or scene-based at times. I think it’s important that there be a fluidity between Bushwick and other areas where art thrives, be it in other parts of New York, or internationally. That’s where my mind is at, at least., Do you feel a sense of community here with other artists in Bushwick or do you generally think artists are islands unto themselves?,Artists are definitely not islands.  My support network of artists includes many in Bushwick, and from all over the place. My studio is in a small warehouse building in Bushwick, full of artists. This is where I have the chance to contemplate not only my own work, but those around me. I get to watch their work grow as well as my own. The proximity to artists I really respect and trust means so much to me., Do you see any differences between the performance art in New York vs the rest of the world?,I see differences in art around the world.  I was doing a project in Greece last summer, and got to know many artists there. There was a seriousness in their demeanor that’s different from New York. Culture definitely shapes us and our beliefs. That is totally fascinating to me.  We are products of our environment as well as unique individuals.,The video I made in Greece, Lobstapus/Lobstapussy will come out soon, and I think people will agree that the Greek men were a bit serious in the lobsta double-dick-speedos and lobsta-claws I provided them with to perform with me., What other artists living currently and from the past do you admire and learn from?,First of all, I learn most from artist friends and through all sorts of studio visits with curators, collectors, gallerists and with my performers and crew. And this is because of the direct connection we have in the present moment. But art history has other juicy lessons. My lobsta porn series draws a lot from surrealism with obvious connections to Salvador Dali. I also have gotten so much from , and his transgressive sensibility, and his use of sploshing, food and dramatic performance. I love thinking about ,, ,, , and , in connection with my practice, as well., If you had a kid and they told you they wanted to be a performance artist when they grow up, would you try to exorcise the demon?,Well why is that a choice between the two? Performance art is an excellent way to exorcise your demons! I just had a lobstapus (lobster/octopus combination) baby and he was born into performance, the cameras were on him from the start! And seriously, performance art’s popularity has to do with how we all “perform” in life to some extent.  Social media itself is so performative.,Also children need to be encouraged to become whatever type of person that they feel passionate about becoming. I was encouraged to be an artist by my parents, and for that I am grateful., You teach workshops in Performance Art at MOMA and I consider you to be one of the best and foremost experts in this medium. You’ve inspired me a lot. I’m curious though, have you seen many performance artists in Bushwick and what impression have they had on you?,Yes, I teach performance art as well as other forms of art-making at MoMA. It’s a wonderful privilege to share these ideas and methods with people in conjunction with viewing the museum collection and exhibitions. My view on art is so influenced by being immersed in this atmosphere. Through working there, I got a chance to meet ,, on of my heros. I was in the midst of preparations for a performance I was leading, which also involved 20 other performers, at ,, and I told her all about it. She passionately exclaimed, “Keep going!  Keep performing!  I salute you, artist does not just mean ‘painter who sits there all day staring at his canvas smoking a cigarette, drinking coffee!’”,I had to laugh, because I still have this weird inner-painter guilt, since I went to RISD for painting…even back then, I was creating performances and videos “on the side” while I struggled with painting. I am now much happier creating sculpture, video and performative works. So I actually have a similar chip on my shoulder as Marina. But I really love my painter friends and painting. I actually can’t help it.

Dan’s extensive cooking experience includes running the kitchen at Fatty Cue at Manhattan, as well helping to start things up at Roberta’s a couple of years ago. “We saw an opportunity to open a restaurant in a much smaller scale in Bushwick; also we felt an absence of this kind of a restaurant,” Dan told us. Although its name sounds like a German immigrant’s cafeteria, the food is very nouveau Brooklyn – soups, salads, a dash of Mediterranean, whole fish, pasta, all served in a friendly, forthright manner. Fritzl’s has a nice selection of wine and beer (only cans and bottles, no drafts unfortunately).,While I enjoyed a kale salad with black radish and tofu dressing ($7), neighbors popped in to take a menu and congratulate the new restaurant on opening. The Zombies played as I cut my crispy lamb, beet and yogurt sandwich($9.50). And after the whole black bass, flaky with a gingery touch of heat, I tried a cinnamony Oregonian vermouth to cleanse the palate.

In the Hood,"The next key ingredient to the ,, and to getting more of what you want, is to expand. When you pour water into a cup, the cup will only hold the amount of water that equals the space available. The same principle holds true in how much you can receive. The key to expanding in the most desirable way is to make your “cup” bigger.,Expanding does not mean spacing out or checking out. It means becoming a bigger person with greater bandwidth and greater ability to receive what you want most in your life. Where is your cup so full that there is no room to hold any more? Expansion is about getting a bigger cup to make room for so much more. It’s also vital to review the contents of your relationships, your systems, your finances, your dreams, your work, your family, your hobbies, your self care, everything, and see what you perhaps want to pour out of your cup…this will help the expansion process. You are big enough to keep making space for it all, and you are also entitled to edit and choose exactly what you create space for. Every moment is a choice.,To Expand: Breathe deeply and feel into the container of your body. Give yourself 30 minutes of constructive inspiration time. Go do something that makes your inner child happy. Keep it simple. Take your inner artist on a date.,Then close your eyes and imagine. What you would like your life to feel like one year in the future? What does it feel like? Turn up the Technicolor on it and really feel into the details of what is happening in your vision. Float yourself into your own vision and see how it feels. Keep the feeling of your vision when you return, and when you are done, find one small thing you can do that replicates the feeling you have from your imagined memory of the future. You have now started the process of expansion. ","Emily Tepper is Ritual Designer & Owner, Bushwick Pilates.","Emily Tepper,ritual to receive,the ritualist","

Despite the fact that many of the galleries were also participating in other events including ,, ,, , and ,, thirty galleries rallied to stay open past their normal business hours to welcome the swarms of visitors who participated in the gallery tour.,Because there is always too much good stuff to see, Katarina Hybenova and Allison Galgiani decided to divide and conquer, choosing some of their favorite shows of the night to share.,566 Johnson Ave.,Brooklyn, NY 11237,Brian Matthew: ,On view until March 31,In a more modest gallery, the large format multi-canvas compositions of , might have overwhelmed the viewer. However, The Active Space provides an ideal outlet for these massive compositions that demand enough space in which to view them. Each composition connects its disparate canvases together through the use of a singular color scheme—i.e. red, yellow and even grisaille—which in turn unifies them thematically in what first appears to be unassociated images. Matthew presents a burning tree, for example, next to a vintage image of nurses at work, and a shadowy depiction of a person descending a staircase below a cowboy herding cattle on a dusty plain. The lack of cohesion between the various images only adds to their intrigue, and allows the viewer to create his or her own connections between them.

(AG), ,66 Knickerbocker Ave,Brooklyn NY 11237,Rachel de Joode: ,On view until March 17, playful exploration of material properties typically associated with sculpture—volume, texture, scale and space—creates both a whimsical and unnerving exhibition. de Joode disrupts our assumptions that clay has a texture (by presenting it as a photograph) and that the base of a sculpture should possess volume (by printing it) causing the viewer to question his or her concepts of what constitutes matter.

Teale juxtaposes the concepts of intimate domestic space with the awesome natural power of water in her quiet, understated freeze-frame quality. It is nearly impossible to differentiate between domestic and environmental landscape, as both the creases of a bed sheet or mists of a waterfall meld into the same abstracted concept. In both instances, whether naturally occurring or manmade, Teale pushes the boundaries of what constitutes environment and causes the view to second-guess ideas of scale and power.

In the Hood,"As an advice columnist, I often read other advice columns for inspiration. ,It’s from Slate.com; the advice columnist there is , or as she calls herself, Dear Prudence. To sum it up if you’re too lazy to go to the link, the letter is from a guy with a condition called  , which is a real condition. The guy with the condition is asking Prudence advice about how to “handle” (ha ha) his situation because every time he gets to where he wants to be, the chicks can’t handle it. They say shit like, “Aww, it’s so cute!” Prudence/Emily advises the guy to meet a woman on a website where he can be upfront about his, um, condition, so he’ll know that the woman is interested in him in spite of his shortcomings (ha! I’m on fire here!). I have to say, I give this guy a lot of credit for reaching out. He’s probably a very cool guy having to have dealt with all that and doesn’t take the ladies for granted.,I think Emily Prudence gave him pretty good advice. The one thing I would have added is something she didn’t address: how to meet and work with women in real life, not on the web. I would encourage him to get to know women who he feels he can trust; to make friends, if you will. He needs to take his time and, once he gets to know them, talk to them directly about his condition before he gets sexually involved with them. I mean, that’s great advice for anyone, under any circumstances, if you can swing it. One night stands are completely out for this guy, though. That’s just asking for trouble and setting him for more trauma when he becomes vulnerable to an unpredictable stranger.,Why do I bring this up? Sure, it makes for a rocking headline, but it also helps to educate all of us on sexual anomalies. This situation should give you some perspective on your own dating difficulties. Guess what? We all have our own brand of them. Even Taylor Swift. (Bullshit! That’s marketing.) You can also find photos of this condition on the web, but you’ll have to look that one up yourself., ,As I requested last week, someone sent in their art. Marty Gordon was the only person to do this! My self-esteem is in the dumper. Doesn’t anyone besides Marty want their art analyzed? Luckily Marty’s work is good stuff.,Judging from what I see of Marty’s work, it’s obvious he’s got a good sense of humor. He’s also got some issue with religion. I’m guessing he was brought up in a strict Catholic family and as he matured he began to see moral hypocrisy and disrespect for science in the church. I think this disappointed and hurt him. I’m also thinking he may be angry about feeling “tricked” as a child by the church and his parents into believing all this mishegas that turned out not to be true. What’s even more hurtful is that the authority figures in his life still believe in all of that morality bullshit. They think Cro-Magnon man walked the earth at the same time as humans, which we know is absolutely not true whatsoever.,I wonder how Marty’s sexuality was affected by his religious upbringing. (I know, I’m really going out on a limb here.) It seems to me that his work has a very self-consciously whitewashed sexuality. A sort of wholesomeness with a wink. I’ll bet Marty’s a romantic guy who still likes to keep a bit of mystery around sex, a private-type guy who is likely fun in the bedroom. I had a thought that he might be homosexual or even bi, since it’s hard to be sure about his sexual preferences from the photos and cartoon bubbles. Even the Marilyn Monroe chick has, for this type of thing, pretty small boobs, which is as far as I can tell a conscious choice to not show typical Kate Upton type boobs. There’s a certain kind of inhibition, I’d say. It could mean respect for women, ie: they’re more than just boobs. Or maybe Marty just feels awkward or indifferent to boobs.,What I appreciate most about Marty, through my perceived assessment of his work, is that he works out his hurt and disappointment about the church through his sense of humor, which is super healthy. Plus, he must have a balanced ego that allows him to maintain an emotional distance from the church and not take any of it personally. I’ll bet creating this work and balancing himself emotionally through it makes the rest of his life much nicer.,I sent this analysis to Marty, so I’ll let you know what I hear back.,Come to this! Friday night, March 15, an improv group, ARTPROV will be doing 6 scenes, each one inspired from a piece of my art work. I present a slide of my work and then they improvise a scene based on that.

And while we explore it, I know y’all are going to forgive my cheesy smile and otherwise ridiculous faces in these photos cause you know modeling in any capacity is hard, especially when you’re already an awkward human being who feels weird about life in general, and then on top of it my boyfriend took these photos of me at 9AM after an altercation with some dudes in a Frito-Lay shipment truck who thought hootin’ and hollerin’ was a good idea.

I won’t even enter a hip lower-grade version of the high-class places that are directly marketed towards me like Urban Outfitters, H&M or Top Shop because a decent in vogue dress at those joints is still running some odd $60, which is way too much for something that’s not an amazing meal with the gals or savings towards a flight somewhere with palm trees.

Mind and Body,"It’s about 11 on a bright and cold Sunday morning. Instead of being cuddled up in my bed in Brooklyn after a boozy Saturday night, I’m in the Upper West Side. I’m out of breath and my adrenaline is pumping. I just finished (gently) poking and slapping women I’ve never met before – and vice versa – careful not to step outside of a red foam rectangle the size of a twin bed.,Sprinkled throughout the white walls are black and white vintage photos of a 40-year-old man, who looks like he’s on vacation with polyester pants, a polo and a fisherman’s hat, fighting off muggers. The phrase “Krav Maga. Saving lives since 1948,” is written above the entrance of the , center on West 100, Street. Tsahi Shemesh, IKM’s USA director and chief instructor, also has us run barefoot around the red and blue padded room. We leap, look and drop, and shoot back up to warm up before we get into the techniques. With about seven other women in yoga pants and painted toenails, I’m learning how to defend myself using the Israeli self-defense method.,Krav Maga, which means “contact combat” in Hebrew, is a noncompetitive self-defense technique based on natural human instinct and is the official self-defense and combat system of the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). The practice, created and continually developed by the Slovak-Israeli soldier Imi Lichtenfeld, combines martial arts, wrestling and boxing techniques for a no-rules combat and prevention system.,“Knowing Krav Maga means having the freedom to be who you are without being afraid,” Shemesh said.,What separates Krav Maga from other forms of self-defense and martial arts is that Krav Maga isn’t a belt system. It’s situation-based, meaning it will teach you to defend yourself in real threat situations, such as an attack from behind or a knife assault. It teaches you how to survive on the streets, where there are no rules, so kicks to the groin, pokes to the eye, or bites to an ear are all perfectly acceptable. The goal is survival.,The method also focuses on mastering the techniques, rather than the size and strength of a person, making it an ideal practice for smaller, weaker and older women, as well as men. Knowing Krav Maga could definitely come in handy in Bushwick where there have been a string of , since December 2012.,“In the real world, you’re not going to be carrying a belt,” Shemesh said. “Krav Maga teaches you to use your body and what you have to get out of a situation as quickly as possible.”,Claire Lacroix-Bouchardie, a 29-year-old French citizen now living in Manhattan for two years, ultimately decided to take Krav Maga classes at IKM after a fifth attack in Paris. The assault happened around 11AM on a Tuesday in the desolate financial district of Paris while she was with her colleague, an American “built like a football player.” The robbers quickly knocked him unconscious first with a surprise attack, and then pushed Lacroix-Bouchardie against the wall with her head down until she released her purse.,“The first four [assaults] I felt like a victim, like I was in an inferior position, but the fifth time I was angry. It had to stop because the next time I might end up in the hospital,” Lacroix-Bouchardie said. Although she feels safer in New York than in Paris, she still decided to take the classes.,“After four classes, I feel more confident because I feel empowered to do something,” she said.,Similarly, Lina Gonzalez, a 25-year-old Brooklyn resident, has been taking Krav Maga at the , in Tribeca for nearly a year and a half. Gonzalez, who now lives in Kensington, said she decided to take the classes because there were a string of muggings and shootings in her previous neighborhood of Lefferts Gardens.,“I no longer felt safe coming home at night – the threat of something happening felt very real to me,” she said. “Luckily, a friend who had taken Krav Maga had recommended it to me and after doing some research, it seemed to be the most effective, practical and quick form of self defense to learn.”,Patrick Lockton, Director of the Krav Maga Institute NYC in Tribeca, said Krav Maga teaches people to use common sense and objects they already have with them, like their voice, keys or handbags. It also teaches people to be aware of their surroundings.,“We teach a lot about distances and prevention. Rather than waiting to be attacked, if you can get away from a situation, it’s better than having to deal with one. Prevention is a really important part of what we do,” Lockton said.,A positive side effect of learning Krav Maga, Lockton added, is that his students not only feel confident in dangerous situations, but also in social situations.,“It depends how often you come in, but generally we can turn someone around from a complete novice to someone competent and confident to take care of themselves in six months,” Lockton said. “Even after two weeks of taking classes, people start to feel more confident.”,To learn more about Krav Maga for adult and kid courses please contact the following centers:, ",,"bushwick street safety,krav maga,self-defense","

Arts and Culture,"Robert Moses was responsible for the displacement of hundreds of thousands of individuals, most notably and cruelly through the development of the Cross-Bronx Expressway. “When you operate in an overbuilt metropolis,” said the powerful city planner Robert Moses, “you have to hack your way with a meat ax.” This infamous quote came to symbolize the excess of a top-down approach to city development.,In 2005, after the City Council passed a rezoning ordinance, a neighborhood in Brooklyn 6 blocks wide and 17 blocks long became the site of a dramatic real estate boom. Developers were offered 25-year tax abatement to build condominiums. Thus begins , epic personal documentary charting the destruction/reconstruction of the neighborhood where she had lived for 20 years. Her film , opened this week at ,.,Filmed over a number of years, it’s a scathing portrait of one neighborhood’s demolition and transformation.,And capture it she does. The film begins with the filmmaker climbing a flight of stairs, opening a heavy steel door and walking into a vast, but now vacant, floor with gorgeous historic vaulted ceilings. Where she had lived, where she had celebrated her life for the past 20 years. It was where her partner, the painter Cathy Nan Quinlan, started The ‘temporary Museum of Painting (and Drawing), which championed the local art scene. The floor had been completely gutted. Her first words in the film are:,“Oh…Oh my god…they took everything down! Oh, there’s birds!…When we first came here, pigeons lived in here.”,The film is chock full of clips featuring the resident community. There is an elderly lady with her pushcart, another resident working in a garden near the Russian Orthodox Cathedral of the Transfiguration of Our Lord. They seemingly face off with the new, mostly white, affluent condo dwellers. Friedrich finds herself confronting them as she carries her camera to document new development after new development. “I’m allowed to film because you’re on public space,” she insists to one spritely, well-heeled gal who snarls at her for filming. The gal fumbles with her hands full with trendy shopping bags. Soon Friedrich films the infestation of small fancy dogs and sleek granite kitchen counters featured at the condo openings she attends. The entire audience cracks a smile when one realtor after another comments on the use of subway tiles as fashionable accessory.,The film’s genius is in the way Friedrich charts and counts the demolition of the old and the construction of the new. She charts each new development while marking it in red on a map. The rising number of new condos – 60, 61, 62, 63 – underscores that fact that eventually she too will be displaced. And she is. But it’s not without a hilarious scene of her heckling real estate brokers wandering her street below from her window, “Welcome to the neighborhood. You’re ruining it!”,Around 2007/2008, when feelings were running really high, anti-building graffiti began to appear on the fencing around new developments. Across the street from her loft, where an industrial building had been demolished, Friedrich tagged the construction fence with one of her own that reads: ARTISTS USED TO LIVE HERE,Much of the justification for demolishing was based on developers claims that there was no longer any industry left in Williamsburg. Friedrich’s film does a good job dispelling this notion as she walks in and out over the course of the film in an attempt to document thriving businesses hard at work. We grow fond of these businesses and when their buildings are sold out from under them some, like Friedrich’s local mechanic, are given a month to clear out. She films the local butcher vacating the storefront he had occupied for 38 years. We grow particularly fond of the Forklift Repair Shop located directly across the street from Friedrich and Quinlan’s loft. “Hey Cathy! There it goes!” she yells as the mighty backhoe pulls down the last of the remaining façade.,There is some poetic justice in the fact that it takes a team of construction workers nearly two weeks to remove a huge boulder from the foundation of the Forklift building. Friedrich films the crew struggling to break it up. All hope seems to be placed in the rock’s fate. But it too succumbs to the sweeping change of the neighborhood.,After number 173, Friedrich gives up counting and mapping new resident towers. Where there were once thriving industries, working-class families, and artists, there now stand luxury condos. As the credits roll, Friedrich offers up comments left on Curbed.com, a site devoted to real estate. When Friedrich’s graffiti tag appeared on the site it spawned a slew of anti-artist comments. Here is Friedrich’s favorite:,The last “artist” we had was Picasso. The rest of them should just eat shit and move on.,FYI: ,, reports that last month Bushwick’s residential rent prices leaped by 20 percent. Hey Su can I borrow that camera?

In the Hood,"On a cold Saturday night, a Ridgewood warehouse hosted “the world’s biggest”,. We went to another body painting party at ,; this shindig was called “Abstract” and was hosted by ,, who put on a lot of shows around the area and in Manhattan. What greeted us was a warehouse full of gyrating glow-in-the-dark body parts and bumping house music that pulsed your organs worse than a Motorhead concert. I was obviously in the small minority of painfully sober folks surrounded by a sea of perpetually warm, glowing, ecstasic bodies. Yet there I stood, jostled by hundreds of radioactive individuals, when I realized the draw of these huge dance parties. Here is what I saw:",,"abstract warehouse,body painting party","

People,"A couple of weeks ago a remarkable photography exhibition by , opened at ,. The magical photographs of Chrisostomou may appear heavily Photoshopped but, in fact, the only thing manipulated here is your assumptions.,Chrisostomou photographs ordinary, everyday objects. He photographs them in familiar and unremarkable environments but the notion of scale is disrupted to such a degree that the work becomes surreal. A viewer, jaded by the digitally altered imagery of today, can easily forget how painstaking creations such as these can still prevail. The pleasure in Chrisostomou’s photographs becomes the search for imperfection – the identification of a human creator.,We met Petros in his studio on Bogart Street to talk about how he achieves a strikingly contemporary aesthetic using an almost-antiquated practice., I know from your website that you went to art school in England. What did you study?, I went to St. Martins College where I studied sculpture., Did you seriously study sculpture at St. Martin’s College?, , Yep., Did you have a thirst for knowledge?, , Are we both singing Pulp in our heads?, , Yes! I wasn’t expecting you to say sculpture. Let’s start with that. How has sculpture influenced your photography?, I was really influenced by Richard Serra and Jessica Stockholder. They make these huge freestanding structures. Beautiful pieces. I wanted to make that sort of work but I could never store it. I realized that only through photography could my sculpture work have any permanence. When I needed a space for my sculptures, I decided to build it., , You built your own exhibition space?, Yeah, the miniatures. That’s when I started building miniature sets., Oh my goodness! Okay, I see what you’re saying. Yes, you still are a sculptor. I mean, you’re a photographer, too. But that is sort of secondary to all this, isn’t it?, I build this thing, which is the artwork. Then, I photograph it and , becomes the artwork. It asks new questions in this new form. Which part of this piece is the artwork: the sculpture or the documentation of the sculpture? What remains is the idea of the artwork, not the artwork as it was originally. I enjoy that., Like Christo’s wrapped landscapes?, Yeah. There are countless examples. I agree with Boudrillard’s idea that the simulacrum is not [an inferior] copy of the real, but its own truth. I guess I try to explore these ideas with my work., What happens to the sets once they have been photographed?, The photograph is the end product. I think as an artist you want to control the way the viewer sees the work. In the end the sets are pulled apart. I hang on to bits if I think I can re-use or re-fashion them, but the set disappears., I am just amazed at what you’ve built. They are very detailed architectural models. How long do they take to make?, It depends. These are all at various stages of completion. I could spend a whole day looking for bits and pieces and come back with nothing and that’s a very disappointing day. Sometimes a project can’t continue because of a delay in the process, like if I can’t find a specific piece or can’t make it myself. It can take up to six months to build a set for all those reasons. Moving studio spaces always sets me back as well. Everything has to be disassembled and packed into boxes; it’s a nightmare., I am just so excited by all this. It’s so tactile and playful. These tiny little washing machines! Where do you get all this stuff?, Some things I buy, some things I find and appropriate, and some things I have fabricated. For example, if I go to a doll store they will never have the sort of grimy office furniture I need. But I might go there and be able to appropriate something., , I love the idea of a grown man rummaging around a doll store all day., Oh please. They know me by name. There’s only one in Manhattan, on 77th and 3rd so they know me by now. I know a lot of these things are online, but I want to be able to see things in person to get a sense of color and size., How much is Photoshopped?, None of it. It is traditional photography. Somehow we think we are seeing this fantastical, impossible space. But it’s all there. People have been doing this still life tradition for centuries.  It’s crazy to build all these things; it’s crazy and obsessive. But that gives it meaning. It’s poetic and beautiful. When we live in an age where things are so superficial and artificial it’s even more important to make work this way., Let’s talk about the photography process for a little bit. You have this beautiful large format camera. When did you learn your camera craft?, , I taught myself. I think I’m a terrible photographer. I always use available light, and sometimes I shoot five or six frames just to get the one that I’m happy with. I probably shouldn’t admit that on record., , I think you’re doing okay with five or six to one. Why large format?, It has to do with the size of the images. I always wanted really big prints. I wanted them large enough so that the viewer feels like they are walking into them, but still small enough to feel it as an artwork. I was shooting on 35mm film early on and I had them printed at nearly six feet long, but they were really grainy. I didn’t mind – there is a certain beauty in that – but people started recommending that I focus more on image quality, so I did., What is your routine? What does your work week look like?, My mornings are spent checking my inbox. Time zone differences make things difficult. I work with a gallery in Athens, so they are seven hours behind. I end up working a lot in the evenings and on the weekends. I wish I didn’t have to spend so much time online, but that’s the way it is. Sourcing things is so time-consuming. Communication is a killer, too. Sourcing and quotes, material approval, printing details, all the administration involved is all so time-consuming. But I guess you learn every single aspect of the art world when you have to do it all yourself., Do you enjoy living and working in Bushwick?, I moved to Bushwick two years ago and started to feel comfortable right away. It’s great here. Now that Fuchs has this space I feel like part of a gang. We go to openings together. It’s really made me feel part of something. I was a Greek Cypriot in London, so I feel like I’ve never really had a “clique.” The greatest thing about Bushwick is that people have come here from all over the place., Do you go out in Bushwick?, I would, but I don’t think I’m cool enough. , I like Wreck Room. For me, that place is everything that this neighborhood represents. The Anchored Inn is kind of nice as well., I don’t know the Anchored Inn…, Well we’ll just have to go there some time., Immediately, please, if not sooner!,***,Keep your eye out for interesting things brewing at ,.

Think of the ,’s Garbage Pail Kids crowd meets “The Walking Dead” meets burlesque.,The night will feature performances by Alotta McGriddles, Charmin Ultra, DiBa, Krystal Something-Something, Macy Rodman, Mary Jo CamelToe, Stevie Zar, and Whiskey Dixie – experts in public displays of cultivated craziness.,Bushwick-based performer, DiBa is curating the night with the help of Tandem staffers Will Myrick and Stephen Berg. The Locally Grown performers were chosen because of their ability to craft decisions and show the audience something they want to see, even if they don’t know it yet. These purposeful choices lead to playing with elements that are atypical for a drag show, such as virtuosic dance, video projection and fake blood. “They are making a statement instead of embodying Beyoncé” says DiBa. This statement equals a show where NOTHING is off limits.,Locally Grown is not your average dress-wearing, ballad-lip synching, transformation to Hell’s Kitchen bingo night. No. These performers are extravagant and mean to be. They are purposefully weird, awkwardly comedic, outlandish and vulgar. All the cool verbs. They , you to gawk as they push your comfort boundaries. And the transformation you feel yourself experiencing, well that may be the best part. You might find yourself saying, “Where has this show been all my life?” or simply “OMG!”,The first Locally Grown Drag last month included dub step sandwich-eating, cardboard cats, confetti, quesadilla toasting, Eminem…that’s just to name a few. The set will feature trained dancers from The Ohio State University and University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

Arts and Culture,"‘s madness of an art studio is the exact antithesis of Jason Andrew’s spotless apartment gallery, ,. When visiting him in September of 2012, he told me about being a kid in the midwest and going to all-night coffee shops. There, he and his friends would get hopped up on coffee and buy jelly doughnuts. They’d take the doughnuts to Kinko’s and smear them across the copy machine’s glass to match the speed of the machine’s light. Upon paying for the copies the late night clerk would give them a sly smile – aware of the hijinks they’d wrought and the clean up ahead of him.,That clerk’s intuition for letting these kids play with color has panned out to be a wise one. If only because Ben has followed this direction into the three-dimensional realm with his fantastical sculptures. Sculptures that have dotted the landscape outside Norte Maar in Beat Nite’s and BOS’s past. Recently, he’s revisited the photocopy work by publishing with ,. These series of events led ultimately to the exhibition ,at Norte Maar.,The sculpture , is a 5′ by 5′ by 5′ three-part freestanding behemoth. A behemoth completed in just three weeks. Splashes and lines of a painterly quality are held in by glass on the outermost sides. During the opening, Godward encouraged people to stick their heads inside the gaps in the sculpture to see what he had really done. By my estimate, he has taken his natural tendency to layer, build, coat and enlarge his eye-candy sculptures and whipped them into a sleek and modernist form.,In the kitchen and office area are pieces unlike what we’ve grown accustomed to seeing from the artist. A Mountain Dew can painted and speckled with nail polish sat inside a glass case on a perfectly white shelf. Its title: ,. On the adjacent wall, one of the Fortress To Solitude prints hung of the same can, simply titled ,. This unassuming bit of curation gives a view of the creative process involved in the non-Photoshop assisted prints.,Finally, in the office we encounter more experiments in nail polish. Scratch offs – spent losers at that – are coated in lines that seem to bridge (in miniature) the gap between his sculpture and prints. It’s not merely in passing that I note that the scratch offs are not winners – one title says everything - ,Except, I must disagree. I just won $4 on a scratch off and Ben Godward’s work has gone somewhere new and exciting.,Check out Bushwick Daily interview with Ben ,.,Fortress To Solitude’s Q&A + Ben’s prints ,., is up at Norte Maar until March 24.

Food and Drink,"A little further out and a quick hop to the JMZ line, and the available nightlife starts to expand beyond the typical Brooklyn dive bars. Yes, this part of Bushwick has dive bars aplenty, but there are also dance clubs, concert venues, and refined cocktail bars serving locally sourced grub. Bottom line: you can satisfy pretty much any type of nightlife craving within a five block radius.,Paying homage to the legendary Warhol-approved Greenwich Village café of the same name, , strives to capture a similar artist-friendly vibe, providing both a performance space for musicians, artists, and burlesque dancers and some serious cocktails for serious imbibers. The slightly eerie, offbeat vibe is played up by red lights that cast an unnatural glow into otherwise dark spaces, creepy day-of-the-dead dolls smiling down (or up) from their window perches, and Gothic lamps providing little in the way of illumination and a lot in the way of weird shadows. A full bar ensures your alcohol quota is taken care of, plus there’s a selection of French wine (courtesy of the two French owners) and international beers, including Left Hand Milk Stout ($6). Specialty cocktails are a bit pricey at $13, but with names like the espresso-and-tequila-based Johnny Mad Dog and a heavy pour, they’re well worth it., Lose all your inhibition with an absinthe cocktail like the No. 4, a heady mix of Saint Germain, Pernod, absinthe, grapefruit and champagne ($13).,Another under-the-tracks bar slash restaurant, this warm little spot offers simple yet delicious cocktails and a menu of locally sourced eats, including salads of the day ($9) and bread from Robertas ($1). To create a warm, homey vibe, the décor combines rough wood accents, large chalkboard menus, and stylishly distressed wooden countertops and tables, plus small vases of flowers to provide bursts of color in an otherwise monotone design palette. Formerly Beauty Bar and after that (albeit briefly) Broomies, the owners renovated and gutted the space before launching ,, previously a long-time Smorgasburg booth. Simplicity is still key, with a cocktail list of basics like margaritas and Bloody Mary’s for just $7, or drafts like Empire Amber Ale, 21, Amendment Back in Black, and Dundee Brown Lager for $6., The Late Night Reviver ($9), a mix of gin, Fernet, fresh ginger and lime.,With the latest underground DJs manning the deck and a kickass sound, this tropical-themed dance club has quickly become the spot where young (and not-so-young) Bushwickians shake and shimmy out their weeklong frustrations on the dance floor. A wilder alternative to the standard Bushwick bar scene, ,’s off-the-beaten-path vibe belays the 1960s Miami dance club vibe and energy pulsing out as soon as you walk in the door. Revelers can get down to a mix of house and techno music while sipping on $9 tropical cocktails and $6 thirst-quenching beers. Plan on putting on your dancing shoes for the wild parties on Friday and Saturday nights, and don’t worry about the dress code or cover…there is none. Cash only., Stay hydrated with a $2 cucumber juice or a $6 Pacifico.,This dark little dive bar nestled under the JMZ tracks has everything a good bar needs, from a pinball machine to heavily tattooed bartenders to regularly scheduled burlesque shows. Stylishly lit with candles, its relaxed vibe is enhanced by low-key wood benches dotting the space and a curved bartop at which you’ll find all sorts of people, from a manic-pixie-dream-girl folding origami to a 50-something local looking to take in the new neighborhood nightlife. Like its neighbor Goodbye Blue Monday, ,offers semi-frequent concerts but with a drink list as unpretentious as the illuminated wolf lighting a sign outside the bar, offering thirsty patrons beer, wine, and hard liquor. Plus, every day of the week there’s a $5 PBR and shot special., Stick to the dive bar theme with a $3 Genny can,With eight years under their belt, , is as close to a Bushwick landmark as a DIY venue can get. The coffee shop meets garage meets scrapyard vibe comes from kitschy accents, including a Brooklyn Dodgers bike hanging from the tin ceiling, plastic garden chairs, and slowly disintegrating figurines and antiques. Live bands often pack the place to overflowing, so you’ll be elbow-to-elbow with other music geeks enjoying the $4 plastic cup of house wine and cheap drafts (including Ballantine). Go now, this Bushwick cult staple is struggling to cover improvements needed to maintain the space and have launched an , to raise funds that ends on March 25., Every night from 11pm-midnight, you can get a grilled cheese and pint of Pabst for $5.

									Cool NEW Galleries Not to Miss during Bushwick Armory Night							",Katarina Hybenova,,
Arts and Culture,"Last Saturday night, we visited a new gallery at 17-17 Troutman called , The exhibition, titled ,showcased the work of ,and,, both highlighting the similarities of the artists and juxtaposing them to create a visually compelling dialogue. These layered interactions colored the walls of the literal and figurative white space in Ridgewood, manifesting a well-received exhibition.,The two artists worked in a limbo between the actual and the desired space; between reality and memory, presence and absence. This in-between movement in the themes of both artists created a movement in the exhibition itself. Their work complemented and defined the distance between each other’s work.,Cassie Raihl’s work was composed of five sculptures. Her material-heavy abstraction, as she defined the exhibited works, was focused on physical labor and fetish. As she walked me through her works she pointed out the various materials used; from boxer shorts to cushions and T-shirts, these materials celebrate the absent body. Her white-centered work was mixed with colorful additions of commercial textures.,Whereas Cassie was using found objects, the commercial aspect was manifested through found colors from J. Crew catalogs arranged with colors found in 16th century Iranian documents in JJ’s paintings. Being a keen observer of his world, as he told us, he accesses his curiosity for color and there he finds inspiration. He also becomes an observer of his work during the process and builds on the idea that brought the painting into life. By becoming the viewer and the artist at the same time, parts of his work explain and give away parts of the process.,As we talked with ,, whose work was shown before, she pointed out how the works of the two artists complimented each other spatially and visually, creating a natural fit based on the use of current subjects with commercial aesthetic. We also talked about the effect a gallery like Harbor has on the artistic community of Bushwick. According to Magali, the gallery is part of a larger equation that brings new artists together and, by opening their space for emerging artists to show their work, they become part of a broader network of people.,The 17-17 Troutman building, the home of several DIY galleries organized by artist collectives, was filled with people last Saturday. People moved around the galleries, viewed new works of art, supported the cultural production of an area and captured a moment in time of a neighborhood that finds inspiration in people coming together, exchanging ideas and, through their co-existence, creating something new., ",An explorer of sorts.

Fashion & Shopping,"Spring is around the corner, and if that isn’t enough to make you excited to get outside again then learning about a new custom bicycle studio in Bushwick should. AJ Nichols opened , last September and has been providing the neighborhood with awesome custom-made bikes ever since.,One wouldn’t think to look for a bicycle studio in a basement, but customers soon forget they’re underground when they see the studio for the first time. Zeppelin playing in the background, a Brooklyn lager in hand and conversation that feels like you’re talking to an old friend can make anyone feel right at home.,Nichols knows his bikes. He’s been restoring, repairing and transforming them into impeccable works of art since he was 16. As a first-time business owner, he’s excited to get his shop off the ground.,“Buying a bike in New York on Craigslist is kind of a gauntlet,” Nichols explains. His studio cuts out the middleman and gives people a more personal experience when it comes to choosing the perfect bike for them. When he’s not teaching bike mechanics at ,, Nichols is in his shop fixing up antique and vintage bikes or searching for his next big find.,“I’ve streamlined the whole process,” he says. “I buy the bikes out of state, tear them down and turn old 70s and 80s ten speeds into affordable road bikes.” Nichols provides a ride for the average customer looking to get around town, but he also specializes in restoring pre-war antiques, ’60s muscle bikes and ’50s Schwinn’s for collectors.,Most of the bikes turned into commuters are from out of state, but Nichols works with clients who have custom orders or are looking to trade in their old bike for something new. “That’s how it all started because I knew there was a demand for affordable, high-quality bikes,” he says. “People want something they can lock outside for a few hours and it’s not a thief magnet.”,As for the collectibles, he meticulously strips them of the current paint job to expose the original patina. A few antiques are from the pre-war era and would look amazing in anyone’s home or rolling down the street.,Customers who stop by can’t help but notice the antiques, and a penny-farthing from the 1800s sticks out as it sits against a wall. “Everything was made by hand by a blacksmith so there aren’t any replacement parts,” Nichols says about his crazy find. “If it takes years to restore and sell and I have to look at it everyday I’m ok with that.”,Nichols works hard to ensure that his clients leave with a bike that fits them and their needs, and also offers general repairs and tune-ups. “Bike shops don’t do old school service options anymore and that’s horrible,” he says. “I have a lot of pride in knowing I can take a bike out of the trash and make it awesome.”,Nichols has big plans for his studio and hopes to expand in the future. A nostalgic-feeling retail space filled with vintage bikes and a top-notch service station is a lofty goal, but may not be as far away as he thinks.,“It’s a simple concept to try and sell quality stuff that was made to last,” he says. “If it’s been around for twenty or thirty years and it’s still rolling, it’s going to last another twenty or thirty.”","Native Texan, writer and aspiring rock star.

Arts and Culture,"Place 60 artists and hackers over a strong God-inspired fire. Boil frantically for 72 hours. Serve in party mode for only one night in 27 distinct servings. The second iteration of , in Bushwick took place last Saturday at , and looked like a recipe made for the modern technological age.,This year’s theme, “God Mode,” has been an interesting feature in video games since the 1980s, but has also recently migrated to our ever-expanding digital lives. In the gaming world, God Mode grants players unlimited strength, seconds of invulnerability or access to previously unreachable areas; in everyday life, God Mode is materialized in the constant surveillance of our electronic devices.,By exploring this theme, the projects created an experience that resembled an acid trip of flashy imagined worlds, dystopian futures and religious omnipotence all at once. Projects were simultaneously funny and grotesque, poignant yet playful.,In the basement, one of the projects taught us how to avoid DNA collection by the authorities, inspired by Gataca. Though low on technological complexity, it gave us a glimpse of a world where science fiction is becoming reality.,On the other side of the basement, the creators of , allowed people to digitally create or destroy land, inspired by,. A simple concept, yet technically complex, the project will have the potential to evolve outside of Art Hack Day.,On one of the walls on the main floor, there was a computer installation that offered people a chance to explore and surf the web in the company of Jesus. , was a simple idea that let the user make what s/he wanted of it, even if that meant watching gay porn, for example. In whatever way s/he chose to use it, Jesus was acting like a hacker intercepting the information.,A gaming app called , involved a designated God/user and his subjects that provided him/her with their video feeds. As the different devices were connected, points were accumulated, towards talking to God or achieving Godhood. The creators of the app are planning on getting the app to the iTunes store, bringing us closer to their version of the gamified Big Brother.,As I left the this modern-day technological circus, I could see why this event takes place in Bushwick. The face of this neighborhood is formed by the technological advances that are happening around us. Automation and robotics have rendered traditional manufacturing obsolete, leaving us with giant warehouses and buildings that now host artists, programmers, engineers and designers who further our thinking and approach to an obscure future, where technology will be omnipresent in every move we make.,For an extended view of the projects, check out the , on the Art Hack Day website and make sure to check out the , space for more interesting events in the future., ",An explorer of sorts.

So between , and studying her paintings I came up with this assessment:,Another artist whose work has a very different psychological voice is ,. The nature of her work is directly sexual and attention grabbing. Rebecca’s work seems to use lobsters as a metaphor for human sexuality. She writes in her artist’s statement, “Performance, sculpture, sound, and image come together in the form of video.” She also uses only untrained performers dressed in her sculptural sexy lobster costumes in her videos. Here’s my psychological take on Rebecca’s work:,What’s great about these two artists is you can see how creating art is helping them develop as people. Art is a great way to exorcize your demons. I think that’s a significant reason why people feel inspired by viewing art; you can sense the quality of human development baked into the work.","Dr. Lisa, S.P., is a self-proclaimed psychotherapist, artist, performer and comedian.

Their sound is hard to define, even when their songs are slowly being unwound before an audience. Their music is characterized by layers of breathy, jazzy vocals that quiver in heartfelt harmonies and cascading rounds. These heavenly coos ring atop succinct psychedelic guitar reverb and spacey synthesizer riffs, lead by captivating and powerful drums, arrive at the point of awesome.,The point, in this case, is pleasantly confusing. Sometimes it’s an eruptingly loud climax, other times it’s the softest whimper of a guitar, calm vocals and scattered muted beats. While you drift back and forth, you’ll be overcome with the variety of influences that stretch each song - jazz, pop, experimental, funk, rock. Switching your body’s rhythm to adapt to a nostalgic atmospheric intro that will soon transform into jazzy and hypnotizing interlude (“Hold Your Tongue”), you’ll realize there’s a lot more to this band than the Brooklyn Indie title they’ve started to earn. No wonder they list ,, ,, and ,as influences on their ,.,There’s definitely something satisfying about not knowing where a band’s sound will take you. Too often, debut albums wind in a circle that seems enticing at first but never takes off beyond a few jangy chords.

Arts and Culture,"Bushwick residents seem hip to the idea of making art for the community. Festivals like , provide audiences with a peek inside the studio doors of local artists. But what about people living in Bushwick day in and day out? What do they see? The sidewalks, buildings and street fashion can be enough stimulation in and of itself, but why is Bushwick being compared to Manhattan gallery communities? After attending the opening for “Spun O Lith” at , on Friday night, I find myself asking whether or not Bushwick artists make art specifically for Bushwick artists.,Rebecca Gaffney, lead curator for ,, is a Brooklyn-based video and installation artist who works with out-of-phase strobe light and reflections of performers in live camera feedback. She likes to improvise with light, music and sound. And Spun O Lith was just that – the improvising of visual materials within a space.,But what does that improvisation do for the viewer? Do we hope for something magical to happen? Do we stare at the machinery long and hard until what we think is important, happens? Through a tangled web of video projections and a system of mirrors, the Spun O Lith viewer is immediately stimulated with reflective materials – all supposedly found on the streets of Brooklyn, also referred to as “covert trash operations.” Channels of video feedback manipulate what you see. It’s a slow manipulation and you have to linger in the space to notice it. You may experience your refracted self, but never a refraction of reality.,It was evident that Gaffney could lure a crowd. Bushwickers swayed late into the evening, grinding to digital soundscapes and nursing drinks while wearing sunglasses – but the latter was part of the exhibition experience. Pick up a mirror and play. Darken your environment with shade.,The space definitely seemed to be curated for a Bushwick crowd; it had a messy-cool feel to it. The foil on the walls hung sloppily, wires weaved in and out of the floor, a bit ominous for someone holding a drink. But, Spun O Lith showcased found objects that YOU could have touched; work in progress ideas that were evolving in real-time, which presented the opportunity for the audience to connect to the live process. The trashy layout seemed purposeful, maybe , was the point.,When I asked Gaffney about her inspiration, she mentioned “the wasteland.” Approaching her latest collaborative project with “easy instinct,” Gaffney is open to whatever comes in her path. She lists her favorite contemporary artists as the people she’s working with right now, “light channelers and demon blockers.”,Here’s a video with Spun O Lith collaborator, Matthew Caron.,Ultimately, Gaffney wants viewers to get “high on light” when roaming through the condensed space. Try to allow yourself to flow with the changing exhibition, and if you’re having difficulty with that, try putting on some sunglasses. Maybe bring a few glow sticks of your own, as well.,Spun O Lith will be open at Fitness Center for Arts and Tactics until March 15, and will feature a changing variety of video artists and musicians.",I am interested in immersive experiences of all kinds.

"Featured,In the Hood","As is the nature of New York (and something we will ALWAYS be discussing), the rising rents in the once affordable neighborhoods are pushing New York newbies further out on subway lines. People are even going past *gasp* the Jefferson Street L station. OMG!!!!!,Yes, the rumors are true. As Craigslist annoyingly proves day after day, recently graduated students and transplants who are just kicking off their careers must now move as far as ,. But just how cool is life that far out on the line? Is it worth living in the boonies just to be off the L train and close to places like Morgan Ave where there are Yelp acclaimed bars and Zagat rated restaurants? Here’s an idea. Let’s find out!, ,For those who have never made the trip, the L train Halsey stop is literally right on the border of Bushwick, Brooklyn and Ridgewood, Queens. These two neighborhoods paint a very different picture, as Queens is known to give you way more bang for your buck nowadays than Brooklyn or Manhattan a.k.a. the mothership of exhorbitence and ridiculousness. According to ,, the average rent for a three bedroom in Ridgewood is $1751, as opposed to hotspot Morgan Ave area where it’s $2,792. What da funk. No wonder mofos are searching for dwellings in other seas.,Ridgewood is about the same on the crime scale as Bushwick. So far in 2013, , precinct has had 221 crime complaints for felonies, as opposed to , which has had 226, including two murders. But there has been one more reported rape in Ridgewood than Bushwick which, if you’re like me, is what you , care about. However, in other sex crimes, Bushwick outweighs Ridgewood 9 to 2 which is terrifying. But there’s many more burglaries in Ridgewood than Bushwick. So whether you feel safe or unsafe off Jefferson and DeKalb, you’ll likely feel the same off Halsey.,
But let’s not focus on these stats. They’re just the crime numbers, people. And while it’s ,important to know this stuff, nobody wants to talk about depressing things all day. AMIRITE?? We also want to know how it actually feels to live off Halsey. What are the apartments like? Where do the residents eat and hang out? WHY LIVE LIFE ON THE EDGE??? (And by that, I mean the Brooklyn-Queens edge).,Richard P. of Covert Street originally moved to Washington Heights two years ago. As a musician, Richard found himself having public transit escapades from upper Manhattan to Brooklyn because all the venues he wanted to visit are in the ‘Wick or the ‘Burg. Think about it. The L train is simply strung with hot concert spots like , and or , that used to be a storage facility. “Even though I was living [in Washington Heights], I wasn’t really hanging out in Manhattan. It’s a deadzone. There’s nothing for me, musically. My catch phrase actually is ‘Maybe Manhattan.’” (We both had a chuckle at that one. You gotta hand it to him. You really do).,When Richard first made the switch to north Brooklyn, he was living off the Montrose stop on the L, but then moved to Halsey for cheaper rent. Right now he’s only paying $500 for one bedroom in a two bedroom apartment. “Yeah it’s further, but there’s no downside really. If you’re expecting something glamorous, Halsey will let you down. But if you want something cheap, you have to make concessions.” While he says there’s nowhere really to go right off his stop in terms of bars, cafes and restaurants, he knows a lot of other people on Halsey, so for fun he’ll usually hang out at a friend’s place. “Other than that there’s really nothing to do. Even bodegas close by 10 p.m. Like I said, it’s not glamorous.”,Theresa D. of Hancock is quite content with Halsey. She has a three bedroom apartment where she also has an amazing redone backyard and entire basement to use as a practice space for her band. “I like that it’s a real neighborhood, not a summer camp like other areas off the L, like Morgan. The nightlife is a bit dry, but if we want to go out, we usually take the B60 to Morgan or Jefferson Street, and it’s only a 5 minute ride.” Theresa expressed that being close to her friends was a huge factor in deciding where to live, and most of her friends live off the L. She’s also able to feel like she can have an actual home in her current situation, which is in a brownstone, as opposed to 532 Johnson where she used to live, and said felt very temporary and a bit janky. I asked Theresa if she felt safer off Halsey versus 532 Johnson which is situated in a very desolate, industrial area. “532 Johnson was a bit weird because it’s desolate and near the DOE fund. Halsey is quiet in winter, but in the summer there’s a lot of parties and then a lot of cat-calling. But that can happen anywhere, and it’s a very family oriented neighborhood, so I guess it all depends.”,Santiago M. has been living off the Ridgewood side of Halsey for almost a year and feels very safe. He comes from a small town in New Mexico, so the residential feel of Ridgewood is actually comforting to him. “I can go home and feel relaxed. Bushwick is a little more rowdy than Ridgewood.” Santiago said that the selling point was definitely being off the L train. “I live close to the L and it’s a mainline, straight to the city.” As someone who works in film, Santiago finds himself all over New York for work, so the easy transfers on 14th Street make for a nice commute. While Santiago says there’s not much to do in general, there is a cool gallery called , in his neighborhood. “There’s not much else in terms of boutique places, but for general food it has everything you need. I can see more things opening up in the future though.”,Belen L, formerly of Summerfield Street, saw no upsides though. “I moved there because it was cheap. I thought it wasn’t that far, but didn’t realize how bad an extra four stops can be, especially when there’s nothing around you. There’s no bars, no cafes, nowhere to go. Every time I wanted to go somewhere I had to leave. And when you live in Ridgewood, none of your friends want to come visit you. There’s also smelly places where they have live chickens and bunnies you can butcher yourself. It stinks. And there’s no good grocery stores aside from a grubby Western Beef.” When I asked her if she ever hung out there while living there, she said, “No. Not once.” When I asked if she saw any benefit to living there, she said, “If you’re looking to have family and a boring place close to fun places, sure. Well, semi-close, anyway.”,So what we’ve gathered is, yes, Halsey means extra time on the train and, yes, it can be a little boring and not necessarily safer. But if you’re a north Brooklyn lover who needs an affordable pad in a real neighborhood with actual families and schools and stuff (and you have a good playlist for your commute), Halsey could be right for you. Think about that brownstone you’ve always wanted to sit on the stoop of during the summer like in ,. You can actually have it in Ridgewood. And if Williamsburg is your farthest destination most of the time, things are still close. Well, semi-close. But even if you don’t plan on moving there, visit your friends who do. You could be hanging out in an awesome backyard like Theresa’s or getting to know people at the surrounding lofts like Richard does. And if you’re not going to even do that, at least consider investing in a place for when Halsey’s first bourgeois-dega opens up and the area is worth a flippin’ goldmine.","To me, life is meant to be classy-trashy. Nothing’s better than bouncing from a rooftop terrace-soiree and rolling into a warehouse party in the same leopard-print dress.

Arts and Culture,"Occasionally, attending a Bushwick gallery opening can feel like stumbling into a hidden garden of rare and enchanting foliage amongst a barren and lonely landscape. That’s the experience , tends to provide, given their location of a studio on the third floor inside an unmarked factory building on Stewart Avenue. TSA opened their doors in Bushwick in November, but the members (all artists as well) have been curating exhibitions in their Philadelphia location, Tiger Strikes Asteroid, since 2009., opened on February 22, and was actually too crowded to walk in at times! Upon a second visit during open hours, I was given the privilege of spending ample time with each piece. According to the press release, this group show ”brings together a group of emerging and established contemporary visual artists whose practices examine the realms of science fiction, mythology, alternative histories and other forms of creative speculation.” One piece by each artist, all modestly spaced and mostly medium-sized, allows room for said creative speculation, and each work takes a vastly different approach in both medium and content to evoke the themes that tie together the exhibition.,Sean McCarthy’s incredibly detailed ink and graphite drawing on paper depicts an entirely unknown and mysterious creature. The delicacy of the marks invite the viewer to stand intimately close to the piece, as well as its lack of color and thus domesticity, despite the nightmarish animal that fills the entire page.,On the opposing wall, Rachel Frank’s sculpture, consisted of a stretched Holstein cowhide, glass beads, thread, wood, and cloth, complements the primitive McCarthy drawing. It too has a sense of domesticity given the glass beads and beautiful fur, but it is also abrasive and may be slightly repulsive to some.,Christopher Ulivo (a co-organizer of the exhibition) presents a small egg tempera painting of some fictional (perhaps?) scene involving struggle and triumph. This piece seems to be the only obvious narrative work in the show, and it’s one that makes the viewer really question the story and moment being painted. There may well be a specific reference driving the work, possibly relating to the title, but the mystery of the subject and execution of the painting is enough for me to contemplate.,Jackie Hoving’s work on paper relates to the overall themes present in the show, most directly in the primitivism evoked by earth tones and the rough texture of the materials.,Not all of the works in the show are included here, in an effort to induce a level of curiosity similar to the one you will receive once spending time with each piece. Works not pictured here are by David Humphrey, Andrew Prayzner (co-organizer), and Amanda Lechner (co-organizer).

"Featured,Music","Before you get tripped up on the rumble of consonants above, get in the know: , stands for ,, America’s most diverse and innovative multimedia festival. Endearingly called “South By” by fans and veterans, the festival brings great minds and talent together in Austin, Texas for over a week of entertainment, learning and discussion in the realms of music, technology and film. The official festival events require a pricey badge (upwards of $1000), so you may be wondering how some of your party animal friends can afford top travel and lodging costs. Well, this is how you do it right.,Well, in case you didn’t know, you can go and enjoy the music portion of SXSW like a badge holder for free. No, we’re not exaggerating. You can see all of your favorite indie bands, all whilst drinking and eating as a guest of Austin ,. Read on for the inside scoop, and our recommendations for this year’s music portion of SXSW, March 13-16, 2013…,The festival, which is in its 27th year, attracts over 30,000 official badge holders to Austin. Unofficially, there’s likely an additional 15-20,000 band members and fans who flock to SXSW to experience the biggest indie music event in the US. For musicians, performing at SXSW is about getting as much exposure as humanly possible. It’s the one time per year that bands are willing (and able) to play several shows a day, for 4+ days in a row. That means that if a band is doing SXSW right, and they manage to score an official show (rare for most of today’s under the radar indie bands) they’ll also be playing a lot of unofficial shows.,But how do all of these “unofficial” showcases come about? Besides house/bookstore parties (which are so unique to SXSW and totally worth checking out), everyone wants to get their name associated with the cool stuff going down during the fest. That means sponsors in all shapes and sizes – food, drink, publication, blog, clothing – are glad to fund parties to get in the mix with all the cool kids. SXSW is basically a corporate playground, with massive sponsors willing to foot the bill to be associated with some of the best parties this side of Tennessee.,To give you an idea of who’s behind this free madness, some of the biggest unofficial parties of SXSW 2013 have food/drink sponsors like ,, Zico, ,, ,,  ,, ,, and at least 100 more. Clothing brands such as Vans, Dickies, ,, and , have hopped aboard. Music sites, publications and blogs like , (who’s currently collabing on the most shows this year), ,, Spin, ,, ,, ,, Portals, Gorilla vs. Bear, Yourstru.ly, ,, ,, and , are the curators of these showcases. And this is only skimming the surface. Other types of sponsors, like ,, ,, ,, are providing some bucks to get involved, too. So basically, if you’re willing to trade your consumer attendance to go on a rollercoaster ride fueled by free drink, food, and amazing music that’s completely dictated by which sponsors spat where, you’re ready for SXSW.,Want to go to SXSW and experience all of this nonstop craziness for 4 days straight? Did we mention it’s really warm and sunny and amazing, plus Austin is an incredible city for food, shopping and – let’s not forget - MUSIC? It’s hard to know exactly where to start – it all seems too good to be true. Logistically, the first thing you’ll have to do is get organized with your travel options while in Texas. Flying down is the best option, unless you can take more than a week off of work and feel like road tripping with a friend’s band. Flights run between , to Austin from NYC during SXSW and, as expected, are cheaper the earlier you buy them. San Antonio is nearby and flights can run significantly , if you can get a ride or take the bus. Once you’re down there you’ll need somewhere to stay. If you’re lucky, you have a Best Friend in Austin (shout out to Morgane!), or a friend of a friend whose floor you can crash on, or a van that’s not too stiff. If none of those are an option, you can get a hotel, although , or , will offer a much more authentic Austin experience, though the affordable options get picked over early on., ,Sounds expensive so far, but once you get over that hump, you will spend very little money once you’re down there; there is free food and drink galore. Transportation can be a bitch, so get some comfortable cowboy boots because you are going to be huffing it, A LOT. Venues are spread all over downtown, the East Side, South of the city, and closer to the University of Texas. The buses are a great option too, and if you’re feeling responsible enough to bike drunk, you can rent a bike.,Now that you’ve got it all figured out logistically (hopefully a month or more ahead of time), you have to sit tight and wait patiently for the parties to roll in. ,. Even now, a week and a half before the festival, I am hearing about and RSVPing to more parties than ever. Once they do, you’ll have to dedicate a chunk of hours to what I like to call “stalking SXSW,” or RSVPing for every single thing you see popping up on the internet that’s free. , that you really want to go to – these will be hard to get into and will require a lot of patience waiting in line, so get there early. Then there are the parties that feature less popular bands and you could care less about a random line-up from Scotland, or whatever this “,” promises. These are the best parties to hit up in the meantime, to fill up on food and drink, expand your musical horizons, and maybe even enjoy what you hear. Then you head to your next spot. There are showcases happening literally everywhere. You may find yourself stopping by 10+ shows a day so please pace yourself. Or you might end up tired like these guys.,As far as finding out which shows/parties to attend, there are a million resources on the web for you to peruse. Here are some of our favorites, and recommendations from ,:,It’s also easy and informative to follow a few specific twitter handles who churn out the parties as they get them. They feature some smaller or more under the radar parties that are really worth the click. Although be careful – some parties listed are during Interactive and may be before you arrive. Some of our recommendations:,Eventually, once you RSVP to enough things, you’ll have an excellent spreadsheet that looks like this so your friends can keep in the loop and you’ll all be able to get into the same parties.,So that’s SXSW, done unofficially, in a nutshell. Seem like a lot of work? Not worth all the hype? Don’t want to spend hours fretting, RSVPing, and then dealing with tedious lines, crowds, and drunk masses once you’re down there? You just might not love the music festival scene enough. It takes a lot out of you and may be the hardest you’ll ever party, but there is truly no better place for a music lover. We’ll see you there and keep your eyes out for our BK in Austin article coming next week., , ",strict rule breaker. photographer. music obsessee. brooklynite.,"2012,2013,austin texas,filter,music,parties,SXSW,sxsw 2011,sxsw 2012,taco bell,unofficial","
									Why SXSW Is Awesome & How to Do It Right							",Maria Gotay,,
In the Hood,"Oftentimes, we call in a smokescreen cornucopia of occurrences because we have not yet gotten “right,” as I call it, with what we desire. If you have layers of shame, fear and judgment around what you really want to do with your life and who you really want to be, you are going to have a difficult time calling it in clearly, and you will have an even more difficult time receiving it. Getting right with your desires is the second key ingredient in the ritual to receive because you cannot invite and accept something if you are not clear about what exactly you want.,This is a task to get clear about what you want. What will it do for you? How will it make you FEEL? Who are you and what will you know about yourself when you receive this thing you desire? When you have shame about your desires, you literally push what you want away from you. Even if you really do WANT it, when you are not “right,” or in alignment with what you desire, you cannot and will not receive it.,To get right with your desires, sort through and resolve the resistance you have to getting what you want. If you don’t want to deal with the responsibility, the added things to manage, the vulnerability, the judgment, the unpredictability, the…list goes on and on…from an energetic perspective you are then literally telling the universe that you are not ready to receive it, and you will not get it.,Get right with your desires now or they will always and forever be future tense. They will never, ever become embodied commitments in the present moment. The nature of desire is yearning and reaching for something in front of you. The nature of having is to envelop, take in and accept. Whatever you have not accepted about what you desire is the exact reason that it is still a desire and not something you actually have right now. Each moment is a choice and that choice is yours. I’d love to know what stands between you and your desires this week.

"Featured,Food and Drink","Now that we’re a bit deeper into Bushwick, it takes a little more work (and a little more walking) to reach great bars. But at the rate Bushwick has been developing (ahem, gentrifying), who knows if this will still be true in a year? For now, here are three bars to visit near the 8th L stop in Brooklyn, Dekalb.,Taking their name from the original 17, century Dutch translation of Bushwick, this new-ish bar from the owners of , takes its name to heart, with a rustic vibe played up by a décor of taxidermy, potted flora, and lots of, well, heavy wood trimmings. Along with a wide selection of whiskeys, tequilas and mescals, fourteen craft beers are on tap ($5), all of which can be enjoyed with Tchoup Shop’s amazing New Orleans style BBQ and bar snacks, like their “awesome” deviled eggs ($3) or crab-okra hush puppies ($8). While it’s not the first (nor the last) Bushwick bar with a forest-inspired name, it may be the only one to exist as a coffee shop by day and a dim bar by night, effectively providing Bushwickers with two of their favorite vices – strong coffee and even stronger whiskey., Try their “Soup of the Day”, a $5 PBR + whiskey shot.,This comfortable neighborhood bar and restaurant is a Bushwicker’s alternative to the too-hip dives and upscale cocktail joints popping up all over the place. Ali, the owner and jack-of-all-trades (bartender, cook, janitor) is a long-time denizen of the area, endearing himself both to tried-and-true locals and the influx of young starvin’ artists populating the area. Along with cheap, strong drinks, he serves a menu of his native Lebanese cuisine and there’s free wi-fi. The bar food is unpretentious, the drinks are cheap, and every Wednesday, it’s free pasta night from 8-9pm. In fact, the only way you might know you’re still in Bushwick is that Two80 also offers a $5 beer + shot special. And where else can you get a $2 can of PBR while snacking on homemade hummus?, Try one of Ali’s famous mojitos ($5), made with mint he grew himself,An ode to both superheroes and friendly dive bars, this cozy (i.e. small) haven for comic book nerds is recognizable by the giant mural of Batman outside. Like any good superhero, this bar has a secret identity that’s only revealed once you’ve been buzzed through the entrance. Inside, you’ll discover Wonder Woman, Underdog and Captain America, all staring down from posters and figurines lining the walls. Another secret? The cheap prices, with $3 PBR-and–whiskey combos, $4 Brooklyn Lagers, and mixed drinks named after your favorite superheroes for under $8. The crowd is a mix of twentysomethings trying to make it and fortysomething X-Men junkies who on Saturday nights can all be seen playing pool, arcade games, and Guitar Hero., Get in the hero-spirit with the Green Lantern (Zubrowka, apple schnapps, Sprite) or Wonder Woman (Citron vodka, blueberry vodka, OJ, and pomegranate), both at $8","Writer, editor and sometime photographer.

Nevertheless, they seem to have some enjoyment and appreciation of each other, so they are both winners.,The moral of the story here is that they made an effort to have some growth in their lives and got to meet new people, and they got a free meal to boot.

Arts and Culture,"Sometimes you walk around Bushwick and you know where you are going.,Sometimes you don’t know where you want to end up. The majority of the times, you know where you are going, but you don’t know what is about to come. This past Tuesday, I found my way to the Morgan Bar where ,and , invited me to the world of ,.,Burlesque retains a special relationship with its audience. An audience that every night enters in this mystagogy of eroticism with nude goddesses and bacchian satyrs. They scandalize us and taunt us to be one with them in the celebration of the body. And as the performance grows throughout time, the audience grows along with it. Last Tuesday I met people who had been attending the Bushwick Burlesque performances consistently for a year, when the troupe was in its nascent stages, as well as newbies who said it was their first time. One long-time audience member told me that this performance evolved from hosting just a group of friends, to attracting a much larger and more diverse audience.,Scary Ben told me that along with the growing audience, the troupe has been evolving into more of a performance art show seen through the lens of cabaret. They are slowly building the show to be more of a ,. They are nonsensical and they don’t follow the rules, by making them up as they go along, or by breaking them like they break the boundaries between the stage and the audience.,The show, which morphs into something different each time, was about love. A week after Valentine’s, love was still a theme in Bushwick and Scary Ben promised us “Boobs, booze, balls and more.” Once we got the burlesque etiquette out of the way, we were introduced to this night’s , Miss ,, who delivered a short and funny sketch with ,. She was followed by the “International Burlesque Sensation and Mastermind of Bizarre Extravaganza,” ,, dressed as a femme fatale from the past. She was a woman filled with mystique and stories of men passed and gone, and by the end invited us to the praise of the nude goddess. Later, Scary Ben connected with the audience by creating a rhythmic clap in unison. The Chameleon of the Tease , got on stage and threw her accessories, articles of clothing and an oval ring into a box of mementos, as if they were individual memories.,People socialized during the intermission, talking loudly, laughing and carrying the atmosphere into the second part of the show, which began in darkness with dim lighting on Scary Ben. What started ominously became a ridiculous confession sang by a clown. He was interrupted by a loud and profane version of “Take me to the next whiskey bar” by , a tease of what we would see in the end.,This last act gave way to a regular routine for Bushwick Burlesque that involves the audience becoming a part of the performance and showing off a combination of skills and nudity. It was a competition that didn’t discriminate against genders; both men and women were able to show off their booty bouncing. The best won, by the audience’s approval, a drink at the bar and a place in Bushwick Burlesque’s Hall of Fame. Darlinda rode the wave of joy with a disco infused sketch in a performance inspired by the eroticism of Valentine’s night, filling the stage with condoms as her own version of erotic confetti.,In this celebratory mood, it was time for the birthday love. It was the time for the birthday girl to receive, needless to say, the , sexiest lap dance in Bushwick.,Professional sensationalist ,, got onstage to the sounds of Bjork’s “It’s Oh So Quiet” and dressed as a pink fluffy bunny, dancing frantically and teasing everybody in the audience. For the final act we welcomed Cherry Typhoon to the stage, dressed in a blue sparkly dress and holding a classic Japanese umbrella, dancing into a sketch filled with cultural references from around the world. After her performance, cherry blossoms on stage, the show was over.,I found my way home after participating into this celebration of the profane, of the sexy, the vulgar and the kitsch combined with unlimited amounts of funny limericks, songs and slapstick, and realized that it wasn’t anything that I was expecting.

This forest installation ,, which was partly made possible by chicken wire and papier-mâché, was inspired by the artists’ deep love and connection to natural beauty as well as the “wonder found in nature and the ever-present guiding grace of the great spirit permeating all living things.” Masonek also describes the Great Creator as well as everyday marvels, such as birds taking flight, as powerful sources of inspiration.,Surrounded by walls showcasing Masonek and Leiser’s holographic and mixed media artwork, gallery goers are easily transported to a dreamy place. “What I hope people receive from Heartcore is to walk out feeling refreshed and joyous,” Masonek says. “Looking within to the healing provided by opening the heart, and releasing all pain to the winds of change. I hope they can truly feel the medicine instilled within the heart core of the images displayed.” Masonek also let Bushwick Daily in on his creative process: “This deep well of gratitude and awe translates into my art by allowing me to step aside from ego based perception, and create through the eyes of the spirit. To be an observer of the wonders is a source of great power in photography. My drawings are a kind of freeform meditation in which my hands drive the vehicle to spaces of symbolism, surreal creatures and inner space.”,Eric and Jay’s work truly has the ability to remind us to take a better look around and really appreciate the natural wonders that we may take for granted each day., will be on exhibit until March 16th at The Living Gallery.

The judges gave their compliments and critiques, with accolades to Vivian V’s classic rendition with a stool that rivaled Sally Bowles in ,.

Arts and Culture," performed the seraphic , at the , in East Williamsburg this past weekend. ,, directed and choreographed by Karen Harvey, focused on the impact water has on our human experience and reminded us of its simple and powerful beauty. This evening-length performance showcased a love for nature and a need to express that love through movement.,Originally from Knightdale, North Carolina, Harvey’s parents owned a canoeing company called “Quiet Water Canoes.” Her stately and childhood influences are apparent throughout. , exhibited a journey that provided a concrete conclusion: “Water knows no boundaries.” By incorporating live music, modern dance and site-specific video, Harvey deconstructed water into three sections – “Enter,” “Journey,” and “Flow.”,Upon entry, six large silver bowls adorned the downstage area, which contained water, colored rocks (think science museum gift shop) and tangled jewelry. The cast splashed, dripped and poured the water, playing with the intensity of live sound and mimicking water’s unpredictable and unprecedented temperament. This decision created diverse soundscapes and a serene environment, an appropriate echo for the theme at hand.,The opening text was taken from an interview between Karen Harvey and John Connors, a wetland biologist and the director of the ,. Dancers complemented the blogtalkradio-esque audio through gentle partnering, always keeping an eye out for one another. The recording also included excerpts from Henry David Thoreau’s “Walking,” an essay concerning the relationship between civilization and wilderness. The text provided clues towards the dancers’ physicality, a metaphor for the wetland ecosystem. Protecting one another within their phrase work and intertwining patterns, each lunge pliéd towards a fellow dancer, fluid port de bras weaved in between torsos. Circulating the metaphorical flow, companionship was obvious from the get-go.,To illustrate global connectivity from a natural element, Harvey showcased videos from Scotland, Oregon, Korea, Spain and Mexico, among others. Interspersed between dance phrases, the video segments varied in length, but all had two common threads: dance and water. One video stood out in particular; filmed on the coast of Spain on a cloudy day, Silvia Balvin, collaborator and short film subject, pranced and stretched in the shallow ocean waters. She appeared contemplative, alone, playful and fascinated. The sand was thick and noiseless under her busy toes. Saturated with deep blues and grays, the perspective made the subject appear at home with water, a creature ,. It was these quiet moments within Harvey’s segmented programming that allowed for , to have a cohesive and unifying flow.,Here’s another site-specific video that showcases Harvey’s North Carolina influences:,A cappella chants and hymns from cast members René Kladzyk and Andrew Broaddus punctuated Harvey’s poetic experience. Their singing reminded me of hiking trips and how one can choose to observe the melodic elements in a forest: bodies of water, trees, animals, the crunch of dirt under feet. These poised chants developed that landscape on stage, again tying together the theme of waters naturalistic soundscapes.,Harvey’s movement research about society’s dependence on nature managed to maneuver away from stereotypical hippie tendencies, and instead created a consistent and artistic landscape. All elements and characters had a purpose and pleasantly delivered a composed and aloof message to an eager audience. I look forward to Harvey’s future questions and concerns about our world, and am certainly curious how her work will fit into our technologically driven landscape.",I am interested in immersive experiences of all kinds.

"Featured,In the Hood","Bushwick is a land of authenticity and changing landscapes. Bars, cafes, artists – there’s a lot going on in this bohemian community. Alas, as more people move in, it’s harder to find quality, low-priced apartments. The following descriptions are a ,, not exhaustive, subway stop by subway stop breakdown of where to live and why.,. Back in the day, we called it Bushwick because it was the closest major outpost to Bushwick proper (just across Flushing Ave). These days it’s Morgantown, a bourgeois community of the artistically affluent. Most of the quality property has been snatched up already, and rent is no longer “cheap” (under $800 a month). But you pay for what you get. Brooklyn classics such as Roberta’s have maintained, even after the former Secretary of State ate here, good service, a cool vibe, and excellent pizza. And because it’s still fifteen minutes from Union Square it’s close enough to be the last stop on the yuppie train.,: If you can afford it, Morgantown has a lot to offer, even if it’s not technically Bushwick.,Over the past year there has been a flurry of activity in Jeffersonton. Property is more readily available off this stop than at Morgan, although it can still be pricey, especially for loft space. As gentrification has spread up Knickerbocker Avenue, it has led to a largely amicable relationship between Hispanics and Hipsters. One of my favorite examples is ,, whose sign-less exterior is wedged between a loosie-selling bodega and a laundromat. It’s one of many , off this subway stop, along with tried and true favorites such as , and ,.,: Jeffersonton is still up and coming, and if you want a blend of youthful scene and neighborhood character, it’s probably your best value.,There are only a few blocks between Jefferson and this stop, but in that gap is a world of difference. The number of Chinese restaurants with bulletproof glass is a sign that Williamsburg-style gentrification is still a couple of years away. Rentals are cheaper than near Jeffersonton, and it’s just a short walk to the many bars and restaurants in the area. If you’re not intimidated by the extra few minutes on the train, DeKalb has plenty of value. Plus, the bodega near the south entrance to the L offers some of the dankest sandwiches around – their three flat screens show a hundred options, and they’re open all night.,: If you want to live on the edge of “safe” Bushwick, DeKalb is a great option. And with easy access to Jeffersonton’s scene, you can avoid paying a premium for great nightlife.,I was once waiting at this stop for my friend to text me directions to his party when I heard a black guy talking about how punk-ass white kids are moving in, changing the neighborhood. I stopped and asked him why he was hatin’. He was surprised and sheepish. We wound up chatting about how he lived here back when it was the toughest place in the entire city. We exchanged numbers and although I never called him, it was still a pleasant interaction. While there are a couple of bars and restaurants in the area, the real reasons to live here are for the L/M transfer and the cheap accommodations.,: If you’re a lady walking around alone late at night, this may be a little deep into Bushwick for you. But if you want to save and live with three of your best friends, Myrtle-Wyckoff isn’t a bad look.,Long considered Bushwick’s final frontier, the Halsey stop’s main draws are loft space and cheap condo living. Halsey is far though, and with little to do in terms of bars and restaurants, you will likely have to invest in a monthly MetroCard to experience any sort of night life. On the other hand, if you have a band, need a painting studio or just want a more secluded Bushwick lifestyle, Halsey could be the perfect place for you.,: Halsey is deep, cheap and a fine place to live if you want to hole up and produce some good art.,The M train goes to the LES, Nolita and the West Village before it heads uptown. Although it doesn’t go into Manhattan on weekends, we all know there’s so much going on in Bushwick there’s really no reason to leave. If you must, however, Canal’s only fifteen minutes away on the J. While the bar scene is a little grungier than in North Bushwick, newly opened Bizarre and Skytown are signs that a more posh clientele is moving in. And since there’s more diversity here than in other parts of Bushwick, it can be easier to exchange ideas with others than it is off the cliquey L train Bushwick stops. Myrtle-Broadway, or Downtown Bushwick as I like to call it, may not be as aesthetically pleasing as other areas in Bushwick, what with the broken sidewalks and the above-ground train, but these elements add a different artistic energy to the air.,: Because it’s cheaper to live off the JMZ than the coveted L, you’re likelier to encounter the bohemia that Morgantown , to be.,This stop is a gateway to the restaurants and cafes on Wilson and its eponymous avenue. Maria Hernandez Park is close by too, and property is cheaper than if you live off the L train. True, you have to wait for the M shuttle to take you one stop to Myrtle-Broadway on the weekends, but if that doesn’t bother you, Central Ave is definitely worth a look.,: For a slight M train inconvenience you get a “Central” location, with Broadway and Bogart both a walk away.,Now that M service to this stop has been ,, look for new bars and cafes to open in the coming months. In the meanwhile, you can easily walk to those near Jefferson and DeKalb, while saving a little more on your monthly rent. Thirty years ago, Knickerbocker Avenue used to be crack alley. Today there are heaps of stores and services (think lower Graham Ave) , a Burger King.,: With a number of inexpensive retail stores and banks, and bars and cafes within walking distance, this stop is a sleeper ready to wake.,We hope this quick survey of selected Bushwick subway stops has helped you decide where to move, or at least hang out, according to your needs. Perhaps the best part about Bushwick is the quickly shifting demographics. With so many new people moving in all the time, by this time next year, gentrification will have taken another step, apartment prices will likely be higher, and you may have more young, hip neighbors. Whatever your background, these are factors to consider, whether you’re moving to Bushwick for the first time or you’ve been here since the old days.","Daniel Ryan Adler is a Brooklynite by birth, and has also lived in Portland.

"Featured,In the Hood","Better known to film fans for her bawdy screen performances and her ever-quotable double entendres, , was a Brooklyn native and fixture of the NYC theater scene long before moving to Hollywood in 1932 and cementing her reputation as the “Queen of Sex.”,Mae West was so tied to NYC’s early 20th century that many neighborhoods – like Woodhaven, Queens, where a plaque at 89-05 88th Street marks a former home, and the Upper West Side, where Mae owned a townhome at 266 West End Avenue – can boast of her, but no community figures more prominently in her history than our very own Bushwick.,Born Mary Jane West in her family home on August 17th, 1893, Mae’s exact birthplace remains a point of contention, with Bushwick and Greenpoint both laying claim to that title. Part of the confusion might arise from Mae herself. On a homecoming tour of Brooklyn in the 1930s, Mae reportedly told the press she was born on Willoughby Avenue between Greenpoint and Bushwick.  That location, even if we consider the possibility that she meant Greenpoint Avenue and Bushwick Avenue, does not seem to exist on maps from today, nor from that time period.,By and large, the overall consensus is that Mae was, in fact, born in Bushwick, though the family proceeded to move frequently throughout North Brooklyn. Biographies suggest Mae lived at undetermined addresses on Herbert Street, Meeker Avenue, Humboldt Street, Varet Street, and Linden Street, to name a few. However, the family’s ever-changing residences were only as frenzied as Mae’s growing schedule. Making her professional debut at age 7 – performing as “Baby Mae” at Downtown Brooklyn’s since-demolished Royal Theatre (15 Willoughby Street) – Mae would become well-known on the vaudeville circuit, and by 1907, she joined Hal Clarendon’s Stock Company of dramatic actors.,Despite the frequent moves, the West family appeared to build its strongest ties to Bushwick and its bordering community of Ridgewood. In fact, Mae’s famed manner of speaking was thought to exemplify what one writer called the “Bushwick Avenyah” accent – an accent that was once described as more of a “dialect, like Cockney,” that was “a life-long affliction.” Mae’s Bushwick was an “enclave of German-born brewmasters,” with 14 breweries operating in the area by 1890 and, fittingly, the community was largely occupied by German immigrants. Amongst them was Mae’s mother, Matilda “Tillie” Delker, who moved from Bavaria in 1886 and later married Mae’s father, “Battlin’ Jack” West, a former prizefighter who was, according to Mae, an “epic figure in Brooklyn.”,By the age of 14, Mae was dating Joe Schenck, a vaudeville performer who was said to rehearse with his partner, Gus Van, on Saturday nights at Mae’s family home on Bushwick Avenue. While that address is unknown, in a 1970 interview, Mae declared, “Tomorrow I’m going out to Bushwick – we lived next door to Mayor [John] Hylan – to see what’s left of the old place.” Hylan, the mayor of New York from 1918 to 1925, was a longtime Bushwick resident who lived at 959 Bushwick Avenue in the line of Italianate Rowhouses that span from 945 – 965 Bushwick Avenue (between Bleecker and Menahan).,It was likely around this time that Mae was a student at Ridgewood’s P.S. 81Q (559 Cypress Avenue, between Bleecker and Menahan), where a former classmate once recalled a teacher criticizing her frequent absences. Reports vary, but some believe that Mae had effectively dropped out of school by age 13 to pursue her growing stage career.,Mae and her family were residing at 421 Stanhope Street (between Cypress and St. Nicholas Ave) by 1910, at which point Mae’s acting resume was growing.  In fact, in the 1910 Census report, a 17 year-old Mae was listed as having the profession of “actress, vaudeville.” By 1911, she began performing on Broadway, making her debut in a “satirical burlesque” entitled ,.,While Mae continued to work as an actress, it wasn’t until 1926 that she became an instant legend with the Broadway debut of her own play, ,. Controversially set it in a Montreal brothel, and featuring Mae as a prostitute, the salacious show ran for 11 months before the acting mayor raided the show in 1927, arresting Mae and at least 20 cast members on charges of indecency. When asked by the presiding judge if she was “trying to show contempt” for the court, she famously responded, “On the contrary, your Honor. I was doin’ my best to conceal it.”,Refusing to close the show to avoid charges, Mae was later found guilty of “corrupting the morals of youth” and sentenced to 10 days of jail (“10 days on principle,” according to her), 9 of which were spent at a workhouse on Welfare (now Roosevelt) Island. (The other day was spent at the Women’s House of Detention, now the site of the West Village’s Jefferson Market Garden.) The jail time only increased her celebrity, and when a magazine paid her $1,000 for an exit interview, Mae used the money to create the Mae West Memorial Library for female prisoners.,While Mae’s plays continued to raise eyebrows (including 1927’s ,, often called the first to portray gay characters in a sympathetic light), in 1928, Mae opted to debut her latest play, ,, in Bushwick. At the time, Bushwick was the site of a strong theater scene, with RKO Bushwick (1396 Broadway, between Howard and Madison), Loew’s Gates (1340 Broadway, between Quincy and Gates), and Empire Theater (10 Ralph Avenue, between Quincy and Lexington), which was known as a burlesque house before a police crackdown in the 1930s., was the story a “fallen woman” in seedy 1890s Bowery, and rumor has it that Mae funded it herself by selling her diamond bracelet collection. It ran for five days of previews at Teller’s Shubert Theater (once the Century Theater), at 850 Monroe Street (between Ralph and Howard), before moving to Broadway, where it became Mae’s first critical success.  The show, which ran for 176 performances, later served as the inspiration for her “Lady Lou” character in 1933’s ,, which she starred in opposite Cary Grant., ,When another of her play’s, 1928’s ,, was raided and cited again for indecency, Mae’s stardom was further solidified. By 1932, Mae opted to try her hand in the motion picture industry and moved to Hollywood’s Ravenswood Apartments, where she remained until her passing in 1980. During her time in Hollywood, she made just 12 feature films but she made such an impact on audiences that the American Film Institute named her one of the greatest female film stars of all time.,Reportedly fearful of ground burial, Mae was laid to rest alongside her family in the Cypress Hills Abbey, the most elevated mausoleum at the Cypress Hills Cemetery (833 Jamaica Avenue) on the Brooklyn/Queens border - a fitting place for a woman who spent her early adulthood crossing those boroughs with her family.,With a career spanning film, theater, radio, television, and even the occasional studio album, perhaps Bushwick’s own Mae West lived true to her own saying - “You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.”","Longtime TV employee and (even longer time) viewer.

She’s an established choreographer, teacher and performance artist living in Bushwick who you should know.,Nicole has been performing with dance companies, rock bands and video artists around the country for sixteen years in venues as varied as the Metropolitan Opera House, The Kennedy Center and ,. She has also appeared as a featured dancer in the major motion picture , and videos for the international rock art phenomenon, Fischerspooner. In 2003 Nicole co-founded ,with Larry Keigwin and remains its Associate Director.,Wolcott’s choreography has been performed in New York City at ,, the,, ,, , (formerly Dance Theater Workshop), ,, ,, CBGBs, Monkeytown, ,, , and around the country at ,, ,, ,, , and the ,.,In 2010 she was the Artist in Residence at ,, and more recently ,commissioned an evening of work, which premiered in April 2011 at Joe’s Pub. Presently she is an adjunct professor at , and continues to teach in private studios in New York City as well as travel the country as a guest artist.,I interviewed Nicole about her Bushwick experience. Here is what she had to say., ,
I didn’t just have one job, I had many. I was primarily collaborating with Larry Keigwin. To support that endeavor, I danced with Chezzam Entertainment at private parties, traveling a bit. I was also a personal trainer at Equinox.,
2007.,My husband and I actually quarreled about even looking at apartments here. He had lived here in the early 2000s and it did not leave a good impression. When we made the move in 2007, the neighborhood was much better. Besides our great apartment, we were so happy for the one coffee shop (,) and one restaurant (,). You just need one coffee shop to build community. The vibe in Bushwick has always been welcoming. Even though there was clearly a community here already, the warehouses allowed for a pioneer kind of feel. A solidarity of wanting to build something special here. Our previous neighborhood was like a bedroom community. People want to BE in Bushwick.,
I support all Bushwick restaurants and hope for their success. We had a steak dinner at Northeast Kingdom once that made us weep with joy. I’m a girl from Montana – home of the steak dinner – and it was the best I’ve had.,
The dance scene is growing. Anna Sperber has had her studio , here for years, which draws a lot of quality dancers here to rehearse. ,, of course, with the founding members all being vanguards of the contemporary and international modern dance: Jonah Bokaer, Loren Dempster, Miguel Gutierrez, and Jeremy Wade., has had shows reviewed by ,, which is really saying something when people of that ilk who feel they need a passport to go anywhere outside Manhattan, the exception being ,, show up. , has always supported dance in galleries, apartments and on rooftops.,All we need is one more hot performance space out here and I think we would hit the tipping point. My “Class and Cocktails” at the , on Monday nights is advanced and has a good turn out every week, including people who don’t live in this neighborhood. So, things are happening.,
It would be at ,. It’s an incredible film stage in a brick warehouse that has a,steampunk feel to it. It’s large and beautiful with dynamic options that could allow for the audience to be , the piece.,
Ever? That’s going too far back. In NYC, it was “Straight Duet” with Larry Keigwin.,
As soon as I think of one person, I think of another. I have a list of kick-ass dancers that inspire me. Someone who is constantly pushing himself as an artist and questioning conventional thoughts about dance is ,. He makes me think of the whole artistic vision, not just the dancer piece. I am deeply inspired by him as an artist who sees his life as art.,
The night we premiered “Straight Duet,” I danced with Larry Keigwin in a site specific piece outside of a villa in Montecito, CA. I walked in a wedding dress and proceeded to submerge in a heated pool that was surrounded by terracotta pots with fires burning inside. That felt amazing. The evening was magical.,

"Featured,Food and Drink","Since we “celebrated” Presidents Day last weekend by making a few bad decisions Sunday night and skipping work on Monday, this week’s Drink & Ride takes us to the aptly named Jefferson stop. Luckily, a bunch of new spots have opened up nearby in the past year which means you won’t have to go thirsty for long.,Sometimes, the best way to wind down after a long day is exercise. No, it’s a stiff drink. No, it’s exercise. No, it’s…both? Luckily, as a yoga studio slash bar, , takes the stress of choosing off your hands, letting you indulge in both cocktails and sweat sessions (just not at the same time, please). After taking care of your body, treat your soul by pulling up a bar stool and enjoying playfully named drinks like the Last Caress, a mix of Lillet Rose and grapefruit soda ($8) or Teenagers from Mars, a Prosecco-Aperol drink topped with soda ($8). As you swap downward dog tips with fellow yogis/cocktail aficionados, play your favorite song on the jukebox and take in the spot’s simple, no-nonsense aesthetic. And since this is Bushwick, don’t miss out on the beloved beer + shot specials – their version is $6 Session Blacks + whiskey or Modelos + tequila (upgrade to a shot of Jameson or Espolon tequila for a buck more).,: Let the steam out of your ears with the Devil Lock, a jalapeno-infused tequila concoction with lime, orange and Tabasco ($10).,In Spain, bodega translates to “wine cellar.” In Brooklyn, it roughly translates to “place I get paper towels at 3am while a cat stares me down.” You’ll much prefer the European version after a visit to ,, run by self-proclaimed Spain freaks aiming to recreate the bar culture of their adopted homeland. Their success at creating a casual spot for locals to drink together is evident from the laid-back vibe, very neighborly low prices, and events like Tuesday movie nights. Inside, soft, flattering light streams down from exposed bulbs to shine on dark wood furnishings and deep red walls. Behind the bar, a friendly bartender is ready to pour a glass from the well-culled list of 20 vintages from Spain, France, Italy, Argentina and Chile (prices range from $5-$10 a pop). Beer lovers needn’t worry – they also pour 12 drafts and have a good list of Belgian and American bottles. And as it’s Spain-inspired, there’s also a list of small plates for nibbling, mostly fresh-cut charcuterie, gourmet cheeses and hearty sandwiches. Cash only., A Spanish red, like the 2006 Bodegas Lan Tempranillo ($8) or Borsao 2010 Garnacha ($5).,This quaint little spot was named after – and you might have guessed this – the owner’s spitfire of a grandmother, Pearl. Unfortunately (or fortunately), the crowd at , isn’t of the geriatric variety; it leans more towards twenty-something locals and slightly older artistic folks who’ve found their neighbor spot. With vintage New York pennants, dim lighting, a black-and-white photo booth, distressed wood accents, and various odd knick-knacks taking up shelf space, it sometimes feels like you’re drinking in that one cool friend’s apartment, if you’re living in the late ‘50s. Solidifying that retro vibe, drinks are served in mason jars (obviously), cheap tall boys are readily available and a mix of old school jams steadily flows in the background. There are rotating draft beers, including Brooklyn Lager, Pacifico and Left Hand Milk Stout ($5 to $6) and a fully stocked bar with a nice selection of whiskeys and bourbons. If you’re in the mood for a cocktail, ask the skilled bartender to whip up something special just for you or take a gander at their cocktail list, for favorites like the Pearl’s Cup, cucumber-infused gin with Pimms, strawberry and ginger ($10), or the scotch and apple brandy-based Autumner ($12).,: Taste the Spring-like drink, the Uncle Touchy, a fresh mix of tequila, ginger beer, honey, lemon and bitters.,A mix of personalities, , blends modern with vintage in everything from the menu to the decor. Honoring the old school, a vintage mahogany deco bar with matching green vinyl-topped stools (sourced from an old social club in Queens) takes up space in which to serve classic drinks like a Dark and Stormy ($9), brewed with the co-owners’ homemade ginger beer. On the more modern side, handmade ceramic tiles line the walls and provide an artistic tabletop for setting down your mug of local craft beer (like Sixpoint Autumnation,$6) and creative cocktails like the Chimbley Sweep ($10), an orange-infused drink of cardamom whiskey and Ramazzotti. The spot’s homey touch can be seen in the many handmade details throughout the space, from the ceramic beer mugs to the upscale bar snacks cooked by a co-owner to the tabletops they glazed themselves. On weekends, the back room turns into a dance party, complete with lasers, a fog machine, and DJs. Of course, there are $3 PBR tall boys, plus $7 Tecate and jalapeno tequila shot specials for when you really need to kick it up a notch., Warm yourself on a cold night with a Winter’s Gamble ($12), a gin drink with maraschino liqueur, orange bitters and cherries.,A former bodega space, , was transformed into a sleek yet casual wine bar serving up microbrews, wines from around the world, craft cocktails and small plates to tame your appetite. Pickled vegetables in mason jars provide functional decor while the aesthetic is all dark mahogany wood, mason jar candles, unique lighting involving a bicycle wheel, and a portrait of a very sophisticated dog named Miles - all coming together seamlessly, making it evident that one of the owners has a background in architecture. Both the wine and beer list are heavily curated, with a rotating selection of microbrews like Great Divide Titan IPA ($7) and Speakeasy Prohibition Ale ($6) on tap. The cocktail list takes on the classics, adding unique twists with ingredients like orchard peach liqueur, lavender spice bitters, oolong tea-infused whiskey, and chipotle-infused tequila (both of which are infused in-house) . The culinary focus is on affordable, slow-cooked eats (like a 3-bean vegetarian chili for $7), artisanal cheese and charcuterie plates, and gourmet sandwiches., The traditional winter Hot Toddy ($9), taken up a notch with house-infused black tea whiskey, allspice dram, citrus bitters, and cinnamon-infused honey.","Writer, editor and sometime photographer.

"Featured,In the Hood","Bushwick has been witness to a huge increase in the number of businesses in the past months - from , to , and pet stores. While this explosion gave Bushwick residents more reasons to hang out locally, it also raised many questions. Who actually owns these businesses, and who are these businesses created for?

However, the space they found on Central Ave was more suitable for a coffee shop. “Thank god we “only” opened a coffee shop…It is so much work!” says Letty. “We cut back a little but at first we have been working crazy hours there, and we both had jobs in addition. In fact I still have a job,” continues Carmen, who works at a city agency.,Carmen is a gifted interior designer who can turn any space into a cozy delight, and Letty used to work in the restaurant business when she lived in California. They complement each other when it comes to skills, and also personalities. Carmen’s father also used to own a bodega where she spent her summers behind a register. “Any experience was useful,” said Carmen.,Carmen and Letty are both Dominican. Letty moved to Bushwick with her parents as a 3-year old, and Carmen was born in New York. “My grandparents moved to Bushwick, and they never left. They bought a house, which they still own, and stayed through all the changes,” says Letty. “I went to day care and to 1st grade at Knickerbocker,” Carmen smiles. Later on, excitement and curiosity led Carmen to Manhattan and Europe. Letty was trying her luck as an actress in California. They both moved back to the neighborhood to open a business. “Bushwick is coming alive, you can step out of your house and go for a drink, desert, or juice…That’s the best feeling ever because we’re from here,” says Carmen.,Two years ago, Central Avenue desperately needed a coffee shop and, needless to say, cozy , became a hit among Bushwickians of all sorts of backgrounds. Owl Juice Pub was a natural move for the ladies. “We sat down, and thought about what the neighborhood needs, ” says Letty. “When we were building this place, people were stopping by and telling us, they were hoping this wasn’t going to be another bar. They wanted food…and we wanted to make juices!”,As business owners, Letty and Carmen say that it is great to be in Bushwick. “We still don’t have so many things here, so if you have a great idea, you can just do it,” says Carmen. “You only have to keep in mind young audience and that you can’t have Manhattan prices.”,“As for the old businesses, it is great for them as well,” Letty continues. “The bodega across the street from café expanded and renovated. They are not getting rid of old things, but they are adding new products like brown rice. And they didn’t raise the prices.”,We were also curious about the employees of Carmen and Letty. “We have a rainbow,” Letty laughs. “Hipster, not a hipster, all that matters to me is if the person can do it and is not lazy,” says Carmen. “We currently employ Mexicans, Dominicans, a person from Ohio, and even Russia.”,In regards to the future, Letty jokingly says, “We will open three more places, and have somebody else run it.” Carmen laughs too, “We’ll be chilling at a Caribbean island…”","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

Arts and Culture," ,Bushwick’s beloved , returned to the neighborhood last Friday night in its eighth iteration, supplying an eclectic mix of art ranging from grafitti-inspired art, abstract painting, to full-blown installation and performance. Entitled ,, this “nite” boasted an artfully and well-curated selection of ten participating galleries between the Jefferson, Dekalb, and Myrtle Avenue stops. According to Beat Nite curator and , co-founder ,, his goal this time around was to be more selective in choosing the participants in order to make the gallery crawl a manageable size for attendees, and to highlight certain newer galleries on the tour in order to build excitement and momentum into these new spaces.,While Jimarez-Howard chose participating galleries that were close enough together to encourage gallery-goers to make it to all ten locations, some people were expressing gallery fatigue midway through the night  and only made it to three or four of the spaces. However, the feedback from attendees was overwhelmingly positive, especially from those that were not familiar with some of the galleries before the event. At almost every venue I overheard excited Bushwickians viewing the crawl guide over absinthe-laced cocktails (Beat Nite’s signature drink), debating which way to go and which galleries they were most excited to visit. For those who missed out on the crawl, here is an overview of some of the nite’s highlights.,For many, the night began at ,. The gallery’s director and Beat Nite’s organizer, Jason Andrew, was buzzing around the gallery repping the gallery’s current show, , Drawings, open through February 24th.,As the homebase for the gallery crawl, the atmosphere was jovial and familiar. (Our , here.), kicked off their third exhibition, ,, on view until March 24th. , understated mechanical pencil drawings capture the simple and banal in an isolated and snapshot-like format. Thompson explained to me that he finds inspiration in everyday moments and objects, such as postcards, vintage books and even computer icons. Dozens of the artist’s intimate drawings were installed in a salon style hang on one wall of the gallery, while others remained neatly stacked in a pile, seemingly waiting to be installed. In the other corner, a flatscreen TV sat haphazardly on the floor, repeatedly playing Hallway, one of Thompson’s recent kinetic video collages. The exhibition generated an immediate understanding of the obsessive nature of the artist’s creation; as if he is trying to quantify the pluralism and oversaturation of images in popular culture and our everyday lives. Tip: make sure to peek inside the file cabinet, which stores even more of Thompson’s drawings., featured ,, a selection of works on paper from an , of both American and International artists, which is on view until February 24th. The show boasts a plethora of artists and works installed from floor to ceiling, including personal sketch books, intricate collage, detailed views of Parisian rooftops, colorful watercolor and many other works that exemplify the versatility of their medium. The gallery is also the home to ,, which showcases a selection of exhibition-specific books and printed material under the direction of Sonel Breslav., , offered something completely different: walls completely covered with blank sheets of paper ready to be decorated for the gallery’s , co-hosted by the gallery and ,. The gallery was busy preparing for their upcoming show to open March 9th, so this Drink and Draw event gave crawlers a chance to flex their own artistic skills and participate in a collaborative installation while, of course, sipping on a cocktail!,A short crawl around the corner, Beat Nite continued to , featuring Crumbling Cities, the first New York exhibition of street artist ,, which closed this past Saturday. Nether hails from Baltimore and aspires to use socially informed street art projects to provoke public forum and discussion. His large-format drawings depicting images of smiling children and Baltimore cityscapes are wheat pasted to blank walls on abandoned buildings, or in this case, onto wood board in the gallery space. Nether incorporates found objects, such as ribbons, housing advertisements, wood scraps and other detritus, that give depth to his two-dimensional depictions. They create a sense of place and have the effect of transforming the gallery into a street scene itself., ,From the streets of Baltimore, the next stop was ,, which transported viewers into the Heart of LULU, a performance, exhibition and dinner event. Fitting for the day after Valentine’s Day, OUTLET and artist , transformed the space into the crimson-lit depths of Lulu’s beating heart. Lulu explores the meaning and implications of relationships and romance, through the typical signifiers of love – largely based on actually googling “love.” Images of love, sex, lust and carnal desire inhabit the space, from the sugar-coated heart-shaped cookies to a video of sensuous disembodied lips. On the back wall of the gallery, Lulu busily scribbled participants’ names alongside her own in order to establish she and the viewer’s compatibility. (Turns out that Lulu and I are 99% compatible!), ,, the street art boutique turned gallery, offered another display of graffiti-inspired works from a group of artists who have been working together as a crew for twenty years. Entitled ,, the exhibition showcased the work of seven artists: Zeso, Bisc, Zimad, Meres, Bishop203, Leia, and Just1. The disparate works are presented on one side of the boutique, just as blocks of mural one might encounter on an actual street in Brooklyn or Queens. The exhibition showcased the maturation of these artists as they have each developed a unique style and adapted their techniques to fit a canvas. Low Brow Artique and the artists are all closely connected to , in Long Island City, where you can view other examples of the artists’ work ,.,Simply entitled , current exhibition features works by ,, ,, and ,. As the name would suggest, we were greeted at the entrance by Rachel Phillips and Charles Tisa, whose French salon,inspired space is open to artistic collaborations, performances, and discussion. While all three artists deal with expressions of identity and self, culture tradition and contemporary practices, Rivero’s , dominated the parlor with its scenic and dreamlike landscape., presented , by Amos Poe, which will be on view until March 18. Poe, who is better known as a filmmaker, writer and producer, makes his foray into painting with this debut. The works, all en grasaille, are fantastic abstract canvases reminiscent of stop-motion cinema. They possess a nostalgia that conjures images and recollections of early cinematic stalwarts like ,, ,, and German Dada artists like ,., presented ,exhibition. ,, ,, and ,‘s pieces perfectly contrast and complement to show a diversity in today’s painting. Playing with concepts of figure versus ground, abstraction versus representation, and painted versus real objects, the three artists come together harmoniously and represent a deep understanding of historical art movements such as ,and ,while still reinventing the medium. The bunker-like quality of the space adds to the underground and avant-garde feel to the entire experience – just make sure not to hit your head when entering the gallery.,The night’s successes were visible from the volume of gallery-goers and the general interest everyone paid to the various shows. While some might have been more familiar with the spaces than others, it was clear that there was something new and exciting for everyone who made the trek. The galleries involved in this edition of Beat Nite created an interesting melange of artistic inspirations, mediums and styles. Cohesiveness in its variation, along with surprises around every corner, contributed to a dynamic and thought-provoking evening for all involved, leaving us in anticipation for the next edition!","Allison Galgiani is a writer and fine arts professional from Tucson, AZ, and now lives in Bushwick.

"Arts and Culture,Featured","Bookworms rejoice! ,, a new library and reading room in Bushwick, will open its doors on Thursday, February 21 at 7PM with beers and impromptu readings. Book lovers can hang, drink and read, while members can check out books for a suggested donation of $20 for an annual membership. But don’t worry, there are also plenty of ways to get around the membership fee.,The new library is located in a 250-foot-square studio on 56 Bogart Street, and was co-founded by Bushwick residents and friends Matt Nelson and Jacob Perkins who are both originally from Seattle. Nelson, who moved to New York to do an MFA at Queens College, said he got the idea to start a library/reading room focusing on small press books from Pilot Books, a bookstore in Seattle which sold books published by independent presses before it ,.,“We don’t have a blueprint for what we’re doing. We just want a really good collection so that there’s more people using it and contributing to it,” Perkins said. “We know there are a lot of people interested in this type of thing.”,Nelson originally dreamed of moving back to Seattle and opening up the reading room there. But Perkins, a painter who is renting the studio, had begun painting less and writing more. “I felt the space was going to waste and the location is perfect, so I said, ‘Why don’t we just do it here?’” And so they did.,The collection is composed of the men’s own books, as well as the books from Perkins’ brother, who has a PhD from Duke University in global political theory. While the collection features more political books, than fiction and poetry, the men plan to expand the collection to feature more books published by small presses. That’s not to say they don’t already have a good selection of fiction or poetry – they most certainly do. Check out their full,.,“[The collection] is valuable, but we would like to outnumber the political stuff,” Perkins said.,The men hope that through donations, new members and reaching out to independent publishers they will fill the walls with more books. Nelson also plans to attend the , conference in Boston in March to meet with publishers and ask for donations.,“The big thing is to get people reading these books, because a lot of the smaller presses are not featured in bookstores in the area,” Nelson said. “Most bookstores in Bushwick are used, so they’re definitely not getting the newer smaller presses.”,The concept is also one of a kind in Bushwick, as well as the rest of the city. The closest ideas are ,, a poetry archive in Manhattan and Williamsburg’s ,, where members can look at sketchbooks from around the world.,The $20 membership allows you to check out one book at a time and keep it for as long as it takes you to read it, although they might draw the line at one month. Members are also entitled to coffee – and beer in the future. You can score a free membership by donating five books off the wish list or 10 books not on the list. But you have to be willing to write reviews for the books not on the list to donate them. The men also plan to host small literary readings and perhaps film screenings in the future.,“It’s all a big experiment. We’ll see what happens and what kind of excitement we can garner,” Nelson said. “Even if it’s just our friends hanging out, it’s a good thing.”,And if you’re wondering about how they came up with the name, Perkins said, “The reading room is small, but we’re hoping to create a mellow space.” They’re also loosely putting together a zine with the same name.,“It’s also funny because of the yellow pages,” Nelson added.,For more information send an email to , or follow them on ,.",,"56 bogart,bookstore,Jacob Perkins,Matt Nelson,mellow pages","

We sat down with him to talk about his current project.,The sketch group I work with, The Quanrudes, has made a number of shows in the past, but this is the first time I’ve written one on my own.,It started with a single sketch about FDR. A friend of mine had this idea of doing a comedy show called “That 1850’s Show”, as a satire of That 70’s Show. I wrote a few pieces on James Buchanan, who was a more obscure president, then I developed another sketch about slavery under Thomas Jefferson. Once I had those three I realized I had the beginnings of a full show.,
There were two challenges in the writing process. On one hand, some of the very well known presidents, such as Bill Clinton, have been thoroughly satirised before, so it was hard to come up with ‘new’ material. Then on the other hand, writing about the more obscure presidents meant that I had to write deliberately educational material when setting up the scene, to make sure everyone was on the same page.,Nine. I think we found a good balance. A sketch show has a lot of requirements. You need a good mix of gags, information, and gratuitous dance numbers. In the end I went with FDR, James Buchanan, William Taft, Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon, Abe Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson, JFK, and Thomas Jefferson.,I say I wrote it on my own but it was essentially a co-write between me and Wikipedia. It was a really fun process because I was constantly discovering new things. I mean, comedically, I discovered a way to build a dance act around Richard Nixon, for example, so that was new. But then in terms of the information, stuff just kept coming up, like the fact that Jimmy Carter was attacked by a swamp rabbit—that’s just plain fun.,The more wacky details you can fit into a scene, the funnier it is, so you can expect to pick up some bizarre pieces of trivia. You’ll get an insight into Jefferson’s personal life, see Nixon on a night off, and learn how Woodrow Wilson dealt with tabloid media. And you will finally finally finally learn the truth about JFK.

During her performance with the band CUM BLOOD, she changed outfits to a paint splattered, lace dress and made the performance even more entertaining by unzipping her dress and rolling around the floor. Her makeup changed for the evening, as she had her face covered with red face paint. I’ve always wondered how long it takes her to get the paint off. I suppose some things shall remain a mystery., ,BYO Fashion Night included performances by ,, ,, Fantastic Planet, Jacob Zeroro, and impromptu freestyle by a gentleman whose name I can’t recall. Dream Council’s performance was accompanied by a live painting by DMT. Their sound is slightly reminiscent of Cocteau Twins and you can hear the influences of Depeche Mode.,Following Dream Council’s performance was Jacob Zeroro, whose experimental scratching got the whole room’s attention.

									These 5 Bushwick Concerts Will Make You Happy!							",Maria Gotay,,
"Featured,Food and Drink","Whether you’ve jumped the turnstiles (not recommended, but we get it) or pony’d up for one last $104 monthly MetroCard before the fare hikes in March, the next L stop on this Drink & Ride gets you to Morgan – previously only a name you associated with girls who played high school field hockey. Luckily, there are enough new bars and old favorites near this stop to make your trip worth venturing a little further into Bushwick., With its bare bones, err, bare wood interior, it would be easy to dismiss , as yet another Brooklyn dive. Au contraire. The factory-like, rustic interior is a vegan’s paradise since all the booze is free from animal products, with the owner going so far as to make her own vegan versions of our favorite spirits. Taste and quality are never comprised; you’ll find favorites like Narraganset Lager ($5), Sixpoint Resin ($6), and Anchor Porter ($6) on tap, plus cocktails using ingredients like homemade pickle brine, candied ginger and Bosco syrup. On a lucky night, you’ll catch live music. On an “unlucky” night, you’ll have to satisfy your concert yen by studying the many tickets beneath the clear bar top, including stubs from LCD Soundsystem, Beastie Boys and John Cougar (Mellancamp, we hope). Before you go, make sure to look up at the mason jar lighting to see a creative use of Brooklyn’s favorite container., The so-good-it-can’t-be-vegan root-beer-float-like Sam in a Sweater ($10),Don’t let the name or iron crown outside fool you, there’s nothing royal about ,. Behind its purposely rusted metal façade, the spot’s hole-in-the-wall vibe thrives on the elegance of simplicity – you came to drink and mingle after a long day, so you better get down to it. There’s a basic selection of drafts (Guinness $6) and bottles (Chimay Blue $8), some “good” wine (as the bartender informed us with air quotes), and of course, a healthy collection of Scotch and Irish whiskey. Seating is relegated to thick wood tables and sturdy, so-high-we-had-to-jump bar stools, leaving enough room in the tight space for chatting up other bright, young Bushwickians. Light streams down from a few overhead lamps, each casting a candle-like glow perfect for drinking by yourself in a corner or trying to entice a pretty young thing to drink with you in a corner. The tattooed bartenders are fun, the crowd is attractively eclectic and, yes, there IS a jukebox., Simplicity reigns, so order the $5 combo of a Bud and shot of Jack, A nondescript sign marks this new addition to the Bushwick bar scene, making it seem less like an entrance to a 49,-state-themed bar and more like the neighbors put out a few chairs to do some people watching. Be careful not to make eye contact with the deer head behind the bar (he knows what you’re doing and he disapproves). The spacious interior has a farmhouse meets flea market aesthetic, with pastoral oil paintings decorating the walls and tables crafted by the owners themselves. , is the type of spot where ordering a bourbon and chatting up the bartender is not only encouraged, but expected. In addition to typically rustic spirits (i.e. whiskey and bourbon), there’s eight craft beers on draft to choose from, including Founders American Porter ($7), Sixpoint 3Beans Baltic Porter ($7) and Avery Ellie’s Brown Ale ($6)., Indulge in a boozy shake (no matter the temp outside) like the Bourbon Vanilla ($8),Housed behind the fluted glass windows of an inconspicuous Flushing Ave storefront, ,, an antidote from Bushwick dive bars, is reminiscent of a 1950s lounge, with a sleek, art deco design and appropriately dim lighting. Toast the Mad Men in your life with a selection from their list of draft beers, international wines and handcrafted cocktails with ingenious names like Babushka , a vodka-ginger-based libation ($8). Living up to its name, the narrow interior is dominated by a burnished metal bar, juxtaposed with tucked away booths you can easily imagine the Rat Pack idly lounging in while ordering stiff martinis. Dim, moody lighting completes the ’50s throwback vibe and a heated, wood-planked backyard deck lets you drink in the great outdoors year-round. They recently started offering dinner service and shellfish connoisseurs will be pleased to know they offer $1 oysters everyday ‘til 7pm. Cash only., Ward off the flu with a scotch-based Penicillin Cocktail ($10),A graffiti-heavy typical Bushwick dive that’s anything but typical – at least, that’s what we think Mrs. Doubtfire’s photo behind the bar is trying to tell us with her eyes.  With a Día,de los Muertos meets punk rock basement vibe, you’ll find typical subversiveness expected from this part of town in the faux crystal chandelier centered above mangled vinyl booths or the “Skate or Die” bumper stickers adorning the taps. The , cavernous space is home to pool tables, video games, $5 Tecates and a $6 Miller-and-whiskey special, easily recreating the kinds of joints you frequented in college – and luckily, the prices match. With willing-to-have-a-weird-conversation bartenders and a communal “let’s drink til it hurts” attitude, it’s the type of place where sobriety probably isn’t an option., Gear up for the next season with a Peak Organic Simcoe Spring ($6)","Writer, editor and sometime photographer.

The show had a lot of build-up with its indie star-studded bill, featuring members from ,, ,, and more. The venue quickly filled up with friends, fans, musicians and artists alike. It was one of those nights where you felt like you were right at home (if your home smelled like cigarette smoke, beer and sweat). It was kinda like a Super Bowl for new bands., a new Brooklyn band, opened up the evening with their first show ever! Brady Keehn, Beau Croxton and Timothy Fiore make up this darkwave, noise pop band. Some of their influences include ,, ,, ,, and ,. The crowd made their way to the stage as the trio drew them in with eerie vocals and guitars. The experimental goth band is currently working an LP with Daniel Schlett (who’s worked with ,, , and ,) at Strange Weather Recording Studio.,Next up was ,, a new project by members of ,. Lesley Hahn (of ,), Jeremy Cox and Jigmae Baer (the former drummer for , and ,) also made their debut performance among friends. While watching the band play, I couldn’t help but think of , and ,- an excellent mesh of artists from two different eras. They definitely bring a familiar, but fresh sound to the Bushwick music scene. With songs like “Bad Heart Part 2″ and “Big Sleep for Alice” it was like travelling back to the ’60s and ’70s to the days of garage rock and psychobilly. If you couldn’t make Lodro’s or Night Visions’ first show, check them out at ,!,Following Lodro was ,, a new band from Tacoma, Washington. Isaac Solverson (who attends Bard) is lead guitarist and vocalist and writes the songs, while Brad Oberhofer (of ,), Shane Weeks (of ,) and Patrick Johnson give killer support on guitar, drums and bass in all out noisy grunge pop fashion.,By the time the three opening bands finished playing, Shea was packed. The smell of cigarettes filled the air and laughter and smiles were everywhere as ,took the stage. With a smoke machine, some super awesome heavy guitar riffs brought to you by David Tassy and vocalist Tucker Rountree, Emily on bass and vocals, and Zoë Brecher slaying the drums, everyone was dancing. The great thing about Total Slacker, a local psychedelic punk band, is that they always fuel the audience with a plethora of energy. It was an exciting show, as they played some new songs off their upcoming album that they just finished working with Daniel Schlett.,was the last to take the stage. Never a disappointment, Brad and his band delivered in the most upbeat, adorable way possible. With buoyant, carefree lyrics and playful, catchy harmonies, the whole room was shaking their butts and bopping around. This neo-psych indie dance pop band was a great ending to the night and an excellent alternative to the Super Bowl.

The accident took place around 8:10AM at the corner of Myrtle and Wilson. All injuries aboard the school bus were minor, but the driver of the car is in serious but stable condition. The crash ignited tensions about the professionalism of non-union buses, as many school buses have been still on strike for over a month.,The city school buses strike, due to a dispute with the Department of Education (DOE), began on January 16th and has been huge inconvenience for parents and children citywide. The strike effects transport of 152,000 students, including 54,000 with disabilities. Parents have , with the strike, but no bid has been settled upon yet. Thus, parents have turned to non-union busses for their transportation needs. But is this unreliable and even dangerous?

Arts and Culture,"I weaved my way to the entrance, the lower level of a residential apartment building, trying not to step on the massive yellow lab standing sentinel at the front door. I glided past the waistcoated bartender with his melting bowl of ice and lonely bottle of cheap vodka that outlasted its mixers. I waited for him to wash out a few plastic cups that he happily filled with the remaining drudges of white wine and helped myself to a few Hershey’s Hugs that seemed out of place in the setting. Any feeling of pretense or discomfort dissolved as I went deeper into the gallery space and started focusing on the art present at the exhibition opening for ,., is one of those iconic artists who, like , and ,, has become stalwart relics of a modernist age of artistic production by which any artist working today can easily say that they have been influenced. Giacometti’s , are easily recognizable and, in their time, stood as existential reminders of the horrors of World War II and the alienation of individuals in a modern world. In contemporary times, this trope of one becoming distanced from the world around us is all too familiar as our lives are further and further mediated by technology, namely the lack of human connection that comes from the rise of the internet and social media. Yet through the seemingly dark and dreary imagery there remains a sense of humanity that these figures possess; it makes look inward on our own way of life as we look outward toward the imagery he created. The stubborn humanity and personality that can be seen in Giacometti’s sculpture, paintings and drawings, like his , (c.1947-1950), featured in the Norte Maar exhibition, which through its juxtaposition with the various contemporary drawings proves to be timeless and undying.,The exhibition features ten contemporary artists, most of whom work in Bushwick, pand roves to be just as interesting as many of the actual characters in the gallery the night of the opening. Lively and invigorating as the night was, most of the pieces possessed a similar sobriety to the Giacometti by which they were all so inspired. The two self-portraits by artist ,, for example, capture a similar obsession with capturing the essence of the subject “until it resembled….the living presence perceived at one glance of the model,” as explained by the artist in the label next to the drawing. His emphasis is in capturing the concept or zeitgeist of the sitter, in this case himself, rather than an exact physical likeness.,
This plays directly into Giacometti’s understanding of the human spirit. His figures are at once anonymous, lacking any sort of description as to their identity, yet possess a familiar and striking universality. This is by far the most telling theme throughout the show, as with other artists such as , , (2012), who takes the identity of his subject further by denying the viewer a clear sexual designation. Michelli’s tendency to continue his drawing from one page to another, held together by push pins also adds to the artifice of the piece of paper on which he draws, clearly proving that his goal is not to draw an exact physical rendering of a subject.,Other themes that permeated the show dealt with Giacometti’s constant play between substance and void, light and dark, and good and bad. These dualities that are so commonly felt across generations and national borders that they continue to prove relevant with this group of artists. I was especially struck by , drawings, whose obsessive halting lines create both a ground and void between them as they comprise a whole. By contrast, , presents his own concept of space by layering thin sheets of paper on top of one another creating a complex and non-definitive ground. ,, one of the two women in the show, also challenges the viewer to perceive space, light, and dark in a different way. Her drawings, created from producing and reproducing the same shape in graphite, then cutting and reassembling the paper to create a new shape, seem to be completely black. Upon closer inspection, however, we can see the lines and shapes that Hartle has meticulously worked to recreate., ,In this exhibition, Norte Maar presents a mature and thought-provoking dialogue between contemporary drawing and Giacometti’s mid-century oeuvre. Giacometti’s uncanny ability to toe the line between so many dichotomies - light and dark, material and space, figuration and abstraction, good and evil – will likely ring true for generations to come.,will be on view at Norte Maar until February 17. Norte Maar is open weekends from 1-6pm and is located at 83 Wyckoff Avenue, #1B.  Check out also out , with Norte Maae co-founder, Jason Andrew, on the origins of the gallery.","Allison Galgiani is a writer and fine arts professional from Tucson, AZ, and now lives in Bushwick.

Mind and Body,"Here is a formula for how to create and have more of something you desire in 5 easy steps, with a very unusual method for getting it: ritual design. This is a recipe and ritual for how to receive more, and it is a living, breathing, active biology of how to receive more. Yes, my dear, receiving is an action. To receive and to have are not the same as to be passive. Our culture teaches us a lot about how to give, how to take, achieve, do, and accomplish, but not so much about how to receive. Your capacity to receive is your yin, or feminine craft of healing and having, which ideally balances your yang energy form of giving. It’s a law of nature to have both within every living being. I’m going to give you the formula for having more of what you want, like a recipe, with 5 key ingredients:,The first key ingredient is ,. Get grateful for what you have now. How can you express your gratitude for the relationships and situations you have in your life that are working right now? Rituals of Gratitude can include but are not limited to: gifts, acknowledgements, words of appreciation, and acts of service.,When we get grateful and express our gratitude, it calls us to be present. Gratitude centers and grounds us in the present moment to all that is good about what is already happening. In essence, you are creating the landing space, the “stickiness”, and the traction for more of what you want to take hold. Your new more desired experiences and outcomes will “bond” to what is already happening that you like.  Gratitude and appreciation for what you like and approve of now is much more powerful then most of us realize. It calls our attention to the glimmers of what we would like more of, what already exists in the present moment. These moments then become the interface to having more of what you want from your most desired future outcome. Try this on this week and stay tuned for the second key ingredient next week.","Emily Tepper is Ritual Designer & Owner, Bushwick Pilates.","Emily Tepper,receive,rituals","

The site reported that there were 26 accidents involving a cyclist at Flushing and Broadway Avenues from 1995 to 2009, the most in Brooklyn and the eighth most in the city.,Local guide David Naczycz said that the area’s former identity as a brewery hub caused the traffic problems in the present day.,“What you have in Williamsburg and Bushwick is a 19th century city plan,” said Naczycz, who co-founded , in 2009 and often leads its “,” walking tour. “The problem is that you have a boom in both industrial and residential demand.”,The history of Brooklyn transportation was far from people’s minds when they gathered at Stewart and Metropolitan Avenues to remember Terence Connor at a candlelight vigil three days after the accident. Tassy said almost one hundred friends, family and acquaintances paid their respects.,“It was really overwhelming,” said Tassy, who donated his bike to serve as a permanent memorial at the accident scene. “Part of me wanted to be sad, but it was so beautiful how many people were there.”,Attendees noticed that the warehouse at 1202 Metropolitan Ave is equipped with a video camera that should have captured the accident. Though , reported that the camera was a “dummy,” rumors about it persist.,Neither the owner of the building, 47 Bridgewater Corp, nor the attorney listed on ,, June Liu, would clarify whether it’s a working camera.

You can either chill in one of the spacious leather booths in the front or you can go wild on the dance floor in the back.,The fact that Bossa Nova never charges a cover, nor has any dress code, makes the club even more amazing and accesible.

A few on the outs with the same love. And a few of a little , singing with some red wine and tears.,The past couple of years moving to Bushwick, I have found my inner peace with it. It is not a death sentence, nor a badge of your stability. It is a chance of putting yourself out there. Because in the truest form of high self-esteem and self-love, “If you don’t love yourself, how in the hell you gonna love somebody else?”…Can I get an amen?,Do these things by yourself and own it. Because your next ex might be watching.,If there is one place where you don’t need to be in a couple but still feel loved, it is Body Actualized, a yoga studio, event space and occasional orgy hub (yes, you heard me). It seems that for Valentine’s Day they didn’t plan an orgy but there will be a kamasutra kissing booth, intimacy exercises, and DJs and performances. Additionally, look forward to a delish menu (raw cheese cake, truffles, brownies and elixir drinks). Yum and kiss!,Cobra Club, a bar and a yoga studio, is totally skipping Valentine’s Day goofiness, and is celebrating Lupercalia instead. “Lupercalia was celebrated from February 13-15th. Wolves, flagellation, and blood sacrifice,” says the invitation. Additionally, there will be DJs, gift bags and drink specials.,Grab that mic, The Kings Of Karaoke will take care of the rest. Sing your heart out and celebrate with friends!,Only one thing is lamer than dating – speed dating, thinks our fav bar Tandem. So why not trying something completely crazy like Experimental Speed Dating. What the hell? The invitation says: “We will rotate through various pairings of people: Three minutes per pairing (much like conventional speed dating). But, here’s how it’s different: For each 3-minute segment you and your partner will be presented with an instruction that you must follow (for example: talk in a foreign accent or only tell stories about when you were 6-12 years old or close your eyes while you speak, etc). The instructions will change with every rotation. Everyone will have the opportunity to choose their preferred gender of the evening. Also, you don’t even have to be single to attend (although you may end up breaking some hearts).”,If you don’t love anyone, you gotta love House of Yes on Valentine’s Day!

"Featured,Food and Drink","Our beloved coffee spot, is hosting its first free, open-to-the-public, coffee cupping event this coming Tuesday, February 12 at 6PM! The patrons will have an opportunity to try a variety of coffees, and to learn a little more about the qualities that make their brew exceptional! We sat down with the Little Skips’ Coffee Specialist, Sean Sullivan to chat about what we can expect on Tuesday.,
Yeah, we’re really excited about it! It’s going to be a very laid-back affair. I really don’t like when people think of coffee cupping and they instantly think of some sort of pretentious ceremony – it’s really quite simple. We’re just going to get together and taste some really good coffee and talk about what you taste and how you taste it. You can expect to walk away knowing a little bit more about coffee and understanding what goes into a really good cup.,
They’re pretty similar, yeah. Again, people may have the idea that it’s something ceremonious. But really, we’re just going to grind coffee, smell coffee, put some hot water in it, smell it some more and try it. This is how professionals get to know a cup of coffee to get a baseline for the flavor profile, how it tastes – the “notes”, if you will. Unlike a wine tasting, you don’t get drunk, but there is going to be spitting involved. Hopefully no one will be shy about spitting. There’s a cup for it. It’s all going to be set up at the bar, as a round table discussion where we all explore the coffee at the same time. The more we get into it, the more people will learn.,
Well, we’re definitely going to Africa. There are going to be three different coffees, and they’re all going to be of African origin. Hopefully this is going to be the first in a series of cuppings at which we’re going to “go around the world” – so that when you go into a cafe and the barista tells you “this is an African” you have an idea of what might be in that cup flavor-wise and can compare it to other coffees. Not too long ago, most people thought of coffee as something from Dunkin Donuts, or from a bodega. We’ve been here for a while and we figure it’s time to reach out and get the community to know and love coffee as much as us, and to broaden our general idea of what coffee is and where it comes from.,
Yeah, exclusively. Our baristas are all trained by Counter Culture and all the coffee, every single bean of coffee that we serve, is from Counter Culture. Counter Culture helped get this cafe where it is, and we’re really happy to have such a good relationship with them.,Yes, everything from art shows to music shows or just parties to get everyone in the community together. That’s really where Skips comes from: it’s completely community-oriented. We try to maintain that as much as we can, especially with new people moving in and old people moving out. Our customer base has changed a lot, and we have a lot more people coming in here now. It’s become a little bit more of a hustle to keep up with everyone, but we still want to know everyone on a first-name basis and to be involved in everything that’s happening around us.,

We saw both promising bands at ,, and were caught off guard with the level of sheer intensity.,Last Friday I strolled into the jam-packed attic venue in time to be sucked into the world of none other than ,There’s not much to say about this band except “Dammit, they are intense!” Mixing drone and psychedelic rock, their music is an endless but hyper-attentive round of pounding rhythms and etched-in melodies and, simply, a LOT of noise.  Their set began and the noise of the crowd disappeared. Everyone was entranced in the energy of Guardian Alien and the commitment they made to their stage performance.,It was hard to really comprehend anything during their set, which started and didn’t settle down until it was over and my ears were ringing. I simply fell into the slices of the complicated drum beats, which circled and evolved, elevating the rest of the musicians with it. The vocalist sand into aNevermind the fact that the drummer, Greg Fox, who used to play in ,(Brooklyn’s Black Metal Band), ,. The band also featured an instrument I’d never laid eyes on, a sort of modified steel lap guitar called a ,, that featured both string and keys, made incredible noises, and is only really heard otherwise in Hebrew music and Indian techo.  Hah!,Guardian Angel is the love project of , and 4 other kindred spirits who somehow found a common passion for loud, cyclical, drone rock psychedelia, with cosmic overtones. Although at the time I thought their performance was one of the strangest I’ve subjected myself to lately, I also felt strongly connected to their unique sound.,Eventually, , arrived with a sweet, huge, decorative boombox back set. Javelin is a fun and satisfying dance/rock band who are a joy to see in person. With live (and really intense) drumming and fun instrument props, like a kazoo, these guys always get the party started. In fact, the crowd was having so much fun it almost seemed like we could start up a congo line or something. Almost.,Javelin’s been off the grid lately, and for good reason: they’ve been recording their new album, ,, which is coming out March 5th and whose single “Nnormal” you can stream below! Their sound has evolved dramatically over the past few years. Less of the hip-hop influence and a crazy amount of sampling on 2009/10 era, to create really catchy and smart pop hooks that you could dance to all night. They’ve moved to a more mature sound, one that’s semi-apparent on 2011′s , and even more in their new songs, based on original hooks and a breed of super-pop that’s ecstacy-laced and really pure gold.,Javelin’s a big name to play at Shea, and they were reveling in the sweaty, crammed venue, practically playing in the pit. I was seriously tempted to hop on stage when a few of their addicting concert staples, like “Vibrationz”, started playing. They gave the show 100% and, besides the occasional flat note, the show was one big party., ",strict rule breaker. photographer. music obsessee. brooklynite.,"awesome,crazy,drone,guardian alien,javelin,pop,rock,Shea Stadium","

In the Hood,"Throw Something – but not at a person. Throw an object symbolic of what you wish to release into a field, an ocean, or abyss of your choice. If this makes you concerned about littering, throw the symbolic object into a garbage dumpster or compost pile of choice. The action of throwing something with your body provides your nervous system and your somatic memory with the experience of releasing and propelling “something” away from you. In woo-woo terminology, this cleans your energy of clinging and gripping onto specific results. It clears you and makes you receptive to the best and highest possible outcome, which might be even better than whatever you are trying to force into existence. In quantum science or epigenetic language, you are acting out with your own nervous system what you want so that your mind and body can sync up. Either way, it works. Have you ever turned on a computer or a light without knowing EXACTLY how it works? Designed Rituals work the same way.,Actions with a specific intention in mind elevate your action into designed experience and ritual. It marks a shift in your perspective. We already co-create our lives moment to moment in exactly this way. Elevating your actions to ritual gives you the clarity you need to decide what you are moving away from, and what you call in. To put down the old and unnecessary, you must release attachment to outcomes you are trying to force.,The photo above was taken during a ritual that several ritual clients at , have gotten great results from. Here is how to do one release ritual for yourself: Create an installation inside a bottle that symbolizes the goodness and beauty you are attached to and possibly forcing (like finding love on a fixed timeline or feeling like someone else has to love you in a certain way - whatever results you are forcing). Then, take a Wintertime stroll by the body of water of your choice (this client went to the Ocean at the Far Rockaways.)  Speak your intention to release your attachment out loud. “I release control over forcing this timing!” “I release control of who my true love will be and when we will find each other!!!”  “I release attachment to what effect my art has on the viewer!!!” “I release my attachment to this business proposal working out!!” Then throw the bottle away from you and release it into the ocean!,The result is a door opening inside you to something new. By releasing attachment to what you cling to, you have now created space for the best possible outcome to flow into your life without your limiting clingy thoughts getting in the way! Congratulations! Try it out and let me know below how it goes for you. I would love to hear.

Arts and Culture,"Wandering into , off of a snow-dusted Forrest Street is a moment demanding to be experienced right now. Having grown accustomed to bright lights, white walls and winter doldrums I was initially taken aback by the somber back room of the gallery. Through the doorway, one can see only a fraction of three fantastic floating sculptures created by artist and costume designer ,.,Pass into that room and the sculptures double in size from what you originally perceived. On initial inspection it seems that three wedding dresses have been ripped, stained, and coated in resin for the effect of a mind-boggling transformation. A second pass reveals the intensity of these actions and the care given to the subjects of the transformation. Being that the exhibition promotes repeated examinations, different items and moments of exaltation will poke and prod at your consciousness.,Taking the description of intent out of context: “The evocative, draping forms in Seufferlein’s work capture the colliding moment of beautiful optimism met with daunting pessimism.” reminds me of lines 7 & 8 of Yeats’s ,.,The best lack all conviction, while the worst,Are full of passionate intensity.,is a work of contrasts. Tacked handkerchiefs move slightly when the front door is opened, while tiny A-Shirts remain flat against the wall in frames. The ultimate destruction of these wedding dresses is their preservation. A bride is clad in this “symbol of bliss” for such a short amount of time, limited to one occasion. The clothes themselves are indeed more symbolic than anything else.

I have seen over and over how my female artists friends who have been in situations, when dating or otherwise, of being judged negatively on a personal level by their work and their willingness for exposing themselves. My personal guess is that men see these women as too aggressive and not feminine (passive?) enough.  Paradoxically, quite often, these are the women that are the most traditional, even conservative in their lifestyles.,To explore this quandary, I bring you an interview that I did with artist Ann Hirsch. Ann is a performance artist who might seem to lack personal boundaries in her work but when you meet her she one the nicest, sweetest and borderline shyest people you might run into around here. Naked in public, but not even a low-cut shirt or eyeliner in life! I also think that her being normal (read highly functional) is what allows her to be productive with her talents and maintain a healthy, satisfying, long-term relationship with her boyfriend.,Let me tell you a bit about Ann’s work, so you can see what I mean about putting ones self out there in a sexually/emotionally vulnerable way. At one point in her performance art career, she stopped just short of selling videos of herself. As she states below here in this interview, , Ann has worked as a ,, as well as being ,. Currently she is doing work that involves her,. ,A lot of it just stems from some kind of middle school obsession that I never conquered. I was so consumed with being a good Jewish student back then that I never took the time to figure out femininity. Like how is a girl “supposed” to look and act to get what she supposedly wants? I was pretty clueless about all that stuff so once I hit my twenties I was kind of like, well I better figure this stuff out now, I’m way behind everyone else here. That morphed into my artistic practice because I realized there was a disconnect between what I was, how I felt I should be, and what I desired., Sometimes I think my work is insanely masochistic. I do the most embarrassing/humiliating things I can possibly think of so that I can get over shit I feel ashamed about. It’s like my own brand of exposure therapy I’ve made up to lessen my anxieties. When I started performing as Scandalishious, I was hesitant to present myself as a “sexual object” because I thought people wouldn’t take me seriously. Trying to be sexy on the internet in more than 100 videos helped me realize I don’t need to feel ashamed of being a sexual person. That my intellect was not lessened by also trying to appear sexy.,More recently, after doing a few nude performances, I stopped worrying so much about how my body looks to others on a day-to-day basis. I was like, well, a couple hundred people by now have jus,t seen everything! I guess the biggest difference in my life is that I’ve stopped wearing a bra. I used to be so self-conscious about the way my breasts looked or if you could see my nipples and now I don’t give a shit. I don’t want the way I feel about my physical appearance to determine how I go about my life.,I think mostly it is people within the art world actually who misperceive me because of my work. It’s like, if I show someone my Scandalishious work or my reality TV work, I also have to try to prove that I’m a “smart, thoughtful” artist or some bullshit like that. A few professors in grad school told me I was “too smart” to be making the kind of work I was making. I’ve had an artist peer of mine ask me to contribute an online project for his blog but ultimately have him reject it because I didn’t explain in an academic way enough how that certain project was art. On the flip side, I’ve had art people just dismiss my work because it’s too “feminist” and feminism is like over or something.,As far as non-art, or “regular” people, it depends what they’ve seen of me. I have been on the show ,on the Science Channel a few times, so people who know me from that think I am a huge nerd. People who have only seen my Scandalishious work think I’m an attention whore and people who have seen me on , think I’m some nice, pathetic lovelorn puppy. I guess I’m all those things but, because of the nature of the media, I could only show one side at a time. My goal is that by constantly showing all these different sides, some kind of holistic version of myself will appear., It depends how much I let it. When I was doing Scandalishious, at one point the work was headed in a dark direction, where I was considering making nude videos and selling them to anonymous men in the name of ART, but my boyfriend at the time flipped out so I never really went quite as far with that part of the project as I had intended to. I think most of my crazy “exploring my sexuality” days are over so it’s not much of an issue anymore. Although I do try to be attuned to my boyfriend’s feelings as much as possible while still pursuing the things I need to. There are certain sacrifices you need to make sometimes so that you can have a healthy personal life. But I think that goes for any artist who is dedicated to their work.,Not really. But that could also be because I am pretty dismissive of people who are overly judgmental (read: if people don’t like me I usually don’t like them either). Also, I think there is an element of play and lightheartedness to my work that people enjoy and that makes it fairly accessible.,AH: Mainly I think men shouldn’t be so scared of feminism. This goes for “edgy” and “non-edgy” guys. Feminism isn’t just for women anymore! It’s for men too. There’s a lot of burden on men to be super masculine, to be good financial providers, to hide their emotions. I can see how breaking out of the mold of masculinity could be scary for a guy but, ultimately, hopefully freeing.,I can’t afford to. Otherwise I’d be miserable. If there is something I’ve done that has made me uncomfortable as I look back at it, I just figure out a way to turn it into something interesting within my larger artistic narrative.,My boyfriend who is a creative writer, is proud of me for getting nude in my performance works. He mainly wants me to take risks and be vulnerable in my work, as do I. We both agree that’s the most important thing you can do as an artist so he is proud of me after I take off my clothes and fart with my leg pits or something like that.,We work well together because we’re very similar people. We’re both conservative on the outside and strange on the inside. So we like to be traditional in our day-to-day but in our artwork that is where we both allow ourselves to explore our more unusual side.  We appreciate each other for our eccentricities. But the fact that we both came from super loving and mainly normal functioning families helps us be a strong couple., ,My advice is probably the same as it would be for any woman. Be yourself, follow your dreams and do your thing. All men are attracted to that.

In the Hood,"They say there’s an audience for everything. But perhaps this excludes the scatological renderings of Bushwick resident Jonathan Mittiga. Last year Mittiga read a “repulsive” short story that didn’t go down well with the audience and was told, “You can’t read that stuff here,” by the reading’s organizer and was never invited back to read. “[The story] was about gross things. I didn’t realize at the time that it wasn’t a gross out contest,” Mittiga said. “I was simply writing for an audience of myself.”,Rather than cry, feel like a complete failure, get drunk and swear off writing altogether—as perhaps many of us would’ve done—Mittiga and roommate James Sprang launched the , (BRG) series last October at , in Williamsburg. The reading happens every last Sunday of the month at 8PM to unsuspecting customers and people trying to study (good luck with that).,“I wanted a place that was not discriminating against fledging writers who are writing things that are off the cuff and reading stuff that isn’t ‘mainstream,’” Mittiga said of his motivation for starting the series. “I think the small group of people I’ve put together, including myself, have a distinct flavor to differentiate us from other reading groups.”,The BRG is open to everyone and all genres are welcome, including short stories, poems and performance pieces. One previous BRG member read a piece detailing the stories of the individual shrunken heads that now make up a string of anal beads, while another member’s drunken ramblings became his performance. Mittiga’s own poems make lots of references to shit—both actual and metaphorical.,“I didn’t realize how much shit was in my poems until I read them out loud,” Mittiga said of his last reading in January.,Still other readers deal with issues of everyday life, strange dreams, heartbreak and relationships. Mittiga says there are no requirements to read, nor need to be repulsive, but having some shit in the pieces couldn’t hurt.,Mittiga, who is originally from Long Island and studied new media, said he wrote his first short story about a year ago to impress a girl. Ultimately, Mittiga decided he didn’t like the story and didn’t show it to the young lady, but he continued writing and began submitting work to several journals.,Mittiga writes in various genres, including poetry and short stories, and is now in the process of writing a novel, which he plans to complete a first draft by the end of the year. The novel’s working title is “From Supple to Crusty,” and is about a woman, who was conceived during an S&M gangbang, searching for her father.,Mittiga admits BRG is still establishing itself as it works to secure committed readers. He also acknowledges the fact that BRG doesn’t currently take place in Bushwick as the name might suggest, but he aims to change that in the future either by moving to Bushwick or changing the name of the group.,“My friends might have the same interests and tastes as me in terms of writing, but they’re not as reliable or forthcoming,” he says of the challenges he’s faced so far. “So I hope to find like-minded people who want to read as well.”, ",,"bushwick reading group,jonathan mittiga,the west bar,williamsburg,writers","

Fashion & Shopping,"Just when I thought the Barbershop was going the way of the Dodo, one opens up in Bushwick. ,, located off the Morgan L stop on Flushing Ave, has opened its doors to the public, which means all you unkempt Bushwick dudes have no excuses left!,We chatted with Danny Baptista, the man behind the endeavour, about the state of hipster facial hair and correlation between a haircut and manliness. We found out that there’s more to a haircut than just a pair of scissors.,A well-groomed man, who looks his best, is ready to take on any situation. Pride in one’s presentation is important.,I believe there is a correlation between a haircut and manliness. Men should go to barbershops as their grandfathers did, not unisex shops or salons. A barbershop is the ultimate men’s social club and we should not allow that tradition to die. It’s not a trend; it is part of being a man. You go, and you take your son, and then years later, he does the same. It is part of manly culture and tradition.,There are a lot of barbers and hairdressers in my family. My grandfather cut hair in the Cape Verde Islands. As a kid growing up I cut hair for my friends and family. I owned a barbershop inside my skate shop in the ’90s. I finally got my NY master barber’s licence and started practicing legally eight years ago.,We opened here on the 1st of November last year. I was in the back room inside Post Bikes for three years before that.,We certainly do get walk-ins but, to be honest, we prefer appointments. But if someone drops in off the street we do our best to accommodate him.,Yes. If they’re thirsty! We offer all our clients cold Tecate or Modello, as part of the deal.,Originally I got the first two Koken President chairs from an old man in Connecticut who was closing up shop. Since the new space was bigger, I expanded to a three-chair shop and the hunt began for a third matching chair. I was emailing people from Internet ads that were literally five years old in the hope they would still have the chair. The ’80s skateboard decks and framed tattoo flash are all mine that I’ve acquired over time. The station cabinets came in from a wholesaler in Wisconsin; they came from a 1940s hospital originally.,Elvis Presley had fantastic hair. But that’s too easy. I would say Robert Deniro’s charcter Sam Rothstein in Casino had it down. Cab Calloway also had great hair and style.,I don’t think the beard is going away any time soon. More and more women like it, so that’s the real anchor. Speaking personally, I wore a beard at various lengths for the last eighteen years and I think it looks great. It’s a manly look and with a great haircut it’s good to go. I think where guys go wrong, and I’ve been guilty of this is the past, is not grooming the neck beard, going for the “father time” look. You don’t have it right when you have a young handsome face and a Santa Claus beard. Big beards can certainly look good when they are groomed. I try to school guys on that. I personally grew tired of wearing a beard when I started to look like everybody else around here. I shaved it off and rocked the skinny mustache. I’m bringing back the mustache for now. I’m sure the beard will take hold of my soul once again…,I like Clem’s or Lone Wolf.

"Featured,Food and Drink","Sometimes it seems like our whole live revolves around the L train – a harrowing fact considering most of us have either been cursed out by a sassy teenage girl or seen someone strip down to their skivvies during the long commute home. After rides like those (or, let’s be honest, any subway ride), all we want, all we need is a stiff drink. Which is why we’re depleting our MetroCards to round up the best bars within steps of each L stop in Bushwick. Let’s start at the Montrose stop, where we can toast (or curse) the MTA at these five within-walking-distance bars.,This new kid on the block opened in August, attempting to seduce locals with 18 rotating taps (pouring $5-$8 brews), cozy booths, dim lighting, and typically quirky BK décor like a bronzed Roman helmet, mismatched vintage lamps, and a large fish sculpture that looks like it’s ready to dance (probably during the DJ-ed dance parties on Thursday and Saturday nights). Aiming to be a neighborhood spot, , cuts $2 off any drink during their daily happy hours which go ‘til 8pm …just enough time to throw back a few post-work drinks and get home in time to watch Downton Abbey.,: The thick-as-a-blanket Ithaca Gorges Smoked Porter ($6),Housed in a converted garage, , expanded to 2x its original 2006-era size, offering more than just the opportunity to make a few fowl-related puns. The décor’s irony factor is high, with a mix of tongue-in-cheek art, mismatched sofas, and a winding ceiling staircase to nowhere. But let’s focus on the important stuff: alcohol. Along with their infamous beer and shot specials (ex: the Dirty Sanchez, a Modelo Especial + shot of tequila, $6), they also pour seasonal cocktails ($8-$10), craft beers ($5-$7) and the classics, including a killer Moscow Mule ($8). Happy hour is seven days a week… a waste since you only work five. Cash only.,: Hot cider spiked with rum or bourbon ($8) or a “Hot Roddy,” a hot toddy made with spiced ginger rum ($8),No need to break out your woodworking tools to appreciate the rustic vibe of this ,. It’s a spot where you can simply drink like you’re meant to drink, with twelve American craft beers on tap, classic cocktails, and a selection of spirits from local distilleries. Grab a drink at the 17-foot-long white oak bar or sneak into a cozy alcove enclosed by exposed wooden walls. The vibe is laid back, happy hour lasts ‘til 9pm and warm weather will call for drinking a Coney Lager ($6) outdoors on their patio…the ideal end to any work day. Cash only.,: Seasonal beers from local Brooklyn Brewery ($5) and Kelso Beer Co ($5),Opening as soon as the weather’s warm enough, , boasts 60 beers on tap, 250 bottles, and a fully stocked bar, providing plenty of much-needed liquid relief after a long day. Half outdoor beer garden (The Well) and half indoor drinking hall (The Wick, not yet open), it’s housed in the former Hittleman Brewery, once part of the historic Brewer’s Row. On warm summer nights, you’ll find events like “Bike-In Movies”, indie music concerts (like last September’s Ty Segall & Thee Oh Sees) and straight-up dance parties…a well known stress reliever. Cash only.,: Belgium’s Hof ten Dormaal Winter 12 or Denmark’s Evil Twin Bikini (for drinking while dreaming of summer),Behind the somewhat forbidding metal-barred windows, this small, unassuming cocktail joint packs a lot of warmth into a narrow space. Sidle up to the long, burnished metal bar to order from a simple menu, consisting of four draft beers, 15 bottles, and classic cocktails done right (including a very stiff Dark & Stormy, $8).

The owner of Molasses, Matt, told us that he will be serving $2 beers and “playing Springsteen records while attempting (and probably failing) to stream the game on two tiny Macbooks.” If the Super Bowl screening fails, or if Beyonce gets on your nerves, you can always grab a book and keep on sipping beer like it’s any other Sunday.,Our super-fav Ridgewood gallery Small Black Door has prepared something really awesome! That is a fusion of art and sports, naturally. Starting at 4PM, they will present an art show inspired by “everything right and wrong in sports, art and contemporary American Culture: heroics, mythology, aesthetic, spectacle, money, violence, sexism, drugs, and death.” The art show will be followed by the spectacular Super Bowl XLVII game, exhibition and performances. See ya at the Small Black Door stoop, everyone!,If you’re looking for a more traditional place to spend your Super Bowl, we know of an awesome, cozy bar that has a flatscreen and happy hour starting at 6PM ending at 8PM (woohoo!). Additionally, they will be serving delicious chili for $9 with any draft beer. Naturally, Beyonce fans will be treated with equal love. Check out Miles on Wilson Ave!,At Heavy Woods they believe that nothing is more appropriate than football and Cajun food. Additionally, they will honor their patrons with $12 buckets of Bud. Just like you used to do in college.,God knows that the best part of the Super Bowl is the puppies. Or kittens. In any case, if you’re a fan these adorable little clumsy creatures, you should go to Alaska because they will be rooting for labs as well. They are promising chicken wings, lotsa beer and deer heads on the wall (as usual). Cheers to puppies!, ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

Beneath the beautiful cloth-cloud installation known as one of Glasslands’ iconic art pieces, the stage was lit up by Merrie Cherry’s gorgeous, flowing red gown. To the right of the stage, the talented DJ Anthony Dicapua kept the music in sync, entertaining and on point throughout the entire night. As Murray Hill facetiously noted, “We’re in a warehouse with Christmas lights! This is the big time!” Everyone in attendance dressed to stun. Ensembles ranging from virtually nothing at all to layers and layers of fur, designer jackets, studs, feathers, rhinestones, masks, makeup, metal, and even cardboard formed an idyllic landscape of the diversity of styles in and around Brooklyn.,According to the Facebook fan page, the BNAs “… are meant to support and represent the night life industry in Brooklyn, a boro [sic] that has grown enormously in the last five years. With this growth in population, the night life industry has grown as well – but continues to lack acknowledgement. The BNA Awards will attempt to bring this aspect of Brooklyn to life by highlighting personalities and the creative individuals that wake at night and bring entertainment to the masses.”,The performances by Ab Soto, Horrorchata, Krystal Something Something, Zebra Baby, and Di Ba were flawlessly representative of the grungy, risqué and artistic feel of the Brooklyn Nightlife while merging those attributes with the production quality befitting an award ceremony.,The diversity of the performances paralleled the extensive spectrum of styles and personalities that made up those of the people in attendance.,The Brooklyn Nightlife Awards were also one of the most inclusive LGBTQA events I’ve attended since I’ve lived in Brooklyn.

It was refreshing and exciting to see so many people from all over the LGBTQ spectrum both performing and sharing in the uniqueness and talent that makes up the Brooklyn nightlife scene, creating a new version of homonormative artistic space to which only Brooklyn can lay claim.,Sponsors for the event included One Last Shag in Bedstuy, Sugarland, Nightclub in Williamsburg, and Bagelsmith.

It was a chilly Thursday evening but folks made their way to industrial Meadow Street for an evening of melodic variety and good company. A really nice crowd of longtime friends of Aputumpu and of the bands came to support them. The Micks started off the show with foot-tapping, blues inspired, punk rock and garage undertones.,Osekre & The Lucky Bastards (who , quite a few times) played next. Fronted by the founder of Aputumpu, Osekre delivered so much energy when he performed, it fueled the audience into a dancing frenzy. This six-member band, composed of brass, strings and drums, pulls its sound from African folk, punk, indie, and other genres. What makes this band so enjoyable is their capability to mix multiple types of music and form an upbeat sound that everyone can relate to.,Following Osekre was ,, a four-piece dreamy shoegaze band who have been getting a lot of press lately. At this point in the show, if anyone was seated, they were now standing up by the stage.

In the Hood," , ,As I like to say, “If you’re confused, they’re confused,” which certainly seems to fit here. This gentleman is likely giving you some signals but not a green light. I applaud your attitude of not getting more involved under the circumstances. I’m guessing it’s awkward to ask this guy more direct questions about his girl, but have you tried asking him to bring her along sometime? It sounds like neither of you want to make her that real.,At the end of the day, what counts is the fact that this guy is not available, and he’s not being as responsible for his status as he could be. Even if this chick doesn’t exist, he’s still using her as a , between you two. I do think you realize all that, you are just enjoying the time you spend with him and understandably don’t want to fuck with that. If he’s holding back for whatever reason, whatever that reason is likely to make him a bad relationship bet for anyone. I don’t think he’s fully in a relationship with his supposed girlfriend either and likely wouldn’t be able to be with anyone in the way I think you are looking for. I think it’s important that you see this flaw in him, which will help you to keep from taking his actions, or lack thereof, personally.,When you wrote  “…a man I think I could have a real future with” this indicates that you are fantasizing about the future. Fantasy is almost always better than reality. Hanging out in a fantasy world is pretty much a guaranteed setup for disappointment—you need to leave the movie theater in your head.,Though I’m curious as to why you are asking me this question, it’s worth discussing. I think by far, the main motivation for people to hold onto their virginity is because of religious influences which says sex before marriage is wrong and abstinence is the way to go. However, you seem to be pondering the question of whether you should have sex before you are specifically 21, as if you are going to get some sort of certificate proclaiming you are of age to have sex. ,I think what’s more important is to be able to make a decision that is right for you. In the days before birth control, it made good sense to wait. I get the feeling from the way you asked your question, that you may be out of touch as to whether you are ready to have sex or not. You are the only person that can truly answer that. There may be people who are judging you one way or another, or a whole host of outside influences that are confusing you. This is an opportune time to figure out how YOU really feel and draw you own personal conclusions. If you make a choice that you think is right for you at the time, then that’s the correct decision.,From what I’ve read, ,Conversely, I’ve also read that,In my opinion, the person you lose your virginity to and the circumstances at the time will have impact on your feelings and thoughts about sex for the future. You don’t want to break your leg when you go skiing for the first time. I think the most important factor when you start to have sex with someone you trust and even hopefully respect, no matter what age you are.","Dr. Lisa, S.P., is a self-proclaimed psychotherapist, artist, performer and comedian.

Their new album has a remarkable drive, more aggressive lyrics and guitar, and feels more like the passing of years and ideas gone by., ,
Apparently they spent their time dwelling in dark thoughts while recording and writing the new album. (Vague) concerns of the apocolypse, and the (skeptical but global nevertheless) fear that surrounded the end of 2012 trickled into their songwriting.

For this lovely purpose, let me recommend the 56 Bogart building located right across the street from Morgan L train stop. The building is home to numerous artist studios, but mainly to 10 galleries on the ground floor and at the basement level. The high concentration of art at 56 Bogart makes the building a go-to destination when you acutely need large quantities of great art. Here is what to see right now:,If you planned on skipping the basement of 56 Bogart building, I have to stop you right there. The cozy galley Theodore:Art makes the basement well worth visiting. In the current show, Theodore:Art is featuring the works of Tad Beck  and Diana Cherbuliez. Both artists have been living and working in Vinalhaven, Maine for over 20 years and have shared a practice and friendship.,Beck works in photography, video and installations; Cherbuliez in sculpture and video. The exhibition emanates an acute feeling of nostalgia, maybe the solitude of an isolated island community. Solitude for a city dweller may sound synonymous to sadness, but at Theodore:Art solitude means the comfort of being with one’s self.,The exhibition reads like a good novel that uncovers layers of emotions and sensations; the works of both artists communicate and subtly complement each other.,I was particularly struck by the lenticular prints of Tad Beck. This interesting printing technique is known mainly through its use in kid’s school supplies and advertising, but has found an interesting use in silent, thoughtful photography work., ,Robert and Henry curated an exhibition of NYC-based artist Elise Engler that makes every order-seeking mind very happy. Elise Engler has been creating colored pencil drawings of miniature objects related to her travels – everything from her passport and suitcases to souvenirs she has brought from Galapagos. Her drawings are extensive, very orderly representations of items related to selected situations (,; ,). Her pencil sprites reveal personal experience and unleash a whimsical story within.,Were you a fan of unconventional gallery The Bogart Salon under the reign of its former director Peter Hopkins? Well, don’t be sad anymore, because Peter Hopkins reinvented the concept of a gallery by mixing traditional exhibitions and discussion forum, and opened his new gallery Art Helix in the same building (just the hallway from The Bogart Salon). They have some good art on display at Art Helix right now.

Together with his partners, he created and restored the frames of the most valuable masterpieces of the history. Yes, including Mona Lisa’s frame in Louvre.,“It’s not that I don’t like art that people sometimes bring in,” Marcello says with a charismatic smile in his little office. “It’s just not what we do here…” Marcello Quebracho was born and raised in Argentina to an Italian family with a long tradition of framing. “Four generations of framers,” Marcello tells me. His classical education in restoration of wood and his PhD in ornaments obtained in Florence, Italy, likely makes Quebracho the only framing company of its kind.,“I personally do the research on how the frame should look, what materials were used in that particular period, identify the reasoning and the religious customs,” Marcello explains his role at Quebracho. “We make each frame from scratch here. That makes us very different from other companies in the country,” Marcello continues explaining the process. “Each frame begins as a piece of wood here.”,Even though, they are framing extremely valuable art in Bushwick, they don’t store the art in the building. The institution holds and maintains the pieces.,Quebracho relocated to Bushwick from Glendale. “We were looking for an opportunity to buy a building instead of renting. Also we wanted to be in a more artistic place,” said Marcello who, as you can imagine, deeply admires art. “We were looking at Williamsburg but that was impossible,” he continued.,It took Quebracho almost a year to finish repairs on their building located only steps away from Bushwick Five Points, but in our opinion it was well worth it. Entering the building feels like entering a different world. The building is peaceful, beautiful and spacious; rays of light touche the layers of real gold on frames stacked on shelves, while Quebracho employees perform complicated tasks that require enormous levels of craftsmanship.,All of the Quebracho employees are brought in from Latin America. “You cannot find a worker in the United States who reaches the same level of craftsmanship,” said Marcello. “All of them are legal,” Marcello explained that it is very easy to obtain working papers for foreign workers if similar workers cannot be found in the United States.,Having a gem of business like Quebracho in Bushwick is almost unbelievable.

That a shopping district was changed to adapt to the needs of a , population can hardly be called a bad thing, but , effectively,lays out for the viewer the general outright dismissal of what was already there, by both government and consumers alike. The film effectively pairs such scenes as the newer shoppers at the nearby farmer’s market at Prospect Park making fun of what’s sold on Fulton Street, with the Korean hair salon owner who depends on her business there to support her family.,The notion of “retail diversity,” or offering consumers in a growing neighborhood more than what’s readily available, is one that’s becoming more relevant in Bushwick with every new bar, restaurant and yoga studio that has come to accommodate the influx of professionals who’ve arrived in the past few years. Nearby neighborhoods like Fort Greene are getting a glimpse at the future of gentrification; the reward for many of the small businesses who helped give the neighborhood its cultural cachet is often their ,.,For close to a decade, my uncle once owned one of those businesses on DeKalb Avenue in Fort Greene. A self-taught ,, he put his own sweat equity into the space, sold his signature hats to celebrities like Samuel L. Jackson and Mos Def, and put his business and the larger neighborhood on the map. When restaurants like The General Greene and Bagel World moved onto the block, his landlord reckoned he could make more money raising the rent, so he did. Today, the former site of Malchijah Hats is currently a pet supply store.,Like several of the businesses featured in , who ended up being evicted because of re-zoning, things didn’t end up so bad for my uncle in the end. He found a space further down the road on Atlantic Avenue that was bigger and cheaper than the one he had before, and luckily, his patrons ended up following him there. Still, to hear those uninformed shoppers featured in the farmer’s market scene in , blithely refer to the shops on Fulton Street as “turds” that they wished would just “go away” filled me with an anger and sadness I hadn’t counted on when sitting down to watch the film.,As a Brooklynite who has seen neighborhoods like Park Slope, Crown Heights and Fort Greene completely change, Anderson openly acknowledges the role she plays in helping to sanitize the neighborhoods she was attracted to for their diversity. She cops to being conflicted by the feelings of looking forward to having a trendy new place to shop at when she knows that shop’s success could mean her current neighbors might have to find a new place to live. It’s the type of honest admission that I could identify with as a college-educated black male from upstate New York who never dreamed of living anywhere else but Brooklyn.

									Top 5 Events This Weekend for a Bushwick Polar Bear							",Katarina Hybenova,,
Mind and Body,"Everything. When we exercise, we choose what we would like to feel like, and we choose the experience we’d like to have with our body. Take swimming, for example. It gives you a totally different feeling and experience than that from a kickboxing class does. Both are great choices; both give you very different results.,This case study is of a client at Bushwick Pilates combining her exercise and movement with a Custom Designed Ritual. She started by placing an intention into her exercise. Her intention was to get her “yang,” or masculine energy, laser-focused and in service of her “yin,” or feminine energy.,In her design session, we customized her exercise to go with her intention for her life. It’s just like creating a recipe to bake a certain dessert, talking about your goals with a new trainer. We created an activity that would give her nervous system and body the feeling and experience she wanted to have in the rest of her life.,The client approached a swimming pool with a knife between her teeth and dove into the water. As she swam through the pool, she cut a treasure chest loose from the bottom of the pool and swam a small obstacle course.,She then exited the pool with the treasure chest, sliced it open, and served herself fresh figs that had been placed inside with her blade. The title of her Custom Designed Ritual was “Marry Yourself.” It was about combining her exercise with her desire to always take care of and be in a good relationship with herself. Within 3 months, this same client got married, tripled her income by rebranding her business and became pregnant, something she had wanted!,One of my favorite teachers has a saying that goes, “How you do anything is how you do everything.” This is the cornerstone belief of combining your exercise with a Custom Designed Ritual, and this is what we do here at Bushwick Pilates. The world is crying for us to bring our whole bodied self to the table in how we love and how we live. Combining a Custom Designed Ritual with how you condition your body results in feeling more of your power and more of your truth all day every day.","Emily Tepper is Ritual Designer & Owner, Bushwick Pilates.","Bushwick Pilates,Emily Tepper,exercise,the ritualist","

"Featured,In the Hood","The neighborhood of Bushwick was shocked by the multiple attacks on women that occurred in ,. “He grabs the women in the dark from behind and slams them against a building wall, covering their mouths so they can’t scream. He has attacked several women on Knickerbocker Ave., on White St, Bushwick Ave, & Moore St (near Roberta’s),” read an email we received, which quickly became viral on Facebook and in the windows of Bushwick establishments. The sad narrative instigated an assumption that we have a serial rapist in Bushwick who needs to be put behind the bars asap. Our readers have constantly asked what is going on.,We have called the 83rd Precinct of NYPD multiple times. Earlier in January, an officer refused to confirm one individual suspect, and told us that Bushwick is one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the City, and everybody should always be careful. He recommended never walking alone, especially late at night, women and men alike. A very basic ,, in addition to the numerous comments under our ,, shows that thinking that Bushwick has only one serial rapist would be optimistic. Dangerous streets are the reality in Bushwick.,NYPD further referred us to the , they publish weekly on their website. Currently available stats for the week of January 7 – January 13, 2012  in the 83rd Precinct list: 2 rapes, 1 misdemeanor sex assault and 8 misdemeanor assaults. However, following the ,, many believe that NYPD stats are underreported; additionally we have to take into account that many of the assaults don’t get reported at all. “I met with top officers of the 83rd, 90th & 94th precincts. They can’t serve you if no one is reporting these incidents that have been going on in Bushwick and Williamsburg area. They can’t deploy their resources if they don’t know what’s happening. I have repeatedly encouraged people to report their incidents to the police. People, trust me there is a big police presence in these areas; 83rd precinct has 30 officers on foot from Starr St. and up Wyckoff Ave and across to Knickerbocker Ave,” writes Jay Ruiz, the founder and the president of Brooklyn Bike Patrol on their , encouraging victims to report the attacks.,Brooklyn Bike Patrol is a volunteer organization “highly committed to the safety of women in Brooklyn,” as Jay told us on the phone. You can call them at 718-744-7592 in the late evening hours and a biker will escort you home.,On January 18, 2013, , on the attacks on women in Bushwick. Unfortunately, the Post chose to interview only white looking women (not actual victims, only women who “heard” about the attacks), sparking a reaction on the Internet that these attacks are some sort of a racially motivated response to the recent gentrification of the neighborhood. However, comparing , over the years shows that safety has been a consistent problem in the area. According to statistics published by the NYPD’s 83rd Precinct, there were 39 reported rapes in 2012. In 1990, there were more than twice as many - the precinct reported 80 rapes. Unfortunately, this situation is a problem for all the women in the area because they are especially vulnerable targets.,What can we do to be safer in Bushwick today? Follow the recommendations of NYPD and Brooklyn Bike Patrol. Don’t walk alone after dark and use common sense when it comes to especially dangerous areas such as the borders of the precincts (e.g. Broadway, according to the officer from the 83 Precinct that we talked to). If you’re out late at night, call for the assistance of Brooklyn Bike Patrol at (718) 744-7592, or simply take a cab  (Bushwick Car Service at (718) 497-7148 or Fenix Car Service at (718) 821-2121).

In the Hood,"I was really pleased to read James Ryder’s recent article, , James writes: ,As a relatively recent hetero transplant from Chelsea, I was surprised to read this since Chelsea seemed much more sexually segregated. I really enjoy how much the LGBTQ community feels integrated in a particularly healthy way in Bushwick. But James’ article highlighted that there simply aren’t enough places to go for queers to socialize just with each other.,I hadn’t thought about this until now and I felt James was doing us a service by bringing the topic to the table. Of course, just as any article involving sexual politics, the comments had the usual back and forth sniping. FishBait BK wrote, , And a comment from MushRoom indicated he was happy with the way things are, ,The comments showed that some queer people think all is good in Bushwick, while others hint at a seemingly repressed anger in the queer community towards breeders. I wanted to get the issues out in the open, ,, which I hope will help illuminate the Bushwick LGBTQ point of view for the rest of us., , I would definitely have to agree that New York City, in general, is a place where one can be themselves entirely and find many others that will share their life experience without judgment in regards to sexual orientation, gender expression, race, nationality, religion, or other identity traits. I think many people who come here or live here are still a bit hetero-biased, meaning they live their lives with and around straight people and while they vocally support gay rights, but they aren’t going to make any extra effort to befriend LGBTQ people in the area. Many of my friends and I discuss the simple DIFFERENCE LGBTQ people feel when they speak to those in their own community versus speaking to heterosexuals. Many cis heterosexuals are incredibly well-intentioned, but are oblivious to their own internally embedded beliefs that sometimes surface in the form of hetero-bias without quite realizing it.  One man, someone I’ve known for a while and who I’m comfortable with, had no idea that saying, “Well, I think gay people are totally fine. I have no problem with them, but I do think they’re unnecessary… I mean, they don’t reproduce.” But I think a constructive and realistic perspective on the hetero-bias of the people living in and moving into Bushwick is beneficial to the growth of the region MUCH MORE than living in an idealistic delusion in which LGBTQ people, especially the T and Q on that spectrum, face bias and estrangement., From my article from last week, someone wrote a great comment on how social media and applications specifically designed for gay men to date one another has completely changed the social landscape for queers in areas like Bushwick. It changes the demand for specifically designated gay bars, because one only needs to turn on his phone in order to chat with other openly gay men in his neighborhood. I think, also, events and parties that are queer in Bushwick are more focused on artistic expression and integrity, because with applications and dating sites hooking up has become a side note to nightlife rather than the main attraction. I still need to spend more time analyzing how these applications and sites affect the gay community in Bushwick versus the straight community, but I would definitely say that they have made a major impact.,  ,Gender, gender, gender. It is constantly and continually frustrating how often heterosexual people (and, in fact, many gay people) correlate gender and sex. The gender of which you identify, your gender expression, and your biological sex are not innately interlinked. I feel that throughout my life I, and many of the LGBTQ people I’ve known, have experienced less direct homophobia (that is, hatred or fear based simply on orientation) and much more discrimination based on our gender expression. Constantly, the humanity and value of effeminate gay men is undermined and outright denied. In the most recent election, gay political prodigy Nate Wizard was called “too effeminate” to be able to accurately predict the results. This correlation between trivial “feminine” traits - a high voice, a particular way of walking, etc. – and stupidity is, in my eyes, outright sexism., , Well, each individual wants something completely different. Writers and editors of the Advocate are most likely proponents of (at least legal) integration, while activists such as the queer group Bash Back! are steadfastly anti-assimilationist. It’s undeniable that most people want to be respected in their community. While I think it would be pretty difficult NOT to assimilate to some extent, some of the writings of activists such as those in the Bash Back! collective and the academic writings of queer theorists are incredibly interesting and discuss the option of deconstructing what it means to be part of a heteronormative society, what limits that society places upon the individual, and whether or not queers should be trying to imitate and integrate into such an oppressive society. I think a lot of queers now are discussing how the fundamental social norms (those very same things we talked about above that straights take for granted) are actually constructs built upon the exclusion and oppression of queers. Some of us want to change those social constructs altogether, starting with the polarity of sexuality and gender.,As for the second part of the question, all I can say is that if a heterosexual person in Bushwick is already open-minded enough to think to themselves, “How can I be more accepting of queer people?” then I would hope they would take that extra step to really think about how they think and feel about what it means to be gay and perhaps even read some feminist and queer literature. The expansion of their perspective on the matter just by reading contemporary social theory will inevitably change the way they interact with everyone around them, including LGBTQ people.,Mainly this all sounds a bit self-conscious to me. I wonder if part of the reason you’re having trouble identifying who you’re attracted to is because you are thinking about it too much and it’s getting in the way of your using your instincts. It seems as if you’re evaluating the potential men as either “the same” or “different” from you. Maybe try not to try so hard to think about why you are/are not interested in them. Simply see if you have fun with someone enough to want to spend more time with them, regardless of the details. Being attracted to straight men, in your case, likely means that you are attracted to unavailable people, which generally would say that you may have a fear of getting close to someone who is a real possibility for you.","Dr. Lisa, S.P., is a self-proclaimed psychotherapist, artist, performer and comedian.

Music,"In the last moments of poise before the internet music machine squats down and shits out 2013, I’d like to take a look back at three great artists who came up this past year. I’d venture to say they all produced under-appreciated records, but to be honest I’m nauseated by music journalism so probably I’m unqualified to make statements like that or to write about music at all, but hey, I’m just here playing my trumpet.

 ,Anyone who’s come to my house for slow jams & wine knows that music gets extra points if it could be mistaken for a Vanessa Williams B-side. But what makes “My Refuge” incredible is not it’s homage to sweet histories, but it’s sharp turn into transcendence. That pause after the opening keyboard passage is really long, and very necessary, because the following plunge is literally into the future.,Also, future is the real conversation here. Napolian was only 19 or 20 when this was recorded. The record shows sonic ability, drum smarts, instrumentalism, and real songwriting talent.

 ,Like most of Anduin’s ,, “Dyadic 27″ is incredibly stylish and immediately terrifying. Over a backdropped synth canvas, Richomond VA’s Jonathan Lee layers the snick and scratch of worn 20th century apparatuses. The song’s gentle narrative curve leads the listener on a singular search. Somewhere along the way, a saxophone turns up and lets out a few lonely secrets, and that’s the moment when I really fall for this record.

Bundle up and visit a friend you haven’t seen in a while or bike to a part of Brooklyn or Queens you’ve never been to. Do your research about roads with bike lanes to make your trip less stressful. I recently rode over the Williamsburg Bridge and then did some gallery crawling through the Lower East Side. Make sure to keep warm with these essentials:,1. Gloves! Lined ones would be best; strictly cotton let way too much wind through.,2. Warm hat or headband (and helmet! You’ve seen the reports of recent bike accidents…),3. Scarf! A warm one, but not one that’s so big you won’t be able to look to the side.,4. Thick socks and boots.,5. Layers! Leggings under pants, a breathable shirt, a warm sweater, plus a decent wind-breaking, but movable, coat., ,Another all year long favorite workout for the brave ones is to walk or run from Bushwick to Manhattan three times a week over the Williamsburg Bridge. , The bridge crossing is particularly enjoyable in the winter because, besides doing this, my lazy butt would likely be indoors all winter. Plus, you can remind yourself of how great fresh air is and how manageable the cold is when you are moving! Besides feeling great physically and mentally, I have actually lost weight this way, according to the comments I get (I am afraid of the scale), and I have dropped one jeans size - all without any extra dieting, which was not true of the body conditioning workouts I did at the gym before I moved to Brooklyn. Most importantly, this workout has a meditative quality, which has really helped me think clearly and feel relaxed for the rest of the day. , ",,"biking,bikram yoga,bikram yoga williamsburg,boxing,Green Fitness Studio,running,walking,warm workout","
