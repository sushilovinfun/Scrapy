" ,Summer doesn’t end just because the calendar says it’s Labor Day on Monday. But one has to admit that it certainly feels a little different. Whether you like it or not it’s time to wake up from the summer romantic dreaming and GO! …or drift…,While the past weeks floated by sweetly in the form of watermelons and on tops of the roof, the upcoming week is filling me with great expectations and just a (lil), pointy anxiety as is always the case when the number of art openings in the hood exceeds 10. Not only is virtually every gallery in Bushwick having an opening, it’s also a time for two bigger events to happen. , and , will both happen next weekend.,Go! Brooklyn is an all Brooklyn open studio event organized by Brooklyn Museum. “Open your studio and wait for the votes from your visitors,” says Brooklyn Museum. “If enough votes are casted, and if you’re lucky, you might get a show at Brooklyn Museum.” In other words, Brooklyn Museum says that you better send out at least 5 emails to your contact list; create that Facebook event and buy 6 bottles of Trader Joe’s wine, to ensure that people come and vote, because a lot is at stake. I have to appreciate the lesson in self-promotion Brooklyn Museum is trying to teach us here. Yes, it is important to let people know you exist because if they don’t know you exist, does it even matter that you create? Interesting c, had this week Jen Hitchings with a married artist couple Jane Fine and James Esber, who have been collaborating for years and even share a studio, yet Jane decided to Go! and James decided not to Go!,On Monday, , from , and the brain behind another big event next week, , write about the concept and his inspiration. In his essay he pronounced a couple of amazing quotes on creativity and innovation that I wish we all pondered a little longer than usual.,I consider myself a Buddhist, and I like citydrift better. Much smaller budget, much smaller PR, much more concept to it. citydrift invites us to come to one of the participating galleries and join one of the drifts that will go on a walk around Bushwick. Each drift will consist of a small group of people, like 7 or 10, and will have more or less concept to it. What all the drifts will have in common is that you will be encouraged to experience, to perceive, to see, to feel, to drift… Whether it’s an intentionally placed art installation or an accidentally discovered beauty, citydrift is essentially a trip back to the beginning where we ask: Why art? Why feel? And most importantly, it places the emphasis on the experience of art that should bring joy, pleasure and happiness.  Because no matter what they tell you, a show at Brooklyn Museum will not bring you happiness. It will bring you societal recognition, but not happiness. Because happiness is your state of mind when you feel and create out of the pure desire of heart and the only approval that matters is your own., ,Anyway, I wish you an amazing “last” summer weekend. Enjoy and next week, back to work!, ",http://bushwickdaily.com/2012/08/friday-editorial-will-you-go-or-will-you-drift/,Friday Editorial: Will you ‘Go!’ or will you ‘drift’?

Brooklyn is an all Brooklyn open studio event organized by Brooklyn Museum. “Open your studio and wait for the votes from your visitors,” says Brooklyn Museum. “If enough votes are casted, and if you’re lucky, you might get a show at Brooklyn Museum.” In other words, Brooklyn Museum says that you better send out at least 5 emails to your contact list; create that Facebook event and buy 6 bottles of Trader Joe’s wine, to ensure that people come and vote, because a lot is at stake. I have to appreciate the lesson in self-promotion Brooklyn Museum is trying to teach us here. Yes, it is important to let people know you exist because if they don’t know you exist, does it even matter that you create? Interesting c, had this week Jen Hitchings with a married artist couple Jane Fine and James Esber, who have been collaborating for years and even share a studio, yet Jane decided to Go! and James decided not to Go!,On Monday, , from , and the brain behind another big event next week, , write about the concept and his inspiration. In his essay he pronounced a couple of amazing quotes on creativity and innovation that I wish we all pondered a little longer than usual.,I consider myself a Buddhist, and I like citydrift better. Much smaller budget, much smaller PR, much more concept to it. citydrift invites us to come to one of the participating galleries and join one of the drifts that will go on a walk around Bushwick. Each drift will consist of a small group of people, like 7 or 10, and will have more or less concept to it. What all the drifts will have in common is that you will be encouraged to experience, to perceive, to see, to feel, to drift… Whether it’s an intentionally placed art installation or an accidentally discovered beauty, citydrift is essentially a trip back to the beginning where we ask: Why art? Why feel? And most importantly, it places the emphasis on the experience of art that should bring joy, pleasure and happiness.  Because no matter what they tell you, a show at Brooklyn Museum will not bring you happiness. It will bring you societal recognition, but not happiness. Because happiness is your state of mind when you feel and create out of the pure desire of heart and the only approval that matters is your own., ,Anyway, I wish you an amazing “last” summer weekend. Enjoy and next week, back to work!, ",http://bushwickdaily.com/2012/08/friday-editorial-will-you-go-or-will-you-drift/,Friday Editorial: Will you ‘Go!’ or will you ‘drift’?

"At 7:45 am I loaded up my cart with 200 copies of the first issue of the Brooklyn Occupant, 20 umbrellas, a dozen foam core signs with prints from ,, and headed out to , May Day Morning Commute. As I looked at the pile of supplies I gathered, I had a twinge of doubt as to whether there would be enough people at Maria Hernandez to distribute them to. The facebook event had climbed from 162 to 188 confirmed attendees during the night, but being a musician who uses facebook to invite people to gigs, I’d become understandably cynical as to the accuracy of RSVP counts in the digital world.,As I walked up the southwest pathway of the park towards the center circle, I could only see about a dozen people standing around in umbrellas and panchos and my heart started to sink a little bit. I knew that the numbers would climb a bit before we commenced our march, but the image in my head of only 15 people chanting and holding banners wasn’t going to be very inspiring or impressive. I shook off these pessimistic thoughts as I walked up to the circle and gave a big hollar and shouted “Happy May Day!” I figured if we’re going to be small, might as well be spirited.,Naturally, there was a disproportionate police presence standing around, but that’s pretty much the status quo for all occupy events. Moments after I started pulling out supplies from my cart, a community relations officer walked up beside me and asked “Who’s in charge here?”, which prompts me to laugh a little bit before I say “Everyone, but I can talk to you about the event if you have any questions.” The officer was very polite with me and after I told her what our route for the march was, she said “I know why you’re marching and I just wanna make sure you guys are safe,” and gave me a look that undeniably signaled her suppressed support for the cause.,As 9am approached and people continued to stream in at a steady pace. Even more encouraging was the amount of press that had showed up to cover the event. There was one reporter from ,, another covering the story for WNYC, and more that I didn’t even notice until well into the march. By the time we were ready to embark, over fifty people had amassed and all of my fears of a “mini-march” dissolved completely.,We marched from Knickerbocker to Flushing to Broadway, escorted by at least a dozen police vehicles on the street and bookended by officers. The goal of this event wasn’t to “block the streets” or “shutdown Bushwick”, but if it had been, we couldn’t have had a better ally than the NYPD. Their escort caravan pretty much stopped the traffic on Broadway from Flushing all the way to the Williamsburg Bridge. At first, this sort of disruption made some marchers (myself included) nervous about turning off morning commuters stuck in the traffic, but that fear turned out to be unfounded as car after car honked and threw out calls and waves of support. One of the organizers of the march, Kyle, didn’t miss a single opportunity to run up to each friendly driver and give them some literature on May Day.,As I walked, a reporter with CapitalNewYork.com , about the march and OWS in general. I told him that for me, OWS has become a civic obligation. Either I try to make this movement work, or sit back and watch the status quo destroy itself. The Democratic party’s behavior since the 2012 election has forced me to acknowledge the fact that the bi-partisan consensus has left me behind. If I want to see end the wars on drugs and terror, a stop to corporate hegemony over political discourse, or a full and open accounting of the crimes of Wall St and high-level government officials, there simply is no place for me in the two party system.,Once we arrived at Continental Plaza at 10am, members of Occupy Williamsburg were waiting to join us. A big cheer went around the park as we arrived everyone gathered around the statue of George Washington. Almost immediately, a member of the National Lawyers Guild mic-checked the crowd to inform all of us of our rights, how to deal with being arrested, and asked everyone to write their phone number on their arm.,The march over the bridge was pushed back a half hour to 11am, to allow for more people to join us. As we waited, everyone got to know everyone, more reporters from the local ABC and NBC affiliates conducted interviews, and a large group decided to march around the plaza until it was time to leave in the hope of bringing along some of the nearby locals. When it was finally time to head out, we had gathered somewhere between 200 and 300 people. The police announced to the crowd that we were to keep moving, not to go onto roadway (which isn’t even really possible to do on the bridge), and not to drop any banners. With that we set out onto the bridge, along with the mini-marching band of drums and even a tuba that had at some point joined up with us, and aside from three arrests of occupiers who masked up and were carrying shields, everything went perfectly smoothly.,All of us in the movement have different priorities and embrace different tactics, but we are united in our understanding of the fact that our government has rendered the average citizen’s opinion to be irrelevant. The 1% (or more accurately the 0.1%) have attained full-spectrum dominance of our political discourse through their control of major traditional media outlets and campaign contributions. We are working to subvert that dominance by reminding people of the power we have when we come together to say “ENOUGH”.,Some still lament the fact that OWS doesn’t have a one or two “demands”, but this is an extremely uninformed criticism. Every single person in this movement has a set of demands, which they’d all be more than happy to share with you (whether you ask them to or not), and it’s not hard at all to find several that nearly all of us share:,That’s just a handful of policy proposals that I suspect every single Occupier would love to see enacted, or at least wouldn’t be opposed to. Not one of those issues is a part of the Democratic or Republican party platforms, nor will they ever be without heavy and sustained pressure from the people.

"Since the beginning of the Occupation, there has been a war of perception for Occupiers to fight on two fronts. From some on the right, we are fighting against the simplistic assumption that the Occupation is just a bunch of whining beggars looking for handouts.

From my vantage point working within the movement, I believe the Occupation has proven its worth in many ways overlooked by those who haven’t been witnessing it first hand.,Here are four reasons why I’m proud to continue supporting OWS:,I was never a full-time Occupier.

I knew that if anyone made me feel threatened, I could always just yell “Mic check! Asshole!”, point to the offending asshole, and consider myself covered. That never happened, but the point is that any reports that Zuccotti was full of dangerous, volatile people did not square with what I saw first hand. As such, the disproportionately large police presence constantly surrounding the park seemed almost comical if one didn’t pause to consider the intent and effect of this enforcement policy: to intimidate others from participating.,The first time I , felt unsafe in Liberty Plaza was the ,, with the police in full riot gear and pepper spraying the crowd, seemingly at random.

"It took , no time at all to display what makes him tick when I met up with him in a café in Williamsburg. Before I could even see him take a marker out of his pocket, he had already begun sketching caricatures of the people in the café in each segment of the spread out napkin.  They were wearing big headphones, most were on laptops or plugged into something, and their simple eyes made from large circles looked up at us from the page…er….cloth.,“I’m intrigued, I’m intrigued by the people that are here,” he said, a simple answer that explains a lot in his work.,The UK expat creates murals, apparel, drawings, music, paintings and much more, mostly consisting of flat cartoon or comic like characters. Sometimes they’re bright and colorful, other times they are completely born of a pen, existing only in thick black lines. Some of them seem to resemble people, animals, fruits or other figures found in nature, but are entirely of their own world.,“If you draw a little thing with a face, it’s not a character in my mind. A character is when it starts to have a personality, it has a back story, you know, it has dreams and desires and goals and something it aims for,” Burgerman said.,He went on to describe that although it isn’t very possible to pinpoint exactly where these characters and their environments come from, perhaps there can be some attribution to childhood favorites like Tex Avery and Warner Brother’s Cartoons, as well as a British comic book involving the character “Beano,” who he described as the British Dennis the Menace.,Burgerman liked these characters and stories specifically for the fact that they were unlike super hero comics. There are not many adult themes of cities, cars, muscles, danger, revenge and desire or dramatic images of flowing capes, bulging biceps and leotards in these comics and cartoons. But what they did provide was an existence of their own world with their own rules.,“They’re completely bizarre but they make sense within in their own terms,” he said, sighting the instances of a character running off a cliff, standing in midair for a moment, and then falling. “That’s completely accepted. I like to think or hope that across the work that I make, it’s not as literal as hat but there is a kind of Burgerman world or a world of my work where it can all sit together.”,Drawing and painting isn’t all the artist is up to these days. He was also excited to speak of his band, ,. The band came from an idea his friend and fellow character artist Jim Avignon had, about creating a sort of art band. Burgerman learned to play the ukulele for the band, and Anxieteam seemed to become both a nice change of pace yet point of inspiration from painting and drawing. He explained that if you’re lucky enough to make a living doing what you love, unfortunately what you love becomes work. So what do you do in your free time? Enter, Anxieteam.,The band has a great influence in his artwork and vice versa.,“What I try and do is treat the making of songs the same way I would treat the making of art or drawings so the topics and ideas for songs and titles of songs could easily be a tie off for paintings and exhibitions, and I don’t see them as separate things. I see them as — I’m a person and I make stuff, and that stuff could be apparel, it could be digital, it could be made out of acrylic paint, it could be made out of pencil it could be a song or a rhyme, it could be just text, but they’re all in the same world which I created around myself so, why not music?”,You can check out Anxieteam this Wednesday the 16th at , in Greenpoint.,I first met Burgerman standing in the middle of his latest work, “The Garden of Eden, Bushwick” at , in Bushwick. On three walls of the gallery’s courtyard, we see images that have human features but are certainly not recognizable as our own, all colorful and overlapping within this lush looking atmosphere juxtaposed against Bushwick’s gritty industrial surfaces. We see animals, insects, fruits and a large scale Adam, absent of his Eve. This mural shows a different style from Burgerman, not as neat or finely drawn as we are used to seeing from him.  The painting style is a bit more rough and strokey, and he revealed that he only used brushes for this piece, no spray cans or pens.

"It took , no time at all to display what makes him tick when I met up with him in a café in Williamsburg. Before I could even see him take a marker out of his pocket, he had already begun sketching caricatures of the people in the café in each segment of the spread out napkin.  They were wearing big headphones, most were on laptops or plugged into something, and their simple eyes made from large circles looked up at us from the page…er….cloth.,“I’m intrigued, I’m intrigued by the people that are here,” he said, a simple answer that explains a lot in his work.,The UK expat creates murals, apparel, drawings, music, paintings and much more, mostly consisting of flat cartoon or comic like characters. Sometimes they’re bright and colorful, other times they are completely born of a pen, existing only in thick black lines. Some of them seem to resemble people, animals, fruits or other figures found in nature, but are entirely of their own world.,“If you draw a little thing with a face, it’s not a character in my mind. A character is when it starts to have a personality, it has a back story, you know, it has dreams and desires and goals and something it aims for,” Burgerman said.,He went on to describe that although it isn’t very possible to pinpoint exactly where these characters and their environments come from, perhaps there can be some attribution to childhood favorites like Tex Avery and Warner Brother’s Cartoons, as well as a British comic book involving the character “Beano,” who he described as the British Dennis the Menace.,Burgerman liked these characters and stories specifically for the fact that they were unlike super hero comics. There are not many adult themes of cities, cars, muscles, danger, revenge and desire or dramatic images of flowing capes, bulging biceps and leotards in these comics and cartoons. But what they did provide was an existence of their own world with their own rules.,“They’re completely bizarre but they make sense within in their own terms,” he said, sighting the instances of a character running off a cliff, standing in midair for a moment, and then falling. “That’s completely accepted. I like to think or hope that across the work that I make, it’s not as literal as hat but there is a kind of Burgerman world or a world of my work where it can all sit together.”,Drawing and painting isn’t all the artist is up to these days. He was also excited to speak of his band, ,. The band came from an idea his friend and fellow character artist Jim Avignon had, about creating a sort of art band. Burgerman learned to play the ukulele for the band, and Anxieteam seemed to become both a nice change of pace yet point of inspiration from painting and drawing. He explained that if you’re lucky enough to make a living doing what you love, unfortunately what you love becomes work. So what do you do in your free time? Enter, Anxieteam.,The band has a great influence in his artwork and vice versa.,“What I try and do is treat the making of songs the same way I would treat the making of art or drawings so the topics and ideas for songs and titles of songs could easily be a tie off for paintings and exhibitions, and I don’t see them as separate things. I see them as — I’m a person and I make stuff, and that stuff could be apparel, it could be digital, it could be made out of acrylic paint, it could be made out of pencil it could be a song or a rhyme, it could be just text, but they’re all in the same world which I created around myself so, why not music?”,You can check out Anxieteam this Wednesday the 16th at , in Greenpoint.,I first met Burgerman standing in the middle of his latest work, “The Garden of Eden, Bushwick” at , in Bushwick. On three walls of the gallery’s courtyard, we see images that have human features but are certainly not recognizable as our own, all colorful and overlapping within this lush looking atmosphere juxtaposed against Bushwick’s gritty industrial surfaces.

"I seldom relive the few days of my life when I was in ultimate fear, which for an equally short while kept me ultimately amused. It started in a bodega, late night, on the corner of myrtle and broadway, just before half the bodegs in the area had closed, and another half had opened. I was coming home from an event, probably that weekly party I was throwing at Happy Ending, with a friend who didn’t seem to be getting the hint. He lived close by and so I took the buddy system opportunity to have an escort for the not so dangerous subway ride, and less dangerous block walk home. Little did we know that along that path we would meet a man who was not only insane, but insanely resourceful, a most dangerous combination.,I thought he looked familiar, reminding me of some friends in the industrial scene from years past, back in Boston, MA. I knew that some of them had moved to the area, and so I felt certain that we had met before. Doubt clouded my intuition as my friend and I approached the front of the line, and thus him, who was waiting for a sandwich to be complied behind the deli counter. As we watch he pulls a can out of a paper bag, and slams it down on the counter with a grin and says “here, add this”. It looks like dog food, that stuff they put in Sloppy Joes at public schools and summer camps, ground beef in some sort of sauce. He looks at us and says, “they do not sell it here, so I had to buy it next door and bring it over”. The flood gates were open. He kept rambling on, speaking at us rather that to or with, his nonsense had some sort of hypnotic effect. It was the last time I took, “you live in that house?! I’ve been wondering for years what it’s like inside!” as initiative to let anyone in. I looked at my friend, with a look that said, without mistake, do NOT leave. We all went upstairs. The stranger with his huge dog [ which later I found out he borrowed from his little brother to look more human and approchable ], my friend and I. We sat around listening to stories as the stranger crushed up lines of adderall pills on my tiny glass coffee table. It soon became bright out, but uppers effect me too greatly to just sit tight, or just clean the entire house. The three of us, and the dog left for his place to watch one insightful movie or the other for another 8hrs, into the day. Unfortunately, my friend was not as affected by the adderall, and decided to walk home soon after our group exit. I sat awkwardly on the strangers couch, mind reeling, concentrating much to hard on the movie. He offered me downers, explaining they were opiates and would allow me to sleep. I look them. I spent the next 48hrs vomiting. About a month later I found out they were some sort of generic methadone, meant to keep his younger brother off heroine.,In the following month, I would get calls and text ranging from 2 to 10 times a day about how he was walking by my house, and whether I needed anything. He would show up at places I didn’t exactly invite him to, saying he was in the area anyway. Nothing was exact, but nothing was accurate. I couldn’t call him out on anything, not even when his mother, conveniently wandering the city, meeting up with him, who was also conveniently in the city, when I was done with a walk-through I might have mentioned the week before. She seemed as confused as I was, he blamed it on her delirium, saying, “mom, you remember where I work! You’ve been there before.” The architects directory did not list him, nor his mail. The background check did. My roommate and I marveled at the 10 or so misdemeanor accounts listed in Floria, I contacted the one friend he had ever mentioned by name. He was also from Floria, but was now in Fort Greene. I inquired professionally, asking for a creative reference, of the musical persuasion, since our stranger had claimed to be in quite a few non-local bands. Negatory. I read the response between the lines, “stay away.”,As my next few responses to text messages became stern in unavailability and nondescript in location, his became angry, confused and threatening. He demanded to know why I was not telling him where I was, if not home. I became scared, looking both ways before opening and closing the doors behind me. I would see him walking around the block at all hours of the day and night. The phone calls from his number, blocked numbers, and even fake ones did not stop for days. Soon, pleading emails came in. In his head, we had become romantically involved, he had planned on proposing to me. My friends and I were aghast. For a second I thought, “maybe he took our complete lack of physical and emotional involvement during the one month were in contact to mean I was old fashioned?” but a second later I realized that would be insane. I felt sad for him, in between the rushes of fear. He was calling everyone in the room, whose number he had acquired with one lie or another. He was calling from downstairs.,After my roommate chased him out of our building, the stranger went on, stalking bodegas for someone who was less inquisitive and much, much more impressionable. Thanks to the one friend who forgot to block him on facebook, we know that a few months later he got married [the legality is uncertain] to a girl more than 10 years his junior. Their child is now over 1yr old.,On a lighter note, check out my favorite recent creep lifestyle video with man after my own heart, John Waters ::",http://bushwickdaily.com/2011/03/bushwick-stalking/,Curious Wednesday: Bushwick Creepin’
