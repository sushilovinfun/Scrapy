"Featured,In the Hood"," ,by Cat Agonis,Some things yous can’t escape. That’s what I’ve learned about it all. I can’t escape bein a man. I get jealous and tight sometimes. Specially at work in front of the boys, if someone challenges me… And yous know how it is wit a dame. Some things yous can’t escape and that’s what I know.,I grew up in College Point. My family clan is from there. We’re Irish-Italian. I got pushed out to Maspeth to oversee a branch of pop’s plumbin business cause the Dooleys expand like that. Been in Maspeth since I was 19. Been in Maspeth for 15 years. It’s Queens–it’s where I’m from it’s who I am. New York baby.,Maspeth is a nice little place. It’s like yous in a village even though yous in Queens. For those of yous who don’t know Queens, alotta Queens is like that. In Maspeth they string the Christmas lights in December and have funeral homes for the departed. In Maspeth yous meet a cat young and he’ll be ya boy for life. Yous meet a girl young and she’ll be ya girl foreva.,My girl wasn’t my girl foreva though. Maybe that’s cause I actually met her in Forest Hills. Sometimes I take it there, to other parts of Queens. I took it too far in Forest Hills a coupla times and that’s how I ended up both wit my girl and then without her. She’s in Staten Island now wit my daughter and I’m sure to see my daughter every Sunday.,But otherwise I work and hang wit the guys. We talk about the girls we done, the ones we haven’t, the famous ones we never will – ya know, like Angelina Jolies. Just last Saturday I was at my boy Reggie’s. We was all playin beer pong and I can’t explain it. I got this feelin like I knew my life was gonna end…I heard things about the world endin in 2012 and the rapture from movies, like the action ones. I decided to make the most of it and smoke a blunt. Ya know. YOLO.,Now I don’t smoke that much. I’m really just a drinker, so this did my head in a little. I got the cabin fevers people sometimes get when they’re young and they can’t wait to get older, can’t wait to do things. Well I felt I wasn’t doin nuttin.,I thought I’d roll out to this bar we call the biggest little party place in Maspeth. Sometimes there’s hot young dames wearin tube tops, drinkin hard lemonades and whatnot, but this was a bad night. I hopped in my ride all drunk and high, lookin to get outta this town for once. I was too twisted to drive to Manhattan though. That was for sure. Instead I went down Flushing where I sometimes work. They got alotta buildins that need plumbin over there. Buildins for factories and stuffs. I never seen em at night and I doubted much happened ova there but for some reason I drove that way anyways. Outta habit I guess.,On the ride I thought about my life; maybe I could do more, maybe I could do less but ya know what – at least I was workin. All this thinkin made me paranoid and I seen some things that wasn’t there. Ya know, maybe I thought I saw the boys in blue or somethins.,I pulled over and wouldn’t ya know it – in the wall of some buildin was a door to a bar. Holy shit, I says to myself – I didn’t know they had bars round here.,I went inside to take a look, cause ya know – YOLO. There were all sortsa freaks. Guys in girls jeans, girls in boys shirts wit the checkers on em. One girl had her head shaved and then one dame had hair so long she was sittin on it. I took my place and ordered a Bud but they told me they didn’t have Bud so I says, “Give me the next best thing,” and they gave me some PBR. I was like, Ya know what? That’s good enough for me. Pops drank PBR back before the cancer. Back before the nursin home in Rego Park.,So then this dame comes up to me. She wasn’t sloppy like the girls in Maspeth with their stuffs hangin out, but somehow sloppy like she didn’t brush her hair or somethin. She was wearin these huge glasses like she had serious eye problems so I kinda felt bad for her at first. But then she had on some tight shiny shift wit some dude’s shirt all unbuttoned ova it. I was thinkin – Whose shirt is that? Well, she just rolled right up to me like it was nuttin and she goes, “Um, you’re not from around here, are you?”,Who was she talkin to? Me?! I’m a member of the Dooley clan!,“Not from around here?” I says. “What are ya talkin bout I live right up the road. Are yous from round here?”,“Yeah, I live around the corner.”,“But yous grew up here?”,“No. I grew up in Connecticut.”,“But ya from here?”,“Yeah. I just said I live right around the corner.”,Oh man. I was missin somethin.,Next thing I know she’s talkin to me like, What are you doing over here? And What do you do for a living? I get to tellin her bout the plumbin. How I grew up in Queens. How I was high and checkin out this hood…I was lookin for somethin new since I was stoned wit the cabin fevers and boy did I find it: a bar where people take a shot of whiskey and then follow it wit a shot of juice from a freakin picklejar! People got some strange customs in other hoods, let me tell ya.,She starts talkin to me wit some dreamy voice like she high too, sayin things like, “Queens, I never go to Queens,” and “You know I’ve never hooked up with a guy like you before.” She starts tellin me bout this pizza joint round the corner where they put a farm-on-the-table, whateva that means. She says the brick oven is legit. She says it’s the best freakin pizza in New York City. Then she all flirty and surprised like, “You haven’t been there? Everyone knows it though…it’s the best. SO many writeups.” So I says, “You eva go to Rosas in Maspeth? It don’t need no writeups.”,She shot me a snotty look and says, “Um, no.” And I say, “But it’s right there. In Maspeth. It’s like, a mile away. C’mon! Everybody know Rosas!!”,We go back and forth talkin like we know our pizza better than the other, even though we never tried the other or even hearda it – but it don’t matter cause I know I’m right anyways. Then she just starts makin out wit me outta nowheres! She goes, “You wanna go for a walk?” I told her not really. She tells me how there’s another great bar in the area and how there’s a sushi joint open late or somethins and I’m like, “Nah, I don’t need to see any a that uncooked fish stuffs.” Then she says to me, she goes, “I gotta run. You should come pick me up later. But my ex-boyfriend is crashing at mine so you have to wait until he falls asleep to get me. I’ll call you. Take me back to yours and show me Maspeth.”,I was like, WOAH. Okay. That sounds like a plan even though she’s kinda snobby and maybe hasn’t washed her hair in the past coupla days. Maybe I could talk her into startin out in the showa first, rub in some Head n Shoulders and then we take it to the bedroom. I give her my number and didn’t have no other place to go. I figured I’d chill at mine for a hot second while I waited for her to call. It was only a five minute drive anyways.,Needless to say when I got home I was freakin tired. I fell asleep on my couch after smokin a cigarette, drinkin a Coors Light and watchin recaps from the game. I woke up the next day and checked my phone, worried maybe I missed out on showin this dame a good time. Showin her Maspeth, real New York and Rosas. But as it turned out she neva called me anyway. I guess it’s just who we are, ya know?",,"Bushwick,Cat Agonis,Shanon Weltman,Short story,Sunday Read","

Pets,"Have you always dreamt of adopting a cute little munchkin cat but never got around it? Now it’s easier than ever with ,, a new pet store located on 12 Cypress Ave, you can adopt your kitten right here in Bushwick! ,Pet Superette is a sister store to PS9 Pets on North 9th in Williamsburg and, if you ask us, it’s not just any pet store. Sure, they offer high quality food for your cat, dog, fish, iguana, you name it, and a variety of beds, funny dog outwear, and other pet necessities. Most importantly, however, is that they are really engaged in helping street cats and in cat adoption.,Pet Superette has tw kittens and two adult resident cats who temporarily live in the store and are available for play, foster care or even adoption. Most of the cats are rescues from the Bushwick/Ridgewood area, which is known for a particularly high number of feral cats. I personally brought in Billy Jean, an adorable skinny kitten born in my backyard, who morphed from a scared cat into a leader of kitten mischief in the store. “This morning I came in to the store and it looked like they had a party while we were closed,” laughed Dottie Evans, an employee at the store. Apparently, the kittens managed to rip open a bag of catnip and cat food, and spent the night running around the store, tossing around toys and beds.,In addition to the resident kitties, Pet Superette closely collaborates with a cat rescue organization, , that runs a regular adoption day at Per Superette. , (not Sundays anymore), the organization brings in cats in cages available for adoption or foster care. Members of Kitty Karetakers are present in the store during the adoption day, and they are also very knowledgeable people to consult if you have any questions regarding feral cats living in your backyard or on your block, affordable spay and neuter programs, etc.,As you can imagine, cat rescue and vet services are not exactly cheap. To support this endeavor, you can donate any amount online or in-person at Pet Superette. Additionally, Kitty Karetakers is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit no-kill organization, and the donations are tax-deductable., ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

Music,"Last weekend, we discovered a brand new band, quintet ,. Stone Cold Fox has a young American indie rock sound that’s more than about just partying. Lyrically, every song was crafted beautifully, showing their mature songwriting capabilities. Their set was vibrant, young, nostalgic and reminiscent of the perfect summer NYC night. To my surprise, this Bushwick Music Crush put some much-needed spring fever into my heart. ,Kevin Olken (lead vocalist/guitarist) and Ariel Loh (producer/synth) founded the rock band while attending SUNY Purchase upstate. The duo was later joined by Justin Bright (electric bass/bass synth), Graham Stone (guitar, backup vocals) and David Tedeschi (drums). Kevin Olken has a memorable voice that compliments well with the other bandmates energetic pace. The arrangement and production value are top-quality while still maintaing an organic, unforced feel. Listen to “Stone Cold Fox” by the band above., ,The internet is buzzing with positive feedback for this quintent collab. Their EP, ,, dropped last summer and has gained notable attention. From being featured in , to having their latest video featured on MTV Buzzworthy, the band is gathering a supportive crowd.

Arts and Culture,"Ever heard of Eve Ensler’s play, ,? For those who love the script, missed out on the pop culture phenom, or any of you curious about the inner workings of a woman’s brain, fret not! Bushwick is getting its own dose of pussy power! Led by ,, the, will be presented at , from April 5-7, 2013 and features a cast comprised of seasoned and rookie actresses who interpret the scripts as each woman would - differently.,These inner monologues have been presented a countless number of times, including on the Madison Square Garden stage and a televised production on HBO. The text is beautifully erotic and empowering. Sexual experiences and internal struggles are simultaneously harmonious and jarring. The vagina is put on a pedestal and then scrutinized/adored/questioned. So what’s the reason for another production,?,The onslaught of sexual harassment incidents in Bushwick , motivated Meggie to produce these popular and socially criticized tales. Meggie states that “,is an incredible resource for generating conversations about women’s issues.” She wants to curate engaging discussions about a woman’s experience, and she believes that ,allows for that outlet because “you can engage without using your own words.”,, Meggie invited any and all females to participate. She wanted to open the experience up to the community in hopes that it would provide an outlet for Bushwick women to meet and interact with one another. Part of this community initiative operates on honesty, as each cast member contributes her OWN story to the performances.,All three performances have different casts, totaling 27 edgy and Brooklyn-ified personas. One of the two women performing “My Vagina Was My Village,”,a monologue about a Bosnian rape victim, is a committed career activist for women’s advocacy and health. DiBa, a ,, is incorporating movement into “Reclaiming Cunt” to complement the fluidity of the piece. The woman performing “The Woman Who Liked to Make Vaginas Happy” has participated in two other productions of ,, and is using her role to experiment and challenge herself with a role she customarily would not take. And Meggie’s own mother is performing “I Was There in the Room,” Eve Ensler’s personal monologue about witnessing her grandchild’s birth.,Considering the range in professional performing experience, the cast has integrated warm-up exercises into their rehearsals that work to build on-stage confidence. They are also practicing various acting techniques guided by coaches who are also part of the cast, including members of all-female improv group, The Works. Meggie’s intention when casting the show was “for every woman that was interested in performing to play a role, regardless of her acting experience. A lot of times women are deterred by the competitive nature of auditions or are intimidated by performing on stage. From the beginning, my goal was to foster a supportive community of women that would encourage one another. Activism is at the core of this performance.”",I am interested in immersive experiences of all kinds. Follow me on Twitter @radish10.,"Bushwick,Eve Ensler,Pinebox Rock Shop,The Vagina Monologues","

In the Hood,"I desperately want to say yes to this question, but I really don’t think it’s true for a lot of women. I admire women who are capable of sleeping with someone for the hell of it, but I don’t think it happens as often as the ladies let on. It’s just not cool to say you want to have a relationship with the person you’ve had sex with. If you go there, people will think you’re weak and needy. Ugh!,Well, what if we blame it on biology? I’m sure you’ve heard this before, but let me recap: If the cavewoman had sex and she got pregnant, she’d be stuck with the baby. So she’d only want to f@# a guy she’d want to coerce into helping bring up her brat. Dudes need to fuck a lot of women so they can dominate the tribe. They can’t be that picky or get attached. They need that quantity of pregnant women and offspring to dominate the other dudes. And I’ve got science to back me up. ,Scientific evidence or not, I just don’t think evolution has gotten us past that scenario. I do think there are some women who have evolved past it and we can make them our role models. But for the rest of the ladies, no matter what we in our minds want and act on, we may still feel conflicted in our emotional hot spots after getting it on. Sorry, it sucks. All I’m sayin’ is, sleep with whomever you like, and if you wind up feeling more attached than you expected to, that’s fine. Bear in mind, it may not be something special about the guy – it could just be some leftover cavewoman imprinting. I think we ladies often feel angry because we assume it’s some sort of old person moral judgment that we’re rebelling against. I don’t think you’re being judged; it’s your biology that you’re angry at.,The point I’m making is, ladies, if you get hung up on someone just cause you f*#ked them, don’t make it personal. It’s hormones – they will subside if you don’t keep doing it. And guys, you don’t need to feel so responsible. It’s not you, it’s anybody. Being direct about where everyone is at with the f*#king is key however.,I can see what happened, and I think you can too. She wanted more and likely pretended to you and herself that she wasn’t as interested in having a real boyfriend as she thought. I’m guessing these feelings built up in her – a year and a half is a long time – and when the water boiled, the whistle blew. It’s really no one’s fault; just people not really being honest with themselves and, therefore, with each other. I think you did the right thing, you took her at her word and acted accordingly. You were conscious of how she would feel if you flirted with other women in front of her. And when the accident happened, she jumped to conclusions.,I wish she was able to acknowledge within herself and out loud to you more clearly what she really needed. I also wish there was less of an imbalance between the quantities of available men versus women in this town. And world peace. I wish we could have world peace. And free drinks all Sunday night at every bar in Bushwick. And that I wouldn’t have to spend money to straighten my hair…But, as I was saying, I am left wondering if, after having gotten to know this person over time, you may be relieved in a sense to be unburdened of her. Or are you left completely unscarred by all this, even if you are in the right? I doubt it. I bet you feel bad about what happened, just like I do. And also, she did fulfill some of your needs so I’m sure you will miss her on some level. Are you being honest with yourself about that – you may be hurting a bit too? Who doesn’t want to have someone in their life, besides relatives, who thinks they’re incredible no matter what?,The truth is that guys generally have the upper hand emotionally when it comes to casual sex, so if you don’t want emotional responsibility, the easiest thing to do is to not sleep with one woman regularly. Keep it moving, once a month max, and no long dinners and no cute-next-day-afters, either.","Dr. Lisa, S.P., is a self-proclaimed psychotherapist, artist, performer and comedian.

In the Hood,"Sunday night 19 artists converged in , to compete against one another in a Bob Ross landscape painting takedown.  You may be familiar with the popular , competitions that pit amateur cooks against one another in an attempt to win audience votes and street cred. In the 10 years since its inception, the Takedowns have morphed to include a variety of foods from avocados to cookies! This, however, was the first Takedown that wasn’t culinary, and what better place to host a paint-off than in Bushwick? The Active Space was set up with 19 easels facing the front of the room where repeat episodes of Bob Ross were projected on a screen. Each artist had 1 hour to create their version of a Bob Ross landscape for the chance to win the audience vote and $250 worth of art supplies from Utrecht. That’s a prize worth fighting for.,The Active Space was set up with 19 easels facing the front of the room where repeat episodes of Bob Ross were projected on a screen. Each artist had 1 hour to create their version of a Bob Ross landscape for the chance to win the audience vote and $250 worth of art supplies from Utrecht. While the artists painted away at their landscapes the audience milled around enjoying Sixpoint beers and chili made by host Matt Timms himself. Throughout the night Timms was talkative and actively mingled with the audience encouraging them to drink heavily in preparation for the upcoming auction as the proceeds from the event were going to Meals On Wheels. I asked Timm’s what prompted the shift from culinary to art. He had an energetic response:,As a rule, Takedowns actually have no rules so each artist was free to interpret the painting in their own way. Some went for the literal approach while other artists tended toward the more abstract. When time was up there were traditional landscape paintings of mountains and babbling brooks going head to head with paintings of eyeballs in the sky and an exploding volcano. One artist collaborated with his very young son on a painting that included glitter paint along- side Bob Ross’s face superimposed on a cloud.,Once the artists completed their paintings and the audience cast their ballots it was time for the auction. Timms acting as the exuberant if hilariously inexperienced auctioneer ushered all of the artists to the front of the room and began the bidding. By this time the audience had been drinking for a while and things started to get enjoyably rowdy. Every single painting sold, some of them going for as much as $100 and the auctioneer himself couldn’t help but bid on a few paintings.,The night rounded out with the announcement of Alice Q. Hoang as the the winner of the audience vote and  a $250 gift card  from Utrecht Art Supplies. The event and auction raised $1400 dollars for Meals on Wheels and all in all it was another unique and interesting night in Bushwick. Timm’s summed up the evening  best, “This Takedown is a total experiment and Bushwick is the perfect spot to see if it will succeed or  if it’s a cool idea with legs.

Arts and Culture,"Rain gently pattered on the back window of , library and reading room as the L train roared beneath Bogart Street during a Secret Reading on a Tuesday afternoon a couple of weeks ago. Spectators nestled on couches, the floor and anywhere they could fit inside the intimate space and listened intently to author Cameron Pierce, of Portland’s ,, read from his book ,.,There are now more books on the walls, more makeshift shelves, more events planned and more bodies reading books on the couches on any given day. In fact, Tonight, Wednesday, March 27,  at 7 p.m. Mellow Pages will host a reading by , and ,own ,, where she will read from her new novel ,. This is life now for Jacob Perkins and Matt Nelson, the creators of the independent library, which ,.,“The response was more positive than we expected,” Perkins says of the library’s opening on Thursday, February 21.,“We hit a nerve,” adds Nelson.,About 60 people swung by Mellow Pages on opening day to browse the shelves and drink a beer. Since then, the library has added 50 new members who each donated the required 10 books membership “fee” to join. Total, the guys have added about 600 books, and counting, through donations from people, with one patron donating 180 books. In total, Mellow Pages’s is reaching 1,200 pieces, including zines.,“We’ve also contacted many publishers and have had lots of packages show up.

However, there have been a few changes. The opening hours will now be 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. and they’re considering eliminating the alternative $20 membership fee and simply having a 10-book donation fee. The guys have also refined their ideas for hosting events.,“Instead of just having an ‘anything goes/no structure’ thing, we’ve been thinking of specific events and directly asking people to get involved,” Nelson said.,As we mentioned, tonight, Wednesday, March 27,  at 7 p.m. Mellow Pages will host a reading by , and ,own ,, where she will read from her new novel ,.,Mellow Pages is also hosting the , reading series on Saturday, March 30.

In the Hood,"Last week we told you the ways ,‘. In our comments section, readers ended up showing some love for its parallel sister train, the J! Though it has a bad rap, the J/M/Z  train line is actually pretty dope- it runs frequently, rarely has back-ups and delays like the L and it spans a lot of territory. While the L train has its selling points, here are quite a few ways the J train totally trumps the L., Do you like it when your train is harder to get into than a Saturday at the Boom Boom Room? –Of course you don’t!! While the J train isn’t exactly a picnic at McCarren Park during rush hour, it  feels like one compared to the L, which is just a straight up sardine-can. You can stand without touching at least 3 undesirable characters, or even (gasp!) grab a seat!, , As commenter Sean pointed out on last week’s article, “One thing I always enjoyed about the J train was cell-service while riding into Manhattan. Always offered the chance to pop off those ‘I’m running late’ texts and simultaneously blame the J” (in real time).  Nuff’ said, Sean. Nuff said. Riding this line frees up some great email-checking time, too., If you live between the Myrtle and Marcy stops, not only do you have the J, you have the M train. During the week, the M brings you to essential spots in Manhattan like the LES, and if you’re about the office kind of life, places like Rockefeller Center. But even if you don’t live off these stops, fret not–you can still catch the M from any of these stations on the exact same platform which is simply grand for those of us who don’t like doing their cardio on subway stairs., The J/M/Z train has a breathtaking ride over the Williamsburg bridge, with views of Manhattan’s east side and all the way down to the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges. It’s a little know benefit of train riding that has yet to make it into a tourist tips guidebook ., Know what friggin sucks? Traveling on a long-ass trip where you missed your layover and then you have to take multiple trains to get home at 1 in the a.m. At least if you live off the J, you can take it direct to the AirTrain to get to & fro to JFK instead of lifting your damn suitcase up and down a bajillion stairs at Broadway Junction. Hopefully you’re going to the JetBlue terminal to enjoy some cocktails and the Boar’s Head kiosk: an O.G. of Bushwick!, The J runs express, and the Z runs even more express. Seriously, L. Get it together.,So what do YOU think? Does the J train trump the L overall? Which line do you prefer? Drop a note in the comments to get the conversation going!","To me, life is meant to be classy-trashy. Nothing’s better than bouncing from a rooftop terrace-soiree and rolling into a warehouse party in the same leopard-print dress.

With the influx of bars in Bushwick’s always-residential streets, there’s been little enforcement with keeping noise levels low, and that’s gotten to many residents.,While the new rule is obviously not going to be too popular with area bars, it will be interesting to see how the policy, which is just advisory unless approved by the State Liquor Authority, plays out going forward.

Music,"The latest artist to land on our radar is the female rapper going by the name ,. We’re all for educated, witty females poking fun and attacking the heavily male dominated music industry. Girls just want to have fun and this 24 year old woman repping Queens knows just how to play. Her latest single, “My Vag” is a smart and catchy parody of that macho tune we all reluctantly had stuck in our heads a while back- ,‘s “,“. “It’s a celebration of women,” Awkwafina said. “There aren’t a lot of songs out there talking about vaginas in an in-your-face kind of way.”,Awkwafina is a , veteran and , graduate who decided to put Corporate America on the back burner to pursue her artistic endeavors outside of the bull pen. As you may know LaGuardia High has paved the way for well-known female rappers , and ,. Residing in Brooklyn, Awkwafina keeps it thorough by means of lyrical comedic relief. Rapping about anything – from flu shots and HIV, to Patty Mayonnaise and sippin’ on Stoli and Capri Suns – she’s definitely our type of caliber.,Her latest track picking up buzz  is “,“, a blunt attack at the Mickey Avalon song “,“ from a few years back. Awkwafina pretty much takes him to school proving that men aren’t the only rappers who can comment about in a comedic (yet prideful) way about genitals. When the video for My Vag originally dropped, Awkwafina received a bit of flack from those easily offended by someone talking about their vagina in a way that doesn’t compare it to a precious rose of a genital. But then Buzzfeed claimed that she’d “,” and her video was actually picked up by feminist websites The Hairpin and The Frisky. And while some people remain offended by her ludeness, she says that’s just her, and her goal is to make people laugh. “Other female rappers are overly sexual, have no wit, and their lyrics are so generic,” Awkwafina said (,) “I want to change the game to make rap that shows I’m not a normal female rapper—it’s not about how rich I am, how much sex I have, or how many boyfriends I have. That’s just not me.”,So, what does she have to say about her Vag exactly? Watch the video below and read over some of our fave lude comparisons….,While “My Vag” feels like an analogy question from an SAT test…,Over here at Bushwick Daily, we feel no need to label her – Asian, Lesbian, Straight, Feminist, Hipster or whatever other stereotype the media world has felt inclined to appropriate.

Arts and Culture,"s ,, there was Williamsburg/Bushwick-based web series ,from creator ,.  The series hilariously captures the exasperation of being a single and lonely hipster in New York, as well as the struggles of financially surviving as a freelancer – all within five-minute webisodes. The show has been compared to the likes of ,, ,, ,, ,, and of course, the inevitable referral to ,. Unlike ,, however, , is from a low-budget show from a man’s point of view, more like two dudes gathering laundry and complaining about how dirty the subway is.,Season one, which first aired in January last year, begins with the end of Rob’s relationship, where he is shoved into the depths of the big New York singles sea. This quote, from the protagonist, sums up the sappy view this sensitive guy has on true love:,“I hate parties. I don’t want to do that. I want to go home, stay at home,” Rob sulks to a friend in episode one. “The other day, together, we baked two pumpkin pies and ate both of them in two days – that’s love.”,We sat down with Hugel himself for an exclusive Q+A.,“I moved here, got into a relationship quickly, a four-five month thing, it ended and I suddenly realized ‘I live here and I don’t have many friends.’ I had friends, but no best buds or a strong community. The harsh reality was ‘I’m lonely.’ And I didn’t want to do the regular and popular thing, like go out a lot and celebrate being single.”,During that period, the Virginia native was freelancing various video production gigs and working retail to earn a living. This left Hugel with a lot of free time on his hands at odd hours while everyone else was working full-time jobs. This explains why Rob, the show’s protagonist, is often left wandering around Williamsburg and even befriends his banker.,Hugel does an extraordinary job of developing Rob’s character in those five-minute episodes, probably because he was that lonely and naive Rob at a previous point in his life. As a viewer, you sympathize with Rob, feel sorry for him and understand his love-hate relationship with New York, all while rooting for him; you want Rob to get over his girlfriend, move on and find a good job and a girl. In short, , is addicting for their sheer relatability, especially since the episodes are so short. They’re almost like vignettes, or days-in-the-life of your single best friend.,The series also does an excellent job of illustrating those self-conscious, lack-of-financial stability moments I’m sure many residents in our neighborhood can relate to, like dealing with that cute girl working for the , asking if you like children.,“How do you guys afford to get brunch every single week,” Rob asks in episode two after being obligated to at least order an orange juice at a restaurant.,“We have jobs,” Rob’s friends respond.,“I have ,. I have multiple video production jobs…They just don’t happen, you know, on a normal time frame,” Rob says.,Hugel said, while , is based on his life, it’s not entirely true. He says the story lines veer off into decisions he wishes he’d made or that will be more interesting for the show. While the show may share many similarities to HBO’s ,, including the setting, Hugel said he is inspired by shows like ,, ,(UK version), and ,Hugel began scripting , in 2010 after taking several improv courses at the , (UCB), and editing and producing ,web series, which is created by , and ,. He began filming the episodes in 2011. However, a year passed before he was able to release them.,“I wanted to do it like TV, where a season gets shot, you edit it, and release it. But it was difficult because the process of filming was slow,” Hugel said. “But it was worth the wait.”,Before Hugel finished filming and editing the entire series, before releasing it on ,, and long before , premiered, he submitted some of the episodes to the , in 2011. The show won the Audience Choice Award.,“I had never done a festival, never shown anything I had made, especially something that was so personal and which I had put so much effort into. Winning inspired me to make more,” Hugel said.,Since its release, , has received more than 4 million views. Hugel has also created more content, including the , where he offers relationship advice, spin-off show ,and , where Hugel - the real Rob – discusses whatever he wants. He’s also working on another spin-off show, ,The show,was also screened before each episode of , at , Bar in Williamsburg.,Season one ends with Rob joining a singles-cult full of men who live on a secret boat learning to embrace singledom, reminiscent of , ridiculous circle of pickup artists. Will Rob regain his mojo? Will he stop being a vegetarian? Will he win his ex-girlfriend back? You’ll have to keep watching to find out. And, in case you’re wondering whether Hugel is single.

But this addition to the wide array of small businesses popping up in the ‘hood is one that was sorely needed. Bushwick Art & Shipping Inc. brings together all of the art supplies that previously were spread out, scarce, or just plain inaccessible all under one roof. With a very convenient location (on Flushing, just steps from the Morgan L stop), this diverse store houses art supplies, a shipping center which is FedEx, USPS, and Postal Service certified, and a vintage boutique, making it a one-stop-shop for many locals.

Arts and Culture,"This Saturday’s birth in the art world of Bushwick came by the name of Transfer Gallery opening Alexandra Gorczynski’s debut solo show. The show called Truisms reflects Alexandra’s reflections on the baby making that is happening today between art and technology. Her work brings the two worlds together by applying the raw sensibility of the physical world into the photoshopped digital world. With every piece of work we witnessed this juxtaposition, the same way we witness our dual selves every day we switch back and forth from Facebook to real life.,Alexandra, as a new media folk artist has been exploring  her own personal digital tales. By painting the Aurora desktop image on the wall of the gallery, she brought her own warmth to that digital environment that we live in everyday. As one member of the audience observed, this desktop image is for a lot of people today’s industrial environment. With three paintings based on complimentary colors she brought about the paradox of Wacom being a painting tool but nobody actually painting with or on it. Works with titles like “Vagina.PSD” and “Hippie shit” encapsulated this physical/digital juxtaposition with the title also being the file name, adding a digital layer of story to her work (some pun intended).,For that reason, this exhibition was ideal to the birthing of the Transfer Gallery, which according to its proud “parents” Kelani Nichole and Jereme Mongeon will be exploring the tension of the physicality of bringing new media art in a space. When asked about how they decided to make this gallery happen, Kelani was categorical: “We just wanted to fucking do it.”,Every birth is a laborious process and putting together the show was a difficult procedure, but it all came together in a packed opening with the audience engaging in conversations about the physical and the digital. Some people believed in the distinction between the two, whereas other were of the idea: “It doesn’t have to be one or the other, they are now blending together.” One could observe that with people digitally recording, through Instagram and other imaging apps, their physical art viewing experience is also becoming a part of that conversation.,Whichever your side, Alexandra’s artistic baby making will make you think and see this continuous debate through her own eyes. Literally and figuratively since her eyes are also very present in a lot of works.",An explorer of sorts.

For our local emerging and mid-life choreographers we have a curated 8 show series titled the “The 2Night Show.” These shows are a collective of 4 – 5 choreographers with pieces that range from solo works to group pieces. In total we present 32 – 40 local choreographers per year.,Unfortunately we no longer present on site at Chez, as our capacity restrictions are set at 25, which is not conducive to a very robust event. Instead we present at our sister organization , (CPR) that was originated by our founder Jonah Bokaer with John Jasperse of ,. We do try to work on site in our studio as much as possible by hosting monthly Work in Progress showings for our studio members, open rehearsals when we have a company in residence, and participate in ,.

We work large, with small resources, and are known by many in the Brooklyn dance community, larger New York area, US, and internationally. Currently, we are looking to expand our local impact by creating a formal residency program, developing talent through our studio and presenting programs, and re-engaging in one of our local schools, PS147.,I’m usually too busy making sure all the parts of the show are working to sit down and actually enjoy a performance, however there was a 2Night show curated by Lindsay Clark that comes to mind.

Your journey will be rewarded as it will lead you to the wonderful solo exhibition of , and his bright and colorful, almost monstrous creations. The show is a collection of larger than life fabric constructions that seem to actually leap off their walls and defy their very two-dimensionality. I had the good fortune to experience the lively and unique exhibition during its opening, which coincided with Bushwick Armory Night. As one of a number of other participating galleries in the Bogart building alone, Tim Zercie’s , was a standout exhibition for a night abounding with competition.,When I first confronted the figures, I did not know quite what to make of them. This in and of itself is a good first impression. Completely non-derivative and unexpected, the wondrous works each possess their own personalities that are at first unnerving, yet convey a liveliness and true humanity.  Reminiscent of ,, Zercie’s works also possess a theatricality and whimsy of Mexican , masks with their vivid colors and well-crafted personas. The similarities to these artists, however, end on a surface level. While some are humorous and engaging, others are melancholy, pensive, or even depicted in mid-decapitation. In all instances, Zercie challenges our preconceived notions of character and figurative depiction.,Zercie’s main font of inspiration comes from a fascination with spiritual ritualism, deriving from occult sources such as ,, ,, ,, ,, and ,, tied together through their mystic and magical capabilities. Zercie literally embodies the mystical texts, channeling the demon, spirit, angel or whichever other deity one chooses to relate to, in his creations. The way Zercie personifies these ancient sources is juxtaposed by their contemporary contexts. In our daily lives, where mysticism has been reduced to a palm reader, Tarot cards and the latest episode of ,, how does today’s popular media-driven culture view the symbolic, the magical, or the occult?,The answer to this question is both simple and complicated. Since the rise of , and continuing with artists working today, it often happens that an artwork possesses its own self-fulfilling prophecy. Works that are created in order to question, parody or critique modern cultural normalcy end up becoming an entrenched part of that very culture. (Case in point: VIP cardholders at the Armory Show two weeks ago were sent home with their very own , as souvenirs from contemporary artist ,.) This form of culturally , art is easy to digest and gallery goers “get it.” Even the criticism that it raises tends to make those participating in these culturally specific endeavors feel better about themselves for being a part of the entire contemporary moment. Zercie’s manifestations do not attempt to present something we already know or are familiar with. Unless you are well-versed in the ancient esoteric religious rites, there is no way you are on familiar ground. This uneven territory makes the work immediately easy to dismiss as bizarre or strange. Although I cannot feign my own expertise, or pretend that I am now going to read all of the ancient texts, I am still interested in creating contemporary connections that are drawn based on the timelessness of arcane religion. They say all art history is in flux, waiting to be reinterpreted by each new contemporary audience. Then how is this art, with its underground and seemingly obscured allusions, relevant today?,We might always be in the process of trying to uncover the “universal truths” of existence. In their own way, the esoteric orders on which Zercie’s work is shaped are seeking to derive their own answers to age-old questions, outside of the mainstream of more unified religions. Zercie’s “conjurations,” as he names them, have the ancient quality of mysticism and mystery about them, yet tap into our basic needs of something to venerate, loath or fear. By attaching a face to these instincts, gazing into Zercie’s figures is like looking into a mirror back into ourselves. By stepping away from the contemporaneous worries and concerns that will soon expire with a new season, Zercie creates a more timeless exhibition that can and will resonate with a number of different audiences for, hopefully, years to come.,Caught between a temple and a funhouse, the exhibition is both familiar yet intimidating, grotesque and humorous, causing our preconceived notions of what to expect to dissolve as quickly as we attempt to create them.,A Family Conjuration ","Allison Galgiani is a writer and fine arts professional from Tucson, AZ, and now lives in Bushwick.

"Arts and Culture,People","WAXworks, a strand of the ,, will host a showcase for emerging choreographers at , this Sunday, March 24th. WAX currently does not have a permanent home, but the show must go on!,Denizens of Brooklyn, new and old, are familiar with the words “luxury condos” and what inevitable changes those two words will bring to their respective neighborhoods. WAX is no stranger to this. In 1999, co-founders Marisa Beatty, Brian Brooks, Melissa Rodnon and David Tirosh renovated a one story warehouse in the heart of Williamsburg at 205 North 7th Street – turning the space into a “professional white-box theater.” From September 2000 to October 2004, WAX served as a hub for artists in a not-yet-famous ‘hood where rent was cheap and the streets were mean(er). Offering affordable rehearsal space, a visual arts gallery and a fully equipped theater that could host productions for ANY type of artist, WAX opened its doors to nearly 500 creative minds.,In 2004, the building was sold to developers and WAX was stranded with ideas and equipment and nowhere to go. But instead of closing for good, WAX embarked on what they’re calling “Phase II” and created ,, a series of performance showcases offering new and veteran artists an opportunity to perform on a professional stage. With the help of Triskelion Arts, WAXworks is producing these showcases once a month, from February until June, and can continue with its founding mission.,For a nominal fee, choreographers can present work up to 12-minutes long and receive a half hour tech slot, objective feedback from audience members, and a video of the performance. WAXworks also offers advice on artist statements, press kits and more – part of their “learn-by-doing” method of preparing.,I spoke with ,, one of the choreographers presenting at the March showcase, about her process. Here’s what she had to say…,How did you hear about WAXworks?, From rehearsing at Triskelion. I was renting space and saw it on their bulletin board. I just decided I needed to set a date to make work and follow through., What was the submission process like?, They wanted to know about who you are as a dancer/artist. There was an application form to talk about your work and describe what you would like to show and a small fee. I just gave them all I had and hoped for the best., Where did the moniker “Crooked Mouth” spawn from?, My last name. Campbell is Scottish and apparently means “crooked mouth,” which apparently also means “liar.” I like it because I feel there are so many ideas and different types of movement I want to present as I work on building a body of work. Having a name like “Crooked Mouth” makes me feel free to do that. Like, “Oh you thought I was going to be this type of artist and make this kind of dance, sorry I lied, I’m switching it up again.”,The idea of “lying” in terms of audience and performance is also interesting. Is what the audience sees actually who and what we are at that time? What part of it are we acting? What part of it is personal? I like playing around with it all., What are you hoping to showcase with your choreography for the March 24th showing?, All the things! It’s hard because I want to cram all these ideas I’ve been having over the past few years into the first big thing I’m actually presenting, so I’ve been trying to sift and filter it down to a few things. It’s based on a school dance, which is a pretty basic concept, but also for me, brings to mind a whole slew of emotions: love, fear, regret, desire, insecurity.,It’s also kind of funny. Going to a dance as a kid was a pretty big deal, but in the “big picture” it’s just another day in your life. Looking back, the fondest memory I have of prom or whatever is how awesome my dress was.,The , in “West Side Story” is another inspiration. I’m trying to let the dance idea be the filter for the rollercoaster of emotions I’ve had – and will still go through – while trying to make it sassy and funny. The dancing is athletic and big, but I also want it to be a little raw with some personality shining through. I’m working with a bunch of amazing dancers who have diverse training and work in nightlife., Do you think WAXworks is an important platform for emerging Brooklyn choreographers? Why or why not?, I think so. They’re gracious enough let me to emerge! Just having the opportunity to make and present work is important, and also the opportunity to meet and see some other rad dancers and choreographers too. Being affiliated with a space like Triskelion is also helpful, it’s a great space.",I am interested in immersive experiences of all kinds.

"Featured,In the Hood","“This is Bushwick, baby – where anything can happen,” exclaims Willie Jr., the main protagonist in ,, the Bushwick-set web series. , is like the Puerto Rican version of ,, where everybody knows your name, but they’re not necessarily happy you came – and they’re not shy about letting you know, either.,The show’s second season, which humorously depicts Bushwick’s Puerto Rican community clinging to its culture and neighborhood in the face of gentrification – or as the show insinuates, the “oncoming yuppie invasion” – premiered on March 19 with a special screening at Bryant Park Hotel in Manhattan. The series, created by Julia Ahumada Grob and Yamin Segal, includes 12 episodes, of which only six have been filmed. A new episode will be released every two weeks through May on the show’s , beginning March 20, with the first two shows already available.,The six to nine-minute episodes chronicle the hijinks of Willie Jr. (,) as he tries to keep his sports bar a float and tries to win back his ex-fiancé from his arch nemesis, Albert. The show also highlights the many recognizable quirky caricatures of Bushwick, represented by the primarily Latino characters, including the bodega CEO, piragua (shaved ice) purveyors, local artists, family drunks, sassy women, local beggars, salsa music lovers, as well as the unwanted “hipsters.”, tackles themes such as unrequited love, family relationships, identity, stardom aspirations, sexuality, hybrid skin colors/cultures, fear of change, rising rents, entrepreneurship, and gentrification, which instigates a well-known divide between the areas “original tenants” and the growing ,. The show is filled with the authentic sounds and looks of Bushwick, funny one-liners, well-developed characters and great establishing shots of the colorful ‘hood we know and love.,Bushwick residents, as well as residents of other gentrified New York boroughs, will quickly see themselves in some of the token characters. Specifically, Bushwick residents will also laugh at inside local jokes, such as the proper way to refer to Bushwick (hint: not, East Williamsburg) or the silliness – or brilliance, depending on which side you’re on – of incorporating yoga in a bar (I’m looking at you ,).,The show does an amusing job of portraying greedy real estate agents selling small cramped apartments to young, non-native New Yorkers with the promise of being close to Williamsburg.,“I’m talking about the L train a block away, the JMZ two blocks away, Brooklyn Bowl, Meatball Shop and Williamsburg bars around the corner,” the creepy agent tells future tenants right before closing the deal by throwing in the ultimate “panty-dropper” – a kegerator. And also right before all three get pelted by eggs thrown by a moo moo-wearing, long-time resident hysterically screaming, “There will be no panty dropping in my back yard! This is Jesus’ house!”,Grob, who also stars as Ceci Rivera in the show, said the show’s target audience is the new generation of Latinos who are educated, identify with hip-hop culture and are between 25 and 40 years old. Segal, the show’s other creator and lead star Navaja, both said that the show is one that all U.S.-born Latinos can relate to, regardless of which ethnicity they represent.,However, , makes many specific cultural references, which if you’re not familiar with Puerto Rican culture (like me) means you will miss most of the jokes. The only one I got was the corny “Fake Anthony” name-calling referencing Puerto Rican-American singer Mark Anthony.,The show also depicts, and potentially reinforces, the divide between the different Latin American cultures in New York by overtly mocking Mexicans and jokingly threatening a Salvadorian in the first episode. “I’m gonna piss on you… I’m a make a road block, and the only people allowed in are Puerto Ricans. So if your flag doesn’t have that one white star—you outta here. You know why it’s white? Because it ain’t Mexican, playa,” [sic] a character tells Edgar, the show’s Salvadorian artist character.,As a self-proclaimed Texican (a Mexican-American hailing from Texas) living in South Williamsburg, one would think I’d easily identify with the target audience. Instead, I felt insulted and was reminded of the negative instances, albeit few, I’ve experienced from Puerto Ricans in New York for being of Mexican descent. I can’t help but wonder whether that’s the Puerto Rican consensus on Mexicans? If so, why?,I also felt as if I had to choose between identifying with either the Puerto Ricans, which are supposed to represent all Latin Americans, or the unwanted hipsters. If I had to choose, I’d probably choose the unwanted hipsters. And, as a hipster viewer, I’d probably also feel insulted with the show’s overt hipster-bashing. I understand these hipsters are bringing unwanted change to the neighborhood for long-time residents, but they’re also doing good things for it too, things that ,strives to chronicle while also keeping the stories of the original residents alive to demonstrate what a great and vibrant neighborhood Bushwick is because of all these mix of characters and cultures.,As Dave Wondrich, , drinks writer, ,: “[At] least the YUTs [Young Urban Tradesmen] are neat and constructive, things the punks and the hippies and the beatniks before them were most assuredly not… Hipsters might be parasites, but at least they leave the host alive.”,As with many new shows filmed in and around Bushwick, , has been described as an alternative to HBO’s ,, which was created by Lena Dunham. While ,, primarily set in Greenpoint and Williamsburg, is criticized for being homogenous and white, at least it doesn’t directly insult particular races or ethnicities. Rather than broadly calling itself a “Latino story” or a show aimed at all Latinos, , should simply call itself a primarily Puerto Rican story aimed at Puerto Ricans. It doesn’t mean non-Puerto Ricans shouldn’t watch, but at least we have a better idea of what to expect.,Nonetheless, I think the show is professionally shot, especially given its minuscule budget, and it has a lot of potential to be turned into a longer series. And it’s always great to have different perspectives represented, especially minority voices. It can only serve to give a more holistic view, and perhaps will encourage other voices to come forth in the future.",,"Bushwick,East WillyB,HBO Girls,hipsters,Julia Ahumada Grob,Puerto Ricans,web series,Yamin Segal","

"Arts and Culture,In the Hood","Just when we thought spring was upon us, another late snow and chilly temperatures make us all want to curl up with a good book and a hot toddy. Before you don your Snuggie and slippers, check out these five art events this week that are sure to heat you up and give you reason to brave the last dreary days of winter in anticipation for warmer days ahead!,With ten years on the New York art scene under his belt, David Kesting has decided to open the doors of his first solo venture, David Kesting Presents, in the heart of Bushwick. Artist , work draws from a myriad of sources, yet all arise from his experience growing up in New York City. Whether confronting issues of safe sex in high school or presenting technicolor depictions of the Twin Towers, Leo’s work is bound together by his love affair with New York City and the trials and tribulations that come from that relationship. As part of the exhibition, Leo will transform a section of gallery into a replica of his studio in the same spirit of other NYC-inspired installations, such as Calus Oldenburg’s , (1961), , (1964), and , (1986-2005). Paying homage to, yet distancing himself from, his predecessors, Leo’s studio installation will allow a conflation of public and private as the artist lets visitors encounter the intimacy involved in the artist’s process. (,), ,Celebrating two very different mediums, , and , will join forces for their first ever collaboration at Interstate Projects. DeYoung’s animated videos alongside Westbrook’s colorful collage aims to transport visitors on an expedition to distant lands, as the title “Diamon Head,” referencing a Hawaiian volcano, would suggest. The concept of transporting oneself through mediation of the senses is fully embraced, making it possible to travel by proxy through depictions of the bizarre and fantastical worlds of DeYoung and Westbrook. (,), ,No matter how prepared you might think you are for a performance at Grace Exhibition Space, somehow there is always something new/shocking/surprising/awesome to discover! This Friday’s performance will surely prove to be no exception with a superb lineup of artists. Whether focusing on the environment, the body and presence, gender and identity, or our urban environment, all four performances are sure to question, provoke and invite dialogue and debate. Rather than us trying to present a synopsis of the performance, make sure to be there on Friday to check it out yourself! As always, Grace Exhibition Space requests a $10 donation for their performances to enable them to continue to provide thoughtful and engaging performance art to the community. (,), ,If you happen to stray from the Bushwick warehouses and find yourselves in the Greenpoint warehouses, get your rock on and visit the opening of Huyn Jung Cho’s , exhibition. She is ”just a small town girl, livin’ in a lonely world” who appropriates found objects, such as discarded mechanical parts and other  industrial materials, combined with rock and roll nostalgia. And yes, writing about this exhibition at the , definitely required the use of some Journey lyrics. , ,If you missed the opening for , show, fret not! This Sunday, AIRPLANE will be bringing the artists in for an evening of experimental music that will compliment his installation on display. According to the AIRPLANE press release, Butler’s installation is “an interactive sculptural instrument that can be played like a piano but projects light onto the wall in an endless variety of patterns and shapes.” This Sunday’s performance is one in a series of events to surround the exhibition, which will include seminars, demonstrations, and other collaborative performances.

In the Hood,"I got this invite a few weeks ago and could tell right away it was totally up my alley: ,It had my three favorite keywords: art, sex and booze. ,I attended both the opening and the speed dating party. First of all, the art was great and you still have another week to see the show, so head over to Art Helix and check it out. I focused on the artists themselves. Why were all these young, attractive people single? What did they really want in terms of dating and relationships? Would they be interested in any Dr. Lisa advice?,I managed to do a little speed therapy on all the GOOD-LOOKING artists. See if you can identify with one or more of them and you may gain some insight on your own issues. Or maybe you would like to go on a date with one of these talented, attractive artists? If so, say hi to them in the comments!, (Yes, she really does make a living!),More than 10 years. Oy, time makes fools of us all., It’s better than being trapped in a loveless marriage for the sake of children who don’t appreciate you and will never call when you’re old? (I’m assuming.) I prefer being in a steady, exclusive, long-term relationship, but I appreciate the freedom singledom has afforded me., I guess I’m still single because I haven’t found the right person. Or more likely that I choose the wrong people. It can also be extremely difficult to choose someone if there are so many great options. That, or my crippling fear of kittens.,I hadn’t really thought about singledom and dating being competitive before, but I found myself somewhat eyeing up the other artists. After a fleeing moment of “Bitches, it’s ON,” I went back to reality and I remembered there’s no such thing as competitive dating. I also usually don’t mention my work while meeting people, so this was the first time my creative self played a factor in my mingling. And I did meet several really nice people., Lake is a bombshell and said she liked nerdy guys. Lake’s all into ,and ,that kind of stuff. From her reaction I don’t think she realizes how intimidating she is to guys who are not sexually aggressive and competitive. I think it would be good to try to make a less aggressive guy feel powerful by focusing all her energy on him. That way they could both forget what a bombshell she is and observe whether or not they’re enjoying each other’s company., ,7 months., Pretty okay about it. It gives me time to focus on my career and life., I guess finding someone who is at the same point in his life as I am, i.e. a path of work that he’s passionate about. Also, recently moving to a new city from my hometown definitely shakes up established relationships.,It didn’t affect them too much. And while I didn’t meet anyone new that I could date per se, it is always a wonderful experience to expose your art to new viewers. That was my goal, first and foremost., Zachary is new to town. From chatting with Zach, I’d say he’s a charismatic guy and lives with a close friend so I think he has a stable home base, wants to have a good time, and he seems adept at meeting people. I say, “Live it up Zachary. You have plenty of time to settle down.”, ,3 years.,Not sure I generally have feelings about being single. It is more like I have a natural urge to want to share my life with someone; so do most people. Maybe I have instincts about being with someone.,I am a horrible person and I smell. Honestly, I’m not really a dater. I just want something to happen naturally, like puberty. Maybe less awkward than that, if possible.,I didn’t meet anyone romantically. My feelings about dating are the same, I guess. It is just important for one to be true to oneself and the rest will fall into place. It would be nice to be with someone, but I’m not in a rush. I’m thinking about grad school, work, and the rest of my life., While I enjoyed meeting Rebeca, I didn’t feel like she needed me to butt into her business. She was pleased to be in the show, but I was left wondering why she was bothering with a dating website, since she didn’t seem interested in focusing her energy on dating at this point in her life., , 8 months.,Before I came out, I loved being single. I had all the time in the world to work on my artwork during the day and go out at night; it was a routine I got used to. Since moving to NY I’ve decided to really pursue dating because I felt more confident with my sexuality and I didn’t see the point in waiting any longer. Now I do enjoy being single; I am in no rush to be in a relationship. I do keep my eyes peeled and go on many dates because sometimes you just never know if you might hit it off with someone.,I am still single because I fully came out last September. Though I was aware of my sexuality for a while, so it wasn’t a complete transitionary shock. New York has been a great place to explore my sexuality and I feel like I have definitely made up for lost time. I feel more invigorated about life now; being a late bloomer doesn’t bother me at all. At 25, it’s great to be able to say that life feels brand new.,Surprisingly I had a lot of gay men come up, talk to me and decide right there that we should be friends, and I agreed! Double date instead? I’m for it. The show was a fun experience for me. It brought out my inner child, like when you are in grade school and you go to your first dance. I did have some people that I had gone out on dates before come to the show, which definitely said something. Being single brought this experience to me, so being solo and on the hunt definitely has its perks., I’ll say the same thing to Beata as I did to Zachary. Beata is also new to town, plus she’s newly out as a lesbian. She’s a very charming, young lady who just doesn’t seem lonely to me. So live it up Beata! You have plenty of time to settle down., , 3.5 years.,Overall, I feel good about it because it has allowed me to put a lot of my energy into myself first and become successful in NY. In other words, I’ve been solidifying my own foundation and I believe I am now ready for a long-term relationship.,Historically, I have jumped into exclusive relationships quickly and found myself trying to make it work when I knew in my heart that it wasn’t what I wanted. I also believe that I wasn’t living my own life as balanced as I could so I wasn’t attracting partners who were at a place in their life to have a serious relationship either. I have taken the last year to slow down and discover my authentic wants and needs so that I can recognize when it’s a good fit.,I felt shy and a little fearful about it at first, but the group setting put me at ease. I met a lot of great people through participating in the show, including the other artists. I found it fun and it was an awesome alternative to online dating. I felt like it took the pressure off of the idea of reading first impressions because I got to see my potential dates talking with other people besides me and vice versa. Body language tells a lot about a person.,When I talked to Autumn, I got a sense that some of her relationships had a little bit of too much mutual dependency. Some time on her own is necessary for growth so she doesn’t continue a pattern of settling down too quickly. I feel good about Autumn’s future. She said something cool to me: “The more open I am to people I meet, the more open I am period.”, , I think Juan should hook up with Zachary., ,web designer/developer.,3 years.,I’d prefer not to be, but I’m okay with it.,Because I’m very particular about the types of people that I choose to spend my time with.,It was nice to go to an event with other people in the same position as myself. It makes you realize that there are plenty of people who are outgoing enough and also want to be in a relationship. I was a little disappointed that the focus seemed on relationships as opposed to art, largely because I would imagine art is so personal. Putting the artist next to their art would make it difficult to look at without feeling self-conscious. I met many people, and have a date with one person that was kind of off the books. Probably better that way, we’ll see how it goes.,From my conversation with Jordon, I got the feeling that he was very picky about who he spends time with, friends included. I think that Jordon may be a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to finding people he enjoys spending time with. That’s not to say he doesn’t really like people - he spoke glowingly of his friends. I worry that Jordon may have very specific expectations of the women he dates and it will take him a long time to meet “the right person.” Also, when he does, he may be disappointed when he gets to know them if they don’t turn out to be the way he imagined. However, I am super happy that he made a date with someone that he met from the show!, , My entire life., I don’t mind it, though I would rather be in a relationship.,Just haven’t found that perfect partner in crime yet., Made me wonder If I do these things because I want to have a few crazy stories or if I’m lonely? Maybe it’s a bit of both?, I got the impression that Sam is getting laid enough and says he enjoys dating because he “likes talking to strangers and doing different things.” I love his attitude!

"Featured,In the Hood","Aaaaah, the L train. Why do we love it? Well, the answers are obvious! Everyone wants access to easy train transfers, and Union Square is on the line. If you’re like everyone else who lives in Brooklyn and into food and bars, there are a plethora of sweet places to fill up near most every L stop. It’s basically a fashion show, with outfits and makeup worthy of a half-baked red train carpet. It’s also a way to get where you’re going and take in some serious eye candy at the same time. But holdup! The L train isn’t all wine n’ roses either. Ever heard of , ? Let’s all commiserate for a hot second on how trifling this train can be. Damn you, L!, While no train is a walk in the park during the hours of 7:30-9 a.m., the L train is the mecca offender of claustrophobia, forcing you to know what the person next to you had for breakfast or when the last time they showered was. It’s the worst for the Bedford & Lorimer folk where the over-population begins on the platform, and they then have to wait for several trains before hopping on. Sardine-can City, yo., Admit it. You try and take the F or the A as much as possible whenever you have to do a west-side transfer. None of us look forward to avenue-long walk in a tunnel of grim, doom, and silly advertisements for Bravo reality shows. Although that really happy guy who always sings Beatles covers IS a delight. You gotta hand it to him–he makes it all a little better. He really does., Don’t you sometimes wish you could just bypass 3rd Ave and Graham Ave? Can’t the sum total of 8 people who actually use these stops walk literally 3 extra blocks or less to the next nearest subway station? Or maybe the MTA should just run those stations like they do on the bus where you pull a cord if you need the bus to stop. That would be so awesome!, Okay. It’s time certain L train riders take off their flippin sunglasses and headphones already, and stop pretending like they don’t see the elderly, pregnant or disabled person who just got on the train. Show some respect! I don’t care how into On the Road or Pride and Prejudice you are. We can all afford to be more aware of the people around us., This one’s for the ladies. Aren’t we just so lucky?!? Yes. I’m talking about that guy who sits on the platform and takes off his shoes and then asks to rub yours. But actually this is the worst ever, because obviously., I’m sorry to be pickin’ on 3rd Ave so much, but things with the rats on 3rd Ave are serious. In the two total times you’ll ever use this station to go shopping at Trader Joe’s, you’ll notice furry friends scuttling around, feasting on their lunch/ brunch/ tapas/ what have you via an open bag of Ruffles circa 2004. Well, New York is a city for everyone. I guess we all deserve fine cuisine… *Sigh.* Gross., The fact that there’s no express track keeps the L train held up for indefinitely anytime anything happens. Then you’re referred the *gasp* J train. Which brings me to my next point…., Seriously, even the flippin J train has an express. SMH., Do you know how cool the rest of Brooklyn is? Pretty friggin cool! In the cases you do go to check out an Italian joint on 4th Ave in Bay Ridge or for a walk in Prospect Park, have fun making a pit-stop in Manhattan for your transfer… unless of course, you’re willing for journeys on the G., Yes, this is a dismal prospect for any person in a borough other than Manhattan, as all boroughs are at some time serviced by the dreaded shuttle bus. But ride any shuttle bus on any other line, and feel like you’re on a Disney cruise compared to the L shuttle. That ish is by far the most angsty, overpopulated mess I’ve ever seen ever, and I swear you’ve never witnessed people more pissy at life than people on the shuttle bus. In the case of janky-weekend service,I just try to walk it out.,Well, that’s it folks! And after all that, I do want to say that the transit system in New York is incredible. It runs 24 hours a day, has no zones or peak fares. Even for all of these issues, we have a lot to be thankful for. But if you’re not ready to go back to riding the positivity train just yet (pun intended!), feel free to add your own L train woes in the comments so we can all commiserate with ya.","To me, life is meant to be classy-trashy.

We just got our hands on the debut issue of beautiful biannual ,, created in Brooklyn (largely in Bushwick). Issue #1 featured poetry by Eileen Myles, fiction by Jacob Mercer and visual art by Brett Rees, among others. On March 15, 2013, The Atlas Review opened their submissions process again in preparation for their issue #2. We took this opportunity and talk about the publication with its contributing editor ,., is a biannual print affair publishing essays, fiction, poetry, visual art and interviews. We stand by a unique editorial process that mingles anonymous submissions and solicited material. This enables us to: 1) afford a unique platform for new and/or under-known writers based solely on the quality of their work, and 2) provide a fresh dialog for established writers and artists. To put this in context, our first issue includes work by the legendary Eileen Myles, and an interview with George Saunders, alongside multiple pieces by first-time authors.,The magazine emerged from nothingness into everythingness when founders Natalie Eilbert and Jillian Kuzma longed for a space where readers and writers could escape the limits of prescribed communities. We think it’s working.,Our , handles the basics – word count, file format, etc. Beyond that, the answer is horribly vague: we want well crafted work that offers something new/vital. I can say that our conversations often circle around 1) the strength of individual sentence/line work, 2) compelling forms/structures employed beyond gimmickry, and 3) plots that develop quickly without devolving into familiar tropes. The best way to get a sense of what we’re looking for, though, is to simply grab up an issue from our site.,Ironically, the founders both have professional backgrounds producing e-books, but the choice to create a print journal is not merely a reaction to changing times. Rather, working with print affords us the chance to create a beautiful object, not just a reading experience. Our designer, Jay Demetillo, immaculately lays the pages out (you can get a sense of his work outside the magazine ,) and we’re proud to say the cover is one more example of an anonymous submission., ,Our event coordinator, poet Monica McClure, also runs the monthly Atlas Reading Series in conjunction with the magazine. It happens every second Wednesday at 61 Local in Brooklyn. The series is unique in that it pairs writers with visual artists. These artists (Chris Uphues, Bianca Stone, and many others) interpret the writing, and that interpretation is projected throughout the event. If you want to get a sense of what we’re about, it’s a great way to meet the editors and get a look at the magazine.

"Featured,People","Yes. Rebecca Goyette. If you haven’t seen her work, been jilted and dumbfounded by her refreshing take on being an artist in Bushwick, life, performance art and the ,—then you might be living inside of a seashell. I’ll let the words, the interview, and the motions speak for themselves…., We live in a world that’s in dire straits right now. Sometimes the last thing I want to see is dismal art. Do you think your performances bring a lot more humor into the art world, and where in particular does that come from within you?,Hmm, dismal art…it reminds me of John Baldessari’s piece made in 1971, where he wrote over and over again like a kid getting punished in school would have to write on the chalkboard: “I will not make any more boring art, I will not make any more boring art, I will not make any more boring art.”,To me, boring is dismal. However, I do not set out to make funny art - but by dealing with human sexuality, there is so much raw id and chance for physical comedy. I am usually motivated to explore an area of my mind, libido and preference that I do not understand or get at in real life., Do you believe that Bushwick will play an important role in performance art or act as a new Chelsea?,Well honestly, Bushwick is a great testing/proving ground for new ideas.  The DIY outposts of Bushwick are where many come to get juiced. There are some galleries in Bushwick that participate in the international art market, and some who play to a more local crowd. But in Bushwick, local cannot mean yokel, because of it’s proximity to Chelsea and the art market, so the work does get seen by a big cross section of folks.,The freedom to experiment can help fresh or more off-beat, less market-driven ideas to grow. This is very positive for art. Bushwick can also run the danger of being isolationist, situational or scene-based at times. I think it’s important that there be a fluidity between Bushwick and other areas where art thrives, be it in other parts of New York, or internationally. That’s where my mind is at, at least., Do you feel a sense of community here with other artists in Bushwick or do you generally think artists are islands unto themselves?,Artists are definitely not islands.  My support network of artists includes many in Bushwick, and from all over the place. My studio is in a small warehouse building in Bushwick, full of artists. This is where I have the chance to contemplate not only my own work, but those around me. I get to watch their work grow as well as my own. The proximity to artists I really respect and trust means so much to me., Do you see any differences between the performance art in New York vs the rest of the world?,I see differences in art around the world.  I was doing a project in Greece last summer, and got to know many artists there. There was a seriousness in their demeanor that’s different from New York. Culture definitely shapes us and our beliefs. That is totally fascinating to me.  We are products of our environment as well as unique individuals.,The video I made in Greece, Lobstapus/Lobstapussy will come out soon, and I think people will agree that the Greek men were a bit serious in the lobsta double-dick-speedos and lobsta-claws I provided them with to perform with me., What other artists living currently and from the past do you admire and learn from?,First of all, I learn most from artist friends and through all sorts of studio visits with curators, collectors, gallerists and with my performers and crew. And this is because of the direct connection we have in the present moment. But art history has other juicy lessons. My lobsta porn series draws a lot from surrealism with obvious connections to Salvador Dali. I also have gotten so much from , and his transgressive sensibility, and his use of sploshing, food and dramatic performance. I love thinking about ,, ,, , and , in connection with my practice, as well., If you had a kid and they told you they wanted to be a performance artist when they grow up, would you try to exorcise the demon?,Well why is that a choice between the two? Performance art is an excellent way to exorcise your demons! I just had a lobstapus (lobster/octopus combination) baby and he was born into performance, the cameras were on him from the start! And seriously, performance art’s popularity has to do with how we all “perform” in life to some extent.  Social media itself is so performative.,Also children need to be encouraged to become whatever type of person that they feel passionate about becoming. I was encouraged to be an artist by my parents, and for that I am grateful., You teach workshops in Performance Art at MOMA and I consider you to be one of the best and foremost experts in this medium. You’ve inspired me a lot. I’m curious though, have you seen many performance artists in Bushwick and what impression have they had on you?,Yes, I teach performance art as well as other forms of art-making at MoMA. It’s a wonderful privilege to share these ideas and methods with people in conjunction with viewing the museum collection and exhibitions. My view on art is so influenced by being immersed in this atmosphere. Through working there, I got a chance to meet ,, on of my heros. I was in the midst of preparations for a performance I was leading, which also involved 20 other performers, at ,, and I told her all about it. She passionately exclaimed, “Keep going!  Keep performing!  I salute you, artist does not just mean ‘painter who sits there all day staring at his canvas smoking a cigarette, drinking coffee!’”,I had to laugh, because I still have this weird inner-painter guilt, since I went to RISD for painting…even back then, I was creating performances and videos “on the side” while I struggled with painting. I am now much happier creating sculpture, video and performative works. So I actually have a similar chip on my shoulder as Marina. But I really love my painter friends and painting. I actually can’t help it. It’s in me.","Ana Lola Roman is an electronic musician, composer, singer, dancer, choreographer, occasional photographer and wanderlust.

Its owner, Dan Ross-Leutwyler, is a former chef of the now closed Bellwether in Williamsburg. Dan’s extensive cooking experience includes running the kitchen at Fatty Cue at Manhattan, as well helping to start things up at Roberta’s a couple of years ago. “We saw an opportunity to open a restaurant in a much smaller scale in Bushwick; also we felt an absence of this kind of a restaurant,” Dan told us. Although its name sounds like a German immigrant’s cafeteria, the food is very nouveau Brooklyn – soups, salads, a dash of Mediterranean, whole fish, pasta, all served in a friendly, forthright manner. Fritzl’s has a nice selection of wine and beer (only cans and bottles, no drafts unfortunately).,While I enjoyed a kale salad with black radish and tofu dressing ($7), neighbors popped in to take a menu and congratulate the new restaurant on opening. The Zombies played as I cut my crispy lamb, beet and yogurt sandwich($9.50). And after the whole black bass, flaky with a gingery touch of heat, I tried a cinnamony Oregonian vermouth to cleanse the palate. I followed that with the irresistible banana cream pie from Pies ‘n’ Thighs. The chef Dan is particularly proud of the Blood Sausage Tamale ($3), Hamburger ($8) and Pork Ragu Rigatonici ($11).

In the Hood,"The next key ingredient to the ,, and to getting more of what you want, is to expand. When you pour water into a cup, the cup will only hold the amount of water that equals the space available. The same principle holds true in how much you can receive. The key to expanding in the most desirable way is to make your “cup” bigger.,Expanding does not mean spacing out or checking out. It means becoming a bigger person with greater bandwidth and greater ability to receive what you want most in your life. Where is your cup so full that there is no room to hold any more? Expansion is about getting a bigger cup to make room for so much more. It’s also vital to review the contents of your relationships, your systems, your finances, your dreams, your work, your family, your hobbies, your self care, everything, and see what you perhaps want to pour out of your cup…this will help the expansion process. You are big enough to keep making space for it all, and you are also entitled to edit and choose exactly what you create space for. Every moment is a choice.,To Expand: Breathe deeply and feel into the container of your body. Give yourself 30 minutes of constructive inspiration time. Go do something that makes your inner child happy. Keep it simple. Take your inner artist on a date.,Then close your eyes and imagine. What you would like your life to feel like one year in the future? What does it feel like? Turn up the Technicolor on it and really feel into the details of what is happening in your vision. Float yourself into your own vision and see how it feels. Keep the feeling of your vision when you return, and when you are done, find one small thing you can do that replicates the feeling you have from your imagined memory of the future.

Despite the fact that many of the galleries were also participating in other events including ,, ,, , and ,, thirty galleries rallied to stay open past their normal business hours to welcome the swarms of visitors who participated in the gallery tour.,Because there is always too much good stuff to see, Katarina Hybenova and Allison Galgiani decided to divide and conquer, choosing some of their favorite shows of the night to share.,566 Johnson Ave.,Brooklyn, NY 11237,Brian Matthew: ,On view until March 31,In a more modest gallery, the large format multi-canvas compositions of , might have overwhelmed the viewer. However, The Active Space provides an ideal outlet for these massive compositions that demand enough space in which to view them. Each composition connects its disparate canvases together through the use of a singular color scheme—i.e. red, yellow and even grisaille—which in turn unifies them thematically in what first appears to be unassociated images. Matthew presents a burning tree, for example, next to a vintage image of nurses at work, and a shadowy depiction of a person descending a staircase below a cowboy herding cattle on a dusty plain. The lack of cohesion between the various images only adds to their intrigue, and allows the viewer to create his or her own connections between them. (AG),56 Bogart Street,Brooklyn, NY 11206,Sharon Lawless:,On view until March 17, singlehandedly overwhelms the gallery space at Robert Henry Gallery, seamlessly binding together her individual compositions into a unified installation. She refuses to let the edges of the museum board, on which these works are constructed, be the boundaries of a composition and instead draws and paints directly onto the white walls of the gallery space to physically connect her works. The installation works so well together that it is almost impossible to imagine a single disparate work existing without its neighbors. Referencing the cosmological tenants of ,, Lawless’s installation literally runs with the idea that new matter is continuously created as the universe expands, allowing her to create endless connections and links between existing matter in what could be an endless, neverending chain. (AG), ,66 Knickerbocker Ave,Brooklyn NY 11237,Rachel de Joode: ,On view until March 17, playful exploration of material properties typically associated with sculpture—volume, texture, scale and space—creates both a whimsical and unnerving exhibition. de Joode disrupts our assumptions that clay has a texture (by presenting it as a photograph) and that the base of a sculpture should possess volume (by printing it) causing the viewer to question his or her concepts of what constitutes matter. The pieces are particularly effective in Interstate Projects’ new location on Knickerbocker, with its uber-white walls and ample space. (AG), ,56 Bogart Street,Brooklyn, NY 11206,Kate Teale:,On View until April 7,‘s works, primarily graphite on paper, possess a wonderfully subdued quality that allows the viewer to practically be engulfed by the warm folds of her bed linens and sea swells, the subjects of the various compositions. Teale juxtaposes the concepts of intimate domestic space with the awesome natural power of water in her quiet, understated freeze-frame quality. It is nearly impossible to differentiate between domestic and environmental landscape, as both the creases of a bed sheet or mists of a waterfall meld into the same abstracted concept. In both instances, whether naturally occurring or manmade, Teale pushes the boundaries of what constitutes environment and causes the view to second-guess ideas of scale and power. (AG), ,253 Wilson Ave.,Brooklyn NY,Molly Costello & Mercedes Inez Martinez: ,On view until April 6, 2013,Chicago-based artists Molly Costello and Mercedes Inez Martinez drove from Chicago to Bushwick to create one of the best shows currently on view in the neighborhood.

In the Hood,"As an advice columnist, I often read other advice columns for inspiration. ,It’s from Slate.com; the advice columnist there is , or as she calls herself, Dear Prudence. To sum it up if you’re too lazy to go to the link, the letter is from a guy with a condition called  , which is a real condition. The guy with the condition is asking Prudence advice about how to “handle” (ha ha) his situation because every time he gets to where he wants to be, the chicks can’t handle it. They say shit like, “Aww, it’s so cute!” Prudence/Emily advises the guy to meet a woman on a website where he can be upfront about his, um, condition, so he’ll know that the woman is interested in him in spite of his shortcomings (ha! I’m on fire here!). I have to say, I give this guy a lot of credit for reaching out. He’s probably a very cool guy having to have dealt with all that and doesn’t take the ladies for granted.,I think Emily Prudence gave him pretty good advice. The one thing I would have added is something she didn’t address: how to meet and work with women in real life, not on the web. I would encourage him to get to know women who he feels he can trust; to make friends, if you will. He needs to take his time and, once he gets to know them, talk to them directly about his condition before he gets sexually involved with them. I mean, that’s great advice for anyone, under any circumstances, if you can swing it. One night stands are completely out for this guy, though. That’s just asking for trouble and setting him for more trauma when he becomes vulnerable to an unpredictable stranger.,Why do I bring this up? Sure, it makes for a rocking headline, but it also helps to educate all of us on sexual anomalies. This situation should give you some perspective on your own dating difficulties. Guess what? We all have our own brand of them. Even Taylor Swift. (Bullshit! That’s marketing.) You can also find photos of this condition on the web, but you’ll have to look that one up yourself., ,As I requested last week, someone sent in their art. Marty Gordon was the only person to do this! My self-esteem is in the dumper. Doesn’t anyone besides Marty want their art analyzed? Luckily Marty’s work is good stuff.,Judging from what I see of Marty’s work, it’s obvious he’s got a good sense of humor. He’s also got some issue with religion. I’m guessing he was brought up in a strict Catholic family and as he matured he began to see moral hypocrisy and disrespect for science in the church. I think this disappointed and hurt him. I’m also thinking he may be angry about feeling “tricked” as a child by the church and his parents into believing all this mishegas that turned out not to be true. What’s even more hurtful is that the authority figures in his life still believe in all of that morality bullshit. They think Cro-Magnon man walked the earth at the same time as humans, which we know is absolutely not true whatsoever.,I wonder how Marty’s sexuality was affected by his religious upbringing. (I know, I’m really going out on a limb here.) It seems to me that his work has a very self-consciously whitewashed sexuality. A sort of wholesomeness with a wink. I’ll bet Marty’s a romantic guy who still likes to keep a bit of mystery around sex, a private-type guy who is likely fun in the bedroom. I had a thought that he might be homosexual or even bi, since it’s hard to be sure about his sexual preferences from the photos and cartoon bubbles. Even the Marilyn Monroe chick has, for this type of thing, pretty small boobs, which is as far as I can tell a conscious choice to not show typical Kate Upton type boobs. There’s a certain kind of inhibition, I’d say. It could mean respect for women, ie: they’re more than just boobs. Or maybe Marty just feels awkward or indifferent to boobs.,What I appreciate most about Marty, through my perceived assessment of his work, is that he works out his hurt and disappointment about the church through his sense of humor, which is super healthy. Plus, he must have a balanced ego that allows him to maintain an emotional distance from the church and not take any of it personally. I’ll bet creating this work and balancing himself emotionally through it makes the rest of his life much nicer.,I sent this analysis to Marty, so I’ll let you know what I hear back.,Come to this! Friday night, March 15, an improv group, ARTPROV will be doing 6 scenes, each one inspired from a piece of my art work. I present a slide of my work and then they improvise a scene based on that.

And while we explore it, I know y’all are going to forgive my cheesy smile and otherwise ridiculous faces in these photos cause you know modeling in any capacity is hard, especially when you’re already an awkward human being who feels weird about life in general, and then on top of it my boyfriend took these photos of me at 9AM after an altercation with some dudes in a Frito-Lay shipment truck who thought hootin’ and hollerin’ was a good idea. So yeah, shit was real strange that morning, before yours truly even had her coffee. But enough with the disclaimers, yo. Let’s do this!,Alright ladies, springtime’s a-comin’.

Laaaamme.,It’s true. At this stage in life I won’t go anywhere near a sale at Rag&Bone or Marc by Marc Jacobs, even if it’s Marc by Mark-it-up by Marquee Jacobs for Target. No no no no no. I won’t even enter a hip lower-grade version of the high-class places that are directly marketed towards me like Urban Outfitters, H&M or Top Shop because a decent in vogue dress at those joints is still running some odd $60, which is way too much for something that’s not an amazing meal with the gals or savings towards a flight somewhere with palm trees. Y’all can keep your bourgeois names, diffusion lines & clearances to yourselves as long as Mandee, Strawberry and Expo 2000 are around, where the most expensive thing is, like, $29.99.,So, as proven by Emanuel Ungaro’s recent ,and Marie Claire mags all over every doctor’s office in Midtown, polka dots will soon (and always!) be our BFFs.

This shirt is also in season given its bright colors, and probably the only thing I’ve included in this post that can actually be worn to both work and a pre-Easter Brunch at Cafe Ghia or Mazelle.

But if that all sounds depressing and weird to you (and not just like my typical Tuesday night), AND you’re upset you’re not even gonna make it as far as Florida this year, y’all can at least compromise by taking a weekend trip to Atlantic city and rock this ish fabulously on the boardwalk.

Mind and Body,"It’s about 11 on a bright and cold Sunday morning. Instead of being cuddled up in my bed in Brooklyn after a boozy Saturday night, I’m in the Upper West Side. I’m out of breath and my adrenaline is pumping. I just finished (gently) poking and slapping women I’ve never met before – and vice versa – careful not to step outside of a red foam rectangle the size of a twin bed.,Sprinkled throughout the white walls are black and white vintage photos of a 40-year-old man, who looks like he’s on vacation with polyester pants, a polo and a fisherman’s hat, fighting off muggers. The phrase “Krav Maga. Saving lives since 1948,” is written above the entrance of the , center on West 100, Street. Tsahi Shemesh, IKM’s USA director and chief instructor, also has us run barefoot around the red and blue padded room. We leap, look and drop, and shoot back up to warm up before we get into the techniques. With about seven other women in yoga pants and painted toenails, I’m learning how to defend myself using the Israeli self-defense method.,Krav Maga, which means “contact combat” in Hebrew, is a noncompetitive self-defense technique based on natural human instinct and is the official self-defense and combat system of the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). The practice, created and continually developed by the Slovak-Israeli soldier Imi Lichtenfeld, combines martial arts, wrestling and boxing techniques for a no-rules combat and prevention system.,“Knowing Krav Maga means having the freedom to be who you are without being afraid,” Shemesh said.,What separates Krav Maga from other forms of self-defense and martial arts is that Krav Maga isn’t a belt system. It’s situation-based, meaning it will teach you to defend yourself in real threat situations, such as an attack from behind or a knife assault. It teaches you how to survive on the streets, where there are no rules, so kicks to the groin, pokes to the eye, or bites to an ear are all perfectly acceptable. The goal is survival.,The method also focuses on mastering the techniques, rather than the size and strength of a person, making it an ideal practice for smaller, weaker and older women, as well as men. Knowing Krav Maga could definitely come in handy in Bushwick where there have been a string of , since December 2012.,“In the real world, you’re not going to be carrying a belt,” Shemesh said. “Krav Maga teaches you to use your body and what you have to get out of a situation as quickly as possible.”,Claire Lacroix-Bouchardie, a 29-year-old French citizen now living in Manhattan for two years, ultimately decided to take Krav Maga classes at IKM after a fifth attack in Paris. The assault happened around 11AM on a Tuesday in the desolate financial district of Paris while she was with her colleague, an American “built like a football player.” The robbers quickly knocked him unconscious first with a surprise attack, and then pushed Lacroix-Bouchardie against the wall with her head down until she released her purse.,“The first four [assaults] I felt like a victim, like I was in an inferior position, but the fifth time I was angry. It had to stop because the next time I might end up in the hospital,” Lacroix-Bouchardie said. Although she feels safer in New York than in Paris, she still decided to take the classes.,“After four classes, I feel more confident because I feel empowered to do something,” she said.,Similarly, Lina Gonzalez, a 25-year-old Brooklyn resident, has been taking Krav Maga at the , in Tribeca for nearly a year and a half. Gonzalez, who now lives in Kensington, said she decided to take the classes because there were a string of muggings and shootings in her previous neighborhood of Lefferts Gardens.,“I no longer felt safe coming home at night – the threat of something happening felt very real to me,” she said. “Luckily, a friend who had taken Krav Maga had recommended it to me and after doing some research, it seemed to be the most effective, practical and quick form of self defense to learn.”,Patrick Lockton, Director of the Krav Maga Institute NYC in Tribeca, said Krav Maga teaches people to use common sense and objects they already have with them, like their voice, keys or handbags. It also teaches people to be aware of their surroundings.,“We teach a lot about distances and prevention. Rather than waiting to be attacked, if you can get away from a situation, it’s better than having to deal with one. Prevention is a really important part of what we do,” Lockton said.,A positive side effect of learning Krav Maga, Lockton added, is that his students not only feel confident in dangerous situations, but also in social situations.,“It depends how often you come in, but generally we can turn someone around from a complete novice to someone competent and confident to take care of themselves in six months,” Lockton said. “Even after two weeks of taking classes, people start to feel more confident.”,To learn more about Krav Maga for adult and kid courses please contact the following centers:, ",,"bushwick street safety,krav maga,self-defense","

And while you’re getting your spigarello fix, you can pick up some fresh/local/organic/non-genetically modified New York Yukon Gold Potatoes, Baby Spinach, Tangerines, Arugula, bread baked at Roberta’s, and Brooklyn brewed vegan cheeses.,But don’t panic, beef lovers! The co-op is not strictly a place for veggie-heads. You can also snag yourself some choice cuts of steak, juicy chickens, or grain fed turkey. If you’re looking for something mildly exotic, they’ve got duck and rabbit. And of course, all of the meats sold at the co-op are grass-fed, antibiotic- and hormone-free.,So how does it work? The cost of being a member is minimal – only 50 dollars – and you get to work at the co-op four hours a month, which means meeting new pals and chillin’ at ,. Members of the co-op enjoy steep discounts on a wide variety of meat and produce. At your average natural food store, expect a mark up of at least 60 – 100%, but at the co-op it’s only 24% for members. But let’s say you aren’t totally sold on easy, cheap access to locally grown organic groceries. No worries – even nonmembers can shop at the Bushwick Co-op, they just won’t enjoy the same super-low prices.,Currently, the Bushwick Food Co-op is open three evenings a week, but at the end of March they’ll be open on Saturdays, too. As the Co-op starts to grow (they hold new member orientations every other ,!), expect longer hours, a wider selection, and more food-oriented community events like cooking classes and bake-offs.,Skeptics amongst you may query: isn’t “eating local” just some hippie-dippie trend like ,? Well, while the environmental benefits of eating local are hotly ,, there is no question that eating more vegetables will reduce your carbon footprint, that ingesting fewer antibiotics will slow the rise of superbugs, and that sharing a new stellar recipe with your neighbor will be fun! And with a health conscious and food-knowledgeable staff, the Bushwick Food Co-op is the perfect place to go green.",Frances Gill is a scientist and a yoga fanatic.,"Bushwick,bushwick food co-op,healthy eating,organic food","

Arts and Culture,"Robert Moses was responsible for the displacement of hundreds of thousands of individuals, most notably and cruelly through the development of the Cross-Bronx Expressway. “When you operate in an overbuilt metropolis,” said the powerful city planner Robert Moses, “you have to hack your way with a meat ax.” This infamous quote came to symbolize the excess of a top-down approach to city development.,In 2005, after the City Council passed a rezoning ordinance, a neighborhood in Brooklyn 6 blocks wide and 17 blocks long became the site of a dramatic real estate boom. Developers were offered 25-year tax abatement to build condominiums. Thus begins , epic personal documentary charting the destruction/reconstruction of the neighborhood where she had lived for 20 years. Her film , opened this week at ,.,Filmed over a number of years, it’s a scathing portrait of one neighborhood’s demolition and transformation.,And capture it she does. The film begins with the filmmaker climbing a flight of stairs, opening a heavy steel door and walking into a vast, but now vacant, floor with gorgeous historic vaulted ceilings. Where she had lived, where she had celebrated her life for the past 20 years. It was where her partner, the painter Cathy Nan Quinlan, started The ‘temporary Museum of Painting (and Drawing), which championed the local art scene. The floor had been completely gutted. Her first words in the film are:,“Oh…Oh my god…they took everything down! Oh, there’s birds!…When we first came here, pigeons lived in here.”,The film is chock full of clips featuring the resident community. There is an elderly lady with her pushcart, another resident working in a garden near the Russian Orthodox Cathedral of the Transfiguration of Our Lord. They seemingly face off with the new, mostly white, affluent condo dwellers. Friedrich finds herself confronting them as she carries her camera to document new development after new development. “I’m allowed to film because you’re on public space,” she insists to one spritely, well-heeled gal who snarls at her for filming. The gal fumbles with her hands full with trendy shopping bags. Soon Friedrich films the infestation of small fancy dogs and sleek granite kitchen counters featured at the condo openings she attends. The entire audience cracks a smile when one realtor after another comments on the use of subway tiles as fashionable accessory.,The film’s genius is in the way Friedrich charts and counts the demolition of the old and the construction of the new. She charts each new development while marking it in red on a map. The rising number of new condos – 60, 61, 62, 63 – underscores that fact that eventually she too will be displaced. And she is. But it’s not without a hilarious scene of her heckling real estate brokers wandering her street below from her window, “Welcome to the neighborhood. You’re ruining it!”,Around 2007/2008, when feelings were running really high, anti-building graffiti began to appear on the fencing around new developments. Across the street from her loft, where an industrial building had been demolished, Friedrich tagged the construction fence with one of her own that reads: ARTISTS USED TO LIVE HERE,Much of the justification for demolishing was based on developers claims that there was no longer any industry left in Williamsburg. Friedrich’s film does a good job dispelling this notion as she walks in and out over the course of the film in an attempt to document thriving businesses hard at work. We grow fond of these businesses and when their buildings are sold out from under them some, like Friedrich’s local mechanic, are given a month to clear out. She films the local butcher vacating the storefront he had occupied for 38 years. We grow particularly fond of the Forklift Repair Shop located directly across the street from Friedrich and Quinlan’s loft. “Hey Cathy! There it goes!” she yells as the mighty backhoe pulls down the last of the remaining façade.,There is some poetic justice in the fact that it takes a team of construction workers nearly two weeks to remove a huge boulder from the foundation of the Forklift building. Friedrich films the crew struggling to break it up. All hope seems to be placed in the rock’s fate. But it too succumbs to the sweeping change of the neighborhood.,After number 173, Friedrich gives up counting and mapping new resident towers. Where there were once thriving industries, working-class families, and artists, there now stand luxury condos. As the credits roll, Friedrich offers up comments left on Curbed.com, a site devoted to real estate. When Friedrich’s graffiti tag appeared on the site it spawned a slew of anti-artist comments. Here is Friedrich’s favorite:,The last “artist” we had was Picasso. The rest of them should just eat shit and move on.,FYI: ,, reports that last month Bushwick’s residential rent prices leaped by 20 percent. Hey Su can I borrow that camera? Gut Renovation: Bushwick Edition begins now.,, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village. Written, directed and edited by Su Friedrich; director of photography, Ms. Friedrich; writing and editing consultant, Cathy Quinlan; released by Outcast Films. Running time: 1 hour 21 minutes. This film is not rated.,Additional information about the filmmaker:,

We went to another body painting party at ,; this shindig was called “Abstract” and was hosted by ,, who put on a lot of shows around the area and in Manhattan. What greeted us was a warehouse full of gyrating glow-in-the-dark body parts and bumping house music that pulsed your organs worse than a Motorhead concert.

People,"A couple of weeks ago a remarkable photography exhibition by , opened at ,. The magical photographs of Chrisostomou may appear heavily Photoshopped but, in fact, the only thing manipulated here is your assumptions.,Chrisostomou photographs ordinary, everyday objects. He photographs them in familiar and unremarkable environments but the notion of scale is disrupted to such a degree that the work becomes surreal. A viewer, jaded by the digitally altered imagery of today, can easily forget how painstaking creations such as these can still prevail. The pleasure in Chrisostomou’s photographs becomes the search for imperfection – the identification of a human creator.,We met Petros in his studio on Bogart Street to talk about how he achieves a strikingly contemporary aesthetic using an almost-antiquated practice., I know from your website that you went to art school in England. What did you study?, I went to St. Martins College where I studied sculpture., Did you seriously study sculpture at St. Martin’s College?, , Yep., Did you have a thirst for knowledge?, , Are we both singing Pulp in our heads?, , Yes! I wasn’t expecting you to say sculpture. Let’s start with that. How has sculpture influenced your photography?, I was really influenced by Richard Serra and Jessica Stockholder. They make these huge freestanding structures. Beautiful pieces. I wanted to make that sort of work but I could never store it. I realized that only through photography could my sculpture work have any permanence. When I needed a space for my sculptures, I decided to build it., , You built your own exhibition space?, Yeah, the miniatures. That’s when I started building miniature sets., Oh my goodness! Okay, I see what you’re saying. Yes, you still are a sculptor. I mean, you’re a photographer, too. But that is sort of secondary to all this, isn’t it?, I build this thing, which is the artwork. Then, I photograph it and , becomes the artwork. It asks new questions in this new form. Which part of this piece is the artwork: the sculpture or the documentation of the sculpture? What remains is the idea of the artwork, not the artwork as it was originally. I enjoy that., Like Christo’s wrapped landscapes?, Yeah. There are countless examples. I agree with Boudrillard’s idea that the simulacrum is not [an inferior] copy of the real, but its own truth. I guess I try to explore these ideas with my work., What happens to the sets once they have been photographed?, The photograph is the end product. I think as an artist you want to control the way the viewer sees the work. In the end the sets are pulled apart. I hang on to bits if I think I can re-use or re-fashion them, but the set disappears., I am just amazed at what you’ve built. They are very detailed architectural models. How long do they take to make?, It depends. These are all at various stages of completion. I could spend a whole day looking for bits and pieces and come back with nothing and that’s a very disappointing day. Sometimes a project can’t continue because of a delay in the process, like if I can’t find a specific piece or can’t make it myself. It can take up to six months to build a set for all those reasons. Moving studio spaces always sets me back as well. Everything has to be disassembled and packed into boxes; it’s a nightmare., I am just so excited by all this. It’s so tactile and playful. These tiny little washing machines! Where do you get all this stuff?, Some things I buy, some things I find and appropriate, and some things I have fabricated. For example, if I go to a doll store they will never have the sort of grimy office furniture I need. But I might go there and be able to appropriate something., , I love the idea of a grown man rummaging around a doll store all day., Oh please. They know me by name. There’s only one in Manhattan, on 77th and 3rd so they know me by now. I know a lot of these things are online, but I want to be able to see things in person to get a sense of color and size., How much is Photoshopped?, None of it. It is traditional photography. Somehow we think we are seeing this fantastical, impossible space. But it’s all there. People have been doing this still life tradition for centuries.  It’s crazy to build all these things; it’s crazy and obsessive. But that gives it meaning. It’s poetic and beautiful. When we live in an age where things are so superficial and artificial it’s even more important to make work this way., Let’s talk about the photography process for a little bit. You have this beautiful large format camera. When did you learn your camera craft?, , I taught myself. I think I’m a terrible photographer. I always use available light, and sometimes I shoot five or six frames just to get the one that I’m happy with. I probably shouldn’t admit that on record., , I think you’re doing okay with five or six to one. Why large format?, It has to do with the size of the images. I always wanted really big prints. I wanted them large enough so that the viewer feels like they are walking into them, but still small enough to feel it as an artwork. I was shooting on 35mm film early on and I had them printed at nearly six feet long, but they were really grainy. I didn’t mind – there is a certain beauty in that – but people started recommending that I focus more on image quality, so I did., What is your routine? What does your work week look like?, My mornings are spent checking my inbox. Time zone differences make things difficult. I work with a gallery in Athens, so they are seven hours behind. I end up working a lot in the evenings and on the weekends. I wish I didn’t have to spend so much time online, but that’s the way it is. Sourcing things is so time-consuming. Communication is a killer, too. Sourcing and quotes, material approval, printing details, all the administration involved is all so time-consuming. But I guess you learn every single aspect of the art world when you have to do it all yourself., Do you enjoy living and working in Bushwick?, I moved to Bushwick two years ago and started to feel comfortable right away. It’s great here. Now that Fuchs has this space I feel like part of a gang. We go to openings together. It’s really made me feel part of something. I was a Greek Cypriot in London, so I feel like I’ve never really had a “clique.” The greatest thing about Bushwick is that people have come here from all over the place., Do you go out in Bushwick?, I would, but I don’t think I’m cool enough. , I like Wreck Room. For me, that place is everything that this neighborhood represents. The Anchored Inn is kind of nice as well., I don’t know the Anchored Inn…, Well we’ll just have to go there some time., Immediately, please, if not sooner!,***,Keep your eye out for interesting things brewing at ,.

The Locally Grown performers were chosen because of their ability to craft decisions and show the audience something they want to see, even if they don’t know it yet. These purposeful choices lead to playing with elements that are atypical for a drag show, such as virtuosic dance, video projection and fake blood. “They are making a statement instead of embodying Beyoncé” says DiBa. This statement equals a show where NOTHING is off limits.,Locally Grown is not your average dress-wearing, ballad-lip synching, transformation to Hell’s Kitchen bingo night. No. These performers are extravagant and mean to be. They are purposefully weird, awkwardly comedic, outlandish and vulgar. All the cool verbs.

Arts and Culture,"‘s madness of an art studio is the exact antithesis of Jason Andrew’s spotless apartment gallery, ,. When visiting him in September of 2012, he told me about being a kid in the midwest and going to all-night coffee shops. There, he and his friends would get hopped up on coffee and buy jelly doughnuts. They’d take the doughnuts to Kinko’s and smear them across the copy machine’s glass to match the speed of the machine’s light. Upon paying for the copies the late night clerk would give them a sly smile – aware of the hijinks they’d wrought and the clean up ahead of him.,That clerk’s intuition for letting these kids play with color has panned out to be a wise one. If only because Ben has followed this direction into the three-dimensional realm with his fantastical sculptures. Sculptures that have dotted the landscape outside Norte Maar in Beat Nite’s and BOS’s past. Recently, he’s revisited the photocopy work by publishing with ,. These series of events led ultimately to the exhibition ,at Norte Maar.,The sculpture , is a 5′ by 5′ by 5′ three-part freestanding behemoth. A behemoth completed in just three weeks. Splashes and lines of a painterly quality are held in by glass on the outermost sides. During the opening, Godward encouraged people to stick their heads inside the gaps in the sculpture to see what he had really done. By my estimate, he has taken his natural tendency to layer, build, coat and enlarge his eye-candy sculptures and whipped them into a sleek and modernist form.,In the kitchen and office area are pieces unlike what we’ve grown accustomed to seeing from the artist. A Mountain Dew can painted and speckled with nail polish sat inside a glass case on a perfectly white shelf. Its title: ,. On the adjacent wall, one of the Fortress To Solitude prints hung of the same can, simply titled ,. This unassuming bit of curation gives a view of the creative process involved in the non-Photoshop assisted prints.,Finally, in the office we encounter more experiments in nail polish.

Food and Drink,"A little further out and a quick hop to the JMZ line, and the available nightlife starts to expand beyond the typical Brooklyn dive bars. Yes, this part of Bushwick has dive bars aplenty, but there are also dance clubs, concert venues, and refined cocktail bars serving locally sourced grub. Bottom line: you can satisfy pretty much any type of nightlife craving within a five block radius.,Paying homage to the legendary Warhol-approved Greenwich Village café of the same name, , strives to capture a similar artist-friendly vibe, providing both a performance space for musicians, artists, and burlesque dancers and some serious cocktails for serious imbibers. The slightly eerie, offbeat vibe is played up by red lights that cast an unnatural glow into otherwise dark spaces, creepy day-of-the-dead dolls smiling down (or up) from their window perches, and Gothic lamps providing little in the way of illumination and a lot in the way of weird shadows. A full bar ensures your alcohol quota is taken care of, plus there’s a selection of French wine (courtesy of the two French owners) and international beers, including Left Hand Milk Stout ($6). Specialty cocktails are a bit pricey at $13, but with names like the espresso-and-tequila-based Johnny Mad Dog and a heavy pour, they’re well worth it., Lose all your inhibition with an absinthe cocktail like the No. 4, a heady mix of Saint Germain, Pernod, absinthe, grapefruit and champagne ($13).,Another under-the-tracks bar slash restaurant, this warm little spot offers simple yet delicious cocktails and a menu of locally sourced eats, including salads of the day ($9) and bread from Robertas ($1). To create a warm, homey vibe, the décor combines rough wood accents, large chalkboard menus, and stylishly distressed wooden countertops and tables, plus small vases of flowers to provide bursts of color in an otherwise monotone design palette. Formerly Beauty Bar and after that (albeit briefly) Broomies, the owners renovated and gutted the space before launching ,, previously a long-time Smorgasburg booth. Simplicity is still key, with a cocktail list of basics like margaritas and Bloody Mary’s for just $7, or drafts like Empire Amber Ale, 21, Amendment Back in Black, and Dundee Brown Lager for $6., The Late Night Reviver ($9), a mix of gin, Fernet, fresh ginger and lime.,With the latest underground DJs manning the deck and a kickass sound, this tropical-themed dance club has quickly become the spot where young (and not-so-young) Bushwickians shake and shimmy out their weeklong frustrations on the dance floor. A wilder alternative to the standard Bushwick bar scene, ,’s off-the-beaten-path vibe belays the 1960s Miami dance club vibe and energy pulsing out as soon as you walk in the door. Revelers can get down to a mix of house and techno music while sipping on $9 tropical cocktails and $6 thirst-quenching beers. Plan on putting on your dancing shoes for the wild parties on Friday and Saturday nights, and don’t worry about the dress code or cover…there is none. Cash only., Stay hydrated with a $2 cucumber juice or a $6 Pacifico.,This dark little dive bar nestled under the JMZ tracks has everything a good bar needs, from a pinball machine to heavily tattooed bartenders to regularly scheduled burlesque shows. Stylishly lit with candles, its relaxed vibe is enhanced by low-key wood benches dotting the space and a curved bartop at which you’ll find all sorts of people, from a manic-pixie-dream-girl folding origami to a 50-something local looking to take in the new neighborhood nightlife. Like its neighbor Goodbye Blue Monday, ,offers semi-frequent concerts but with a drink list as unpretentious as the illuminated wolf lighting a sign outside the bar, offering thirsty patrons beer, wine, and hard liquor.

Arts and Culture,"Last Saturday night, we visited a new gallery at 17-17 Troutman called , The exhibition, titled ,showcased the work of ,and,, both highlighting the similarities of the artists and juxtaposing them to create a visually compelling dialogue. These layered interactions colored the walls of the literal and figurative white space in Ridgewood, manifesting a well-received exhibition.,The two artists worked in a limbo between the actual and the desired space; between reality and memory, presence and absence. This in-between movement in the themes of both artists created a movement in the exhibition itself. Their work complemented and defined the distance between each other’s work.,Cassie Raihl’s work was composed of five sculptures. Her material-heavy abstraction, as she defined the exhibited works, was focused on physical labor and fetish. As she walked me through her works she pointed out the various materials used; from boxer shorts to cushions and T-shirts, these materials celebrate the absent body. Her white-centered work was mixed with colorful additions of commercial textures.,Whereas Cassie was using found objects, the commercial aspect was manifested through found colors from J. Crew catalogs arranged with colors found in 16th century Iranian documents in JJ’s paintings. Being a keen observer of his world, as he told us, he accesses his curiosity for color and there he finds inspiration. He also becomes an observer of his work during the process and builds on the idea that brought the painting into life. By becoming the viewer and the artist at the same time, parts of his work explain and give away parts of the process.,As we talked with ,, whose work was shown before, she pointed out how the works of the two artists complimented each other spatially and visually, creating a natural fit based on the use of current subjects with commercial aesthetic. We also talked about the effect a gallery like Harbor has on the artistic community of Bushwick. According to Magali, the gallery is part of a larger equation that brings new artists together and, by opening their space for emerging artists to show their work, they become part of a broader network of people.,The 17-17 Troutman building, the home of several DIY galleries organized by artist collectives, was filled with people last Saturday. People moved around the galleries, viewed new works of art, supported the cultural production of an area and captured a moment in time of a neighborhood that finds inspiration in people coming together, exchanging ideas and, through their co-existence, creating something new., ",An explorer of sorts.

Fashion & Shopping,"Spring is around the corner, and if that isn’t enough to make you excited to get outside again then learning about a new custom bicycle studio in Bushwick should. AJ Nichols opened , last September and has been providing the neighborhood with awesome custom-made bikes ever since.,One wouldn’t think to look for a bicycle studio in a basement, but customers soon forget they’re underground when they see the studio for the first time. Zeppelin playing in the background, a Brooklyn lager in hand and conversation that feels like you’re talking to an old friend can make anyone feel right at home.,Nichols knows his bikes. He’s been restoring, repairing and transforming them into impeccable works of art since he was 16. As a first-time business owner, he’s excited to get his shop off the ground.,“Buying a bike in New York on Craigslist is kind of a gauntlet,” Nichols explains. His studio cuts out the middleman and gives people a more personal experience when it comes to choosing the perfect bike for them. When he’s not teaching bike mechanics at ,, Nichols is in his shop fixing up antique and vintage bikes or searching for his next big find.,“I’ve streamlined the whole process,” he says. “I buy the bikes out of state, tear them down and turn old 70s and 80s ten speeds into affordable road bikes.” Nichols provides a ride for the average customer looking to get around town, but he also specializes in restoring pre-war antiques, ’60s muscle bikes and ’50s Schwinn’s for collectors.,Most of the bikes turned into commuters are from out of state, but Nichols works with clients who have custom orders or are looking to trade in their old bike for something new. “That’s how it all started because I knew there was a demand for affordable, high-quality bikes,” he says. “People want something they can lock outside for a few hours and it’s not a thief magnet.”,As for the collectibles, he meticulously strips them of the current paint job to expose the original patina. A few antiques are from the pre-war era and would look amazing in anyone’s home or rolling down the street.,Customers who stop by can’t help but notice the antiques, and a penny-farthing from the 1800s sticks out as it sits against a wall. “Everything was made by hand by a blacksmith so there aren’t any replacement parts,” Nichols says about his crazy find. “If it takes years to restore and sell and I have to look at it everyday I’m ok with that.”,Nichols works hard to ensure that his clients leave with a bike that fits them and their needs, and also offers general repairs and tune-ups. “Bike shops don’t do old school service options anymore and that’s horrible,” he says. “I have a lot of pride in knowing I can take a bike out of the trash and make it awesome.”,Nichols has big plans for his studio and hopes to expand in the future. A nostalgic-feeling retail space filled with vintage bikes and a top-notch service station is a lofty goal, but may not be as far away as he thinks.,“It’s a simple concept to try and sell quality stuff that was made to last,” he says. “If it’s been around for twenty or thirty years and it’s still rolling, it’s going to last another twenty or thirty.”","Native Texan, writer and aspiring rock star.

Arts and Culture,"Place 60 artists and hackers over a strong God-inspired fire. Boil frantically for 72 hours. Serve in party mode for only one night in 27 distinct servings. The second iteration of , in Bushwick took place last Saturday at , and looked like a recipe made for the modern technological age.,This year’s theme, “God Mode,” has been an interesting feature in video games since the 1980s, but has also recently migrated to our ever-expanding digital lives. In the gaming world, God Mode grants players unlimited strength, seconds of invulnerability or access to previously unreachable areas; in everyday life, God Mode is materialized in the constant surveillance of our electronic devices.,By exploring this theme, the projects created an experience that resembled an acid trip of flashy imagined worlds, dystopian futures and religious omnipotence all at once. Projects were simultaneously funny and grotesque, poignant yet playful.,In the basement, one of the projects taught us how to avoid DNA collection by the authorities, inspired by Gataca. Though low on technological complexity, it gave us a glimpse of a world where science fiction is becoming reality.,On the other side of the basement, the creators of , allowed people to digitally create or destroy land, inspired by,. A simple concept, yet technically complex, the project will have the potential to evolve outside of Art Hack Day.,On one of the walls on the main floor, there was a computer installation that offered people a chance to explore and surf the web in the company of Jesus. , was a simple idea that let the user make what s/he wanted of it, even if that meant watching gay porn, for example. In whatever way s/he chose to use it, Jesus was acting like a hacker intercepting the information.,A gaming app called , involved a designated God/user and his subjects that provided him/her with their video feeds. As the different devices were connected, points were accumulated, towards talking to God or achieving Godhood. The creators of the app are planning on getting the app to the iTunes store, bringing us closer to their version of the gamified Big Brother.,As I left the this modern-day technological circus, I could see why this event takes place in Bushwick. The face of this neighborhood is formed by the technological advances that are happening around us. Automation and robotics have rendered traditional manufacturing obsolete, leaving us with giant warehouses and buildings that now host artists, programmers, engineers and designers who further our thinking and approach to an obscure future, where technology will be omnipresent in every move we make.,For an extended view of the projects, check out the , on the Art Hack Day website and make sure to check out the , space for more interesting events in the future., ",An explorer of sorts.

In the Hood,"One of the skills I’ve developed as a self-proclaimed psychotherapist is analyzing people’s personalities by studying their artwork. I think that this is a great way to gain insight because so much of the unconscious mind is expressed through art. (,.)

Artists in the video are ,and ,., ,Last week I was at a Bushwick Open Studios meeting at Brooklyn Fireproof and an interesting exhibition by , caught my eye. Pardon the pun. Margot’s work was portraits of strangers that she took and painted with cascading eyeballs. They were wonderful paintings and indicated some sort of obsession not only with the eyeballs, but with a large quantity of paintings. So between , and studying her paintings I came up with this assessment:,Another artist whose work has a very different psychological voice is ,. The nature of her work is directly sexual and attention grabbing. Rebecca’s work seems to use lobsters as a metaphor for human sexuality. She writes in her artist’s statement, “Performance, sculpture, sound, and image come together in the form of video.” She also uses only untrained performers dressed in her sculptural sexy lobster costumes in her videos. Here’s my psychological take on Rebecca’s work:,What’s great about these two artists is you can see how creating art is helping them develop as people. Art is a great way to exorcize your demons. I think that’s a significant reason why people feel inspired by viewing art; you can sense the quality of human development baked into the work.","Dr. Lisa, S.P., is a self-proclaimed psychotherapist, artist, performer and comedian.

Their sound is hard to define, even when their songs are slowly being unwound before an audience. Their music is characterized by layers of breathy, jazzy vocals that quiver in heartfelt harmonies and cascading rounds. These heavenly coos ring atop succinct psychedelic guitar reverb and spacey synthesizer riffs, lead by captivating and powerful drums, arrive at the point of awesome.,The point, in this case, is pleasantly confusing. Sometimes it’s an eruptingly loud climax, other times it’s the softest whimper of a guitar, calm vocals and scattered muted beats. While you drift back and forth, you’ll be overcome with the variety of influences that stretch each song - jazz, pop, experimental, funk, rock. Switching your body’s rhythm to adapt to a nostalgic atmospheric intro that will soon transform into jazzy and hypnotizing interlude (“Hold Your Tongue”), you’ll realize there’s a lot more to this band than the Brooklyn Indie title they’ve started to earn. No wonder they list ,, ,, and ,as influences on their ,.,There’s definitely something satisfying about not knowing where a band’s sound will take you. Too often, debut albums wind in a circle that seems enticing at first but never takes off beyond a few jangy chords. The opposite applies for this album, which I’ve been streaming from Bandcamp since it debuted. I’m always pleasantly surprised by the twists of each song flowing together and transitioning. The unexpected roaring guitar solos towards the end of “3,4,5 (I lost)”, rapid-fire cymbals and almost drone tendencies drift into the hymn-like chanting of vocals coated in thick soul on “Nonah,” which brings to mind both the vocal power of both , and ,. Then the next song, “Ere,”  mingles repetitive tribal beats with shrieky, emotive vocals that resemble the screeches of Montreal’s ,.

Arts and Culture,"Bushwick residents seem hip to the idea of making art for the community. Festivals like , provide audiences with a peek inside the studio doors of local artists. But what about people living in Bushwick day in and day out? What do they see? The sidewalks, buildings and street fashion can be enough stimulation in and of itself, but why is Bushwick being compared to Manhattan gallery communities? After attending the opening for “Spun O Lith” at , on Friday night, I find myself asking whether or not Bushwick artists make art specifically for Bushwick artists.,Rebecca Gaffney, lead curator for ,, is a Brooklyn-based video and installation artist who works with out-of-phase strobe light and reflections of performers in live camera feedback. She likes to improvise with light, music and sound. And Spun O Lith was just that – the improvising of visual materials within a space.,But what does that improvisation do for the viewer? Do we hope for something magical to happen? Do we stare at the machinery long and hard until what we think is important, happens? Through a tangled web of video projections and a system of mirrors, the Spun O Lith viewer is immediately stimulated with reflective materials – all supposedly found on the streets of Brooklyn, also referred to as “covert trash operations.” Channels of video feedback manipulate what you see. It’s a slow manipulation and you have to linger in the space to notice it. You may experience your refracted self, but never a refraction of reality.,It was evident that Gaffney could lure a crowd. Bushwickers swayed late into the evening, grinding to digital soundscapes and nursing drinks while wearing sunglasses – but the latter was part of the exhibition experience. Pick up a mirror and play. Darken your environment with shade.,The space definitely seemed to be curated for a Bushwick crowd; it had a messy-cool feel to it. The foil on the walls hung sloppily, wires weaved in and out of the floor, a bit ominous for someone holding a drink. But, Spun O Lith showcased found objects that YOU could have touched; work in progress ideas that were evolving in real-time, which presented the opportunity for the audience to connect to the live process. The trashy layout seemed purposeful, maybe , was the point.,When I asked Gaffney about her inspiration, she mentioned “the wasteland.” Approaching her latest collaborative project with “easy instinct,” Gaffney is open to whatever comes in her path. She lists her favorite contemporary artists as the people she’s working with right now, “light channelers and demon blockers.”,Here’s a video with Spun O Lith collaborator, Matthew Caron.,Ultimately, Gaffney wants viewers to get “high on light” when roaming through the condensed space. Try to allow yourself to flow with the changing exhibition, and if you’re having difficulty with that, try putting on some sunglasses. Maybe bring a few glow sticks of your own, as well.,Spun O Lith will be open at Fitness Center for Arts and Tactics until March 15, and will feature a changing variety of video artists and musicians.",I am interested in immersive experiences of all kinds.

"Featured,In the Hood","As is the nature of New York (and something we will ALWAYS be discussing), the rising rents in the once affordable neighborhoods are pushing New York newbies further out on subway lines. People are even going past *gasp* the Jefferson Street L station. OMG!!!!!,Yes, the rumors are true. As Craigslist annoyingly proves day after day, recently graduated students and transplants who are just kicking off their careers must now move as far as ,. But just how cool is life that far out on the line? Is it worth living in the boonies just to be off the L train and close to places like Morgan Ave where there are Yelp acclaimed bars and Zagat rated restaurants? Here’s an idea. Let’s find out!, ,For those who have never made the trip, the L train Halsey stop is literally right on the border of Bushwick, Brooklyn and Ridgewood, Queens. These two neighborhoods paint a very different picture, as Queens is known to give you way more bang for your buck nowadays than Brooklyn or Manhattan a.k.a. the mothership of exhorbitence and ridiculousness. According to ,, the average rent for a three bedroom in Ridgewood is $1751, as opposed to hotspot Morgan Ave area where it’s $2,792. What da funk. No wonder mofos are searching for dwellings in other seas.,Ridgewood is about the same on the crime scale as Bushwick. So far in 2013, , precinct has had 221 crime complaints for felonies, as opposed to , which has had 226, including two murders. But there has been one more reported rape in Ridgewood than Bushwick which, if you’re like me, is what you , care about. However, in other sex crimes, Bushwick outweighs Ridgewood 9 to 2 which is terrifying. But there’s many more burglaries in Ridgewood than Bushwick. So whether you feel safe or unsafe off Jefferson and DeKalb, you’ll likely feel the same off Halsey.,
But let’s not focus on these stats. They’re just the crime numbers, people. And while it’s ,important to know this stuff, nobody wants to talk about depressing things all day. AMIRITE?? We also want to know how it actually feels to live off Halsey. What are the apartments like? Where do the residents eat and hang out? WHY LIVE LIFE ON THE EDGE??? (And by that, I mean the Brooklyn-Queens edge).,Richard P. of Covert Street originally moved to Washington Heights two years ago. As a musician, Richard found himself having public transit escapades from upper Manhattan to Brooklyn because all the venues he wanted to visit are in the ‘Wick or the ‘Burg. Think about it. The L train is simply strung with hot concert spots like , and or , that used to be a storage facility. “Even though I was living [in Washington Heights], I wasn’t really hanging out in Manhattan. It’s a deadzone. There’s nothing for me, musically. My catch phrase actually is ‘Maybe Manhattan.’” (We both had a chuckle at that one. You gotta hand it to him. You really do).,When Richard first made the switch to north Brooklyn, he was living off the Montrose stop on the L, but then moved to Halsey for cheaper rent. Right now he’s only paying $500 for one bedroom in a two bedroom apartment. “Yeah it’s further, but there’s no downside really. If you’re expecting something glamorous, Halsey will let you down. But if you want something cheap, you have to make concessions.” While he says there’s nowhere really to go right off his stop in terms of bars, cafes and restaurants, he knows a lot of other people on Halsey, so for fun he’ll usually hang out at a friend’s place. “Other than that there’s really nothing to do. Even bodegas close by 10 p.m. Like I said, it’s not glamorous.”,Theresa D. of Hancock is quite content with Halsey. She has a three bedroom apartment where she also has an amazing redone backyard and entire basement to use as a practice space for her band. “I like that it’s a real neighborhood, not a summer camp like other areas off the L, like Morgan. The nightlife is a bit dry, but if we want to go out, we usually take the B60 to Morgan or Jefferson Street, and it’s only a 5 minute ride.” Theresa expressed that being close to her friends was a huge factor in deciding where to live, and most of her friends live off the L. She’s also able to feel like she can have an actual home in her current situation, which is in a brownstone, as opposed to 532 Johnson where she used to live, and said felt very temporary and a bit janky. I asked Theresa if she felt safer off Halsey versus 532 Johnson which is situated in a very desolate, industrial area. “532 Johnson was a bit weird because it’s desolate and near the DOE fund. Halsey is quiet in winter, but in the summer there’s a lot of parties and then a lot of cat-calling. But that can happen anywhere, and it’s a very family oriented neighborhood, so I guess it all depends.”,Santiago M. has been living off the Ridgewood side of Halsey for almost a year and feels very safe. He comes from a small town in New Mexico, so the residential feel of Ridgewood is actually comforting to him. “I can go home and feel relaxed. Bushwick is a little more rowdy than Ridgewood.” Santiago said that the selling point was definitely being off the L train. “I live close to the L and it’s a mainline, straight to the city.” As someone who works in film, Santiago finds himself all over New York for work, so the easy transfers on 14th Street make for a nice commute. While Santiago says there’s not much to do in general, there is a cool gallery called , in his neighborhood. “There’s not much else in terms of boutique places, but for general food it has everything you need. I can see more things opening up in the future though.”,Belen L, formerly of Summerfield Street, saw no upsides though. “I moved there because it was cheap. I thought it wasn’t that far, but didn’t realize how bad an extra four stops can be, especially when there’s nothing around you. There’s no bars, no cafes, nowhere to go. Every time I wanted to go somewhere I had to leave. And when you live in Ridgewood, none of your friends want to come visit you. There’s also smelly places where they have live chickens and bunnies you can butcher yourself. It stinks. And there’s no good grocery stores aside from a grubby Western Beef.” When I asked her if she ever hung out there while living there, she said, “No. Not once.” When I asked if she saw any benefit to living there, she said, “If you’re looking to have family and a boring place close to fun places, sure. Well, semi-close, anyway.”,So what we’ve gathered is, yes, Halsey means extra time on the train and, yes, it can be a little boring and not necessarily safer. But if you’re a north Brooklyn lover who needs an affordable pad in a real neighborhood with actual families and schools and stuff (and you have a good playlist for your commute), Halsey could be right for you. Think about that brownstone you’ve always wanted to sit on the stoop of during the summer like in ,. You can actually have it in Ridgewood. And if Williamsburg is your farthest destination most of the time, things are still close. Well, semi-close. But even if you don’t plan on moving there, visit your friends who do. You could be hanging out in an awesome backyard like Theresa’s or getting to know people at the surrounding lofts like Richard does. And if you’re not going to even do that, at least consider investing in a place for when Halsey’s first bourgeois-dega opens up and the area is worth a flippin’ goldmine.","To me, life is meant to be classy-trashy. Nothing’s better than bouncing from a rooftop terrace-soiree and rolling into a warehouse party in the same leopard-print dress.

Arts and Culture,"Occasionally, attending a Bushwick gallery opening can feel like stumbling into a hidden garden of rare and enchanting foliage amongst a barren and lonely landscape. That’s the experience , tends to provide, given their location of a studio on the third floor inside an unmarked factory building on Stewart Avenue. TSA opened their doors in Bushwick in November, but the members (all artists as well) have been curating exhibitions in their Philadelphia location, Tiger Strikes Asteroid, since 2009., opened on February 22, and was actually too crowded to walk in at times! Upon a second visit during open hours, I was given the privilege of spending ample time with each piece. According to the press release, this group show ”brings together a group of emerging and established contemporary visual artists whose practices examine the realms of science fiction, mythology, alternative histories and other forms of creative speculation.” One piece by each artist, all modestly spaced and mostly medium-sized, allows room for said creative speculation, and each work takes a vastly different approach in both medium and content to evoke the themes that tie together the exhibition.,Sean McCarthy’s incredibly detailed ink and graphite drawing on paper depicts an entirely unknown and mysterious creature. The delicacy of the marks invite the viewer to stand intimately close to the piece, as well as its lack of color and thus domesticity, despite the nightmarish animal that fills the entire page.,On the opposing wall, Rachel Frank’s sculpture, consisted of a stretched Holstein cowhide, glass beads, thread, wood, and cloth, complements the primitive McCarthy drawing. It too has a sense of domesticity given the glass beads and beautiful fur, but it is also abrasive and may be slightly repulsive to some.,Christopher Ulivo (a co-organizer of the exhibition) presents a small egg tempera painting of some fictional (perhaps?) scene involving struggle and triumph. This piece seems to be the only obvious narrative work in the show, and it’s one that makes the viewer really question the story and moment being painted. There may well be a specific reference driving the work, possibly relating to the title, but the mystery of the subject and execution of the painting is enough for me to contemplate.,Jackie Hoving’s work on paper relates to the overall themes present in the show, most directly in the primitivism evoked by earth tones and the rough texture of the materials.,Not all of the works in the show are included here, in an effort to induce a level of curiosity similar to the one you will receive once spending time with each piece. Works not pictured here are by David Humphrey, Andrew Prayzner (co-organizer), and Amanda Lechner (co-organizer).

"Featured,Music","Before you get tripped up on the rumble of consonants above, get in the know: , stands for ,, America’s most diverse and innovative multimedia festival. Endearingly called “South By” by fans and veterans, the festival brings great minds and talent together in Austin, Texas for over a week of entertainment, learning and discussion in the realms of music, technology and film. The official festival events require a pricey badge (upwards of $1000), so you may be wondering how some of your party animal friends can afford top travel and lodging costs. Well, this is how you do it right.,Well, in case you didn’t know, you can go and enjoy the music portion of SXSW like a badge holder for free. No, we’re not exaggerating. You can see all of your favorite indie bands, all whilst drinking and eating as a guest of Austin ,. Read on for the inside scoop, and our recommendations for this year’s music portion of SXSW, March 13-16, 2013…,The festival, which is in its 27th year, attracts over 30,000 official badge holders to Austin. Unofficially, there’s likely an additional 15-20,000 band members and fans who flock to SXSW to experience the biggest indie music event in the US. For musicians, performing at SXSW is about getting as much exposure as humanly possible. It’s the one time per year that bands are willing (and able) to play several shows a day, for 4+ days in a row. That means that if a band is doing SXSW right, and they manage to score an official show (rare for most of today’s under the radar indie bands) they’ll also be playing a lot of unofficial shows.,But how do all of these “unofficial” showcases come about? Besides house/bookstore parties (which are so unique to SXSW and totally worth checking out), everyone wants to get their name associated with the cool stuff going down during the fest. That means sponsors in all shapes and sizes – food, drink, publication, blog, clothing – are glad to fund parties to get in the mix with all the cool kids. SXSW is basically a corporate playground, with massive sponsors willing to foot the bill to be associated with some of the best parties this side of Tennessee.,To give you an idea of who’s behind this free madness, some of the biggest unofficial parties of SXSW 2013 have food/drink sponsors like ,, Zico, ,, ,,  ,, ,, and at least 100 more. Clothing brands such as Vans, Dickies, ,, and , have hopped aboard. Music sites, publications and blogs like , (who’s currently collabing on the most shows this year), ,, Spin, ,, ,, ,, Portals, Gorilla vs. Bear, Yourstru.ly, ,, ,, and , are the curators of these showcases. And this is only skimming the surface. Other types of sponsors, like ,, ,, ,, are providing some bucks to get involved, too. So basically, if you’re willing to trade your consumer attendance to go on a rollercoaster ride fueled by free drink, food, and amazing music that’s completely dictated by which sponsors spat where, you’re ready for SXSW.,Want to go to SXSW and experience all of this nonstop craziness for 4 days straight? Did we mention it’s really warm and sunny and amazing, plus Austin is an incredible city for food, shopping and – let’s not forget - MUSIC? It’s hard to know exactly where to start – it all seems too good to be true. Logistically, the first thing you’ll have to do is get organized with your travel options while in Texas. Flying down is the best option, unless you can take more than a week off of work and feel like road tripping with a friend’s band. Flights run between , to Austin from NYC during SXSW and, as expected, are cheaper the earlier you buy them. San Antonio is nearby and flights can run significantly , if you can get a ride or take the bus. Once you’re down there you’ll need somewhere to stay. If you’re lucky, you have a Best Friend in Austin (shout out to Morgane!), or a friend of a friend whose floor you can crash on, or a van that’s not too stiff. If none of those are an option, you can get a hotel, although , or , will offer a much more authentic Austin experience, though the affordable options get picked over early on., ,Sounds expensive so far, but once you get over that hump, you will spend very little money once you’re down there; there is free food and drink galore. Transportation can be a bitch, so get some comfortable cowboy boots because you are going to be huffing it, A LOT. Venues are spread all over downtown, the East Side, South of the city, and closer to the University of Texas. The buses are a great option too, and if you’re feeling responsible enough to bike drunk, you can rent a bike.,Now that you’ve got it all figured out logistically (hopefully a month or more ahead of time), you have to sit tight and wait patiently for the parties to roll in. ,. Even now, a week and a half before the festival, I am hearing about and RSVPing to more parties than ever. Once they do, you’ll have to dedicate a chunk of hours to what I like to call “stalking SXSW,” or RSVPing for every single thing you see popping up on the internet that’s free. , that you really want to go to – these will be hard to get into and will require a lot of patience waiting in line, so get there early. Then there are the parties that feature less popular bands and you could care less about a random line-up from Scotland, or whatever this “,” promises. These are the best parties to hit up in the meantime, to fill up on food and drink, expand your musical horizons, and maybe even enjoy what you hear. Then you head to your next spot. There are showcases happening literally everywhere. You may find yourself stopping by 10+ shows a day so please pace yourself. Or you might end up tired like these guys.,As far as finding out which shows/parties to attend, there are a million resources on the web for you to peruse. Here are some of our favorites, and recommendations from ,:,It’s also easy and informative to follow a few specific twitter handles who churn out the parties as they get them. They feature some smaller or more under the radar parties that are really worth the click. Although be careful – some parties listed are during Interactive and may be before you arrive. Some of our recommendations:,Eventually, once you RSVP to enough things, you’ll have an excellent spreadsheet that looks like this so your friends can keep in the loop and you’ll all be able to get into the same parties.,So that’s SXSW, done unofficially, in a nutshell. Seem like a lot of work? Not worth all the hype? Don’t want to spend hours fretting, RSVPing, and then dealing with tedious lines, crowds, and drunk masses once you’re down there? You just might not love the music festival scene enough. It takes a lot out of you and may be the hardest you’ll ever party, but there is truly no better place for a music lover.

In the Hood,"Oftentimes, we call in a smokescreen cornucopia of occurrences because we have not yet gotten “right,” as I call it, with what we desire. If you have layers of shame, fear and judgment around what you really want to do with your life and who you really want to be, you are going to have a difficult time calling it in clearly, and you will have an even more difficult time receiving it. Getting right with your desires is the second key ingredient in the ritual to receive because you cannot invite and accept something if you are not clear about what exactly you want.,This is a task to get clear about what you want. What will it do for you? How will it make you FEEL? Who are you and what will you know about yourself when you receive this thing you desire? When you have shame about your desires, you literally push what you want away from you. Even if you really do WANT it, when you are not “right,” or in alignment with what you desire, you cannot and will not receive it.,To get right with your desires, sort through and resolve the resistance you have to getting what you want. If you don’t want to deal with the responsibility, the added things to manage, the vulnerability, the judgment, the unpredictability, the…list goes on and on…from an energetic perspective you are then literally telling the universe that you are not ready to receive it, and you will not get it.,Get right with your desires now or they will always and forever be future tense. They will never, ever become embodied commitments in the present moment. The nature of desire is yearning and reaching for something in front of you. The nature of having is to envelop, take in and accept.

"Featured,Food and Drink","Now that we’re a bit deeper into Bushwick, it takes a little more work (and a little more walking) to reach great bars. But at the rate Bushwick has been developing (ahem, gentrifying), who knows if this will still be true in a year? For now, here are three bars to visit near the 8th L stop in Brooklyn, Dekalb.,Taking their name from the original 17, century Dutch translation of Bushwick, this new-ish bar from the owners of , takes its name to heart, with a rustic vibe played up by a décor of taxidermy, potted flora, and lots of, well, heavy wood trimmings. Along with a wide selection of whiskeys, tequilas and mescals, fourteen craft beers are on tap ($5), all of which can be enjoyed with Tchoup Shop’s amazing New Orleans style BBQ and bar snacks, like their “awesome” deviled eggs ($3) or crab-okra hush puppies ($8). While it’s not the first (nor the last) Bushwick bar with a forest-inspired name, it may be the only one to exist as a coffee shop by day and a dim bar by night, effectively providing Bushwickers with two of their favorite vices – strong coffee and even stronger whiskey., Try their “Soup of the Day”, a $5 PBR + whiskey shot.,This comfortable neighborhood bar and restaurant is a Bushwicker’s alternative to the too-hip dives and upscale cocktail joints popping up all over the place. Ali, the owner and jack-of-all-trades (bartender, cook, janitor) is a long-time denizen of the area, endearing himself both to tried-and-true locals and the influx of young starvin’ artists populating the area. Along with cheap, strong drinks, he serves a menu of his native Lebanese cuisine and there’s free wi-fi. The bar food is unpretentious, the drinks are cheap, and every Wednesday, it’s free pasta night from 8-9pm. In fact, the only way you might know you’re still in Bushwick is that Two80 also offers a $5 beer + shot special.

And best of all, there were all the , people in one place at the same time! All in all, it was a really great time.,So back to the topic at hand – the matching up of the Bushwick Valentine’s Day Apocalypse Party Match-Up Mash-Up contestants.,There were three couples matched up with the help of art world star couple, , I brought them in because they are a happening couple and therefore living proof that they know how to make good matches. After Jennifer and Paul matched couples up, I grilled them and passed judgment on whether I thought they were a likely pair. If I wasn’t convinced that they would be, I would throw that person back into the crowd and Jennifer and Paul would have to pick again.,This all makes me sound like a horrible person, right? Well yes, right you are. But quite honestly everyone was a great sport and we all had a good time. Plus, people who didn’t know one another before got to meet and ice was broken. Therefore, I have rationalized all my evil doings.,The audience voted Katey and Michael to be the winning couple. I like them both very much and they are good-looking, so Katey and Michael won a gift certificate for a dinner at ,. (Big shout out to Tandem for gift certificate as well as , plus , for contestant prizes – thank you!),From my casual observance as a self-proclaimed psychotherapist, they seemed like they would definitely have a nice time. Although it was hard for me to determine their chemistry through their appearance alone, they appeared to be the most mature of the couples, not just in age but in comportment. When people act like grownups, it’s harder for me to make a quick judgment on if they would wind up in the sack or not.,I sent them a questionnaire to find out the details for you all. I think they will for sure have a friendship, which is always a good way to start out a marriage. Holy shit, did I just say marriage? Kidding!,Here are Michael’s answers with the questions I sent him:, Michael, 33, Insurance Actuary,###      (Dr. Lisa’s note: What does “###” mean I wonder?),And here are Katey’s responses to the same questionnaire:, Katey, 31, Curator, (Dr. Lisa note: I’m loving this!

Do I think Katey and Michael have a future together? Absolutely! But it’s too soon to tell exactly what kind. Nevertheless, they seem to have some enjoyment and appreciation of each other, so they are both winners.,The moral of the story here is that they made an effort to have some growth in their lives and got to meet new people, and they got a free meal to boot. This is a good thing for all of us to remember – be friendly and make new friends. I’ll check back with them in a couple of weeks and let you know how it’s going.

Arts and Culture,"Sometimes you walk around Bushwick and you know where you are going.,Sometimes you don’t know where you want to end up. The majority of the times, you know where you are going, but you don’t know what is about to come. This past Tuesday, I found my way to the Morgan Bar where ,and , invited me to the world of ,.,Burlesque retains a special relationship with its audience. An audience that every night enters in this mystagogy of eroticism with nude goddesses and bacchian satyrs. They scandalize us and taunt us to be one with them in the celebration of the body. And as the performance grows throughout time, the audience grows along with it. Last Tuesday I met people who had been attending the Bushwick Burlesque performances consistently for a year, when the troupe was in its nascent stages, as well as newbies who said it was their first time. One long-time audience member told me that this performance evolved from hosting just a group of friends, to attracting a much larger and more diverse audience.,Scary Ben told me that along with the growing audience, the troupe has been evolving into more of a performance art show seen through the lens of cabaret. They are slowly building the show to be more of a ,. They are nonsensical and they don’t follow the rules, by making them up as they go along, or by breaking them like they break the boundaries between the stage and the audience.,The show, which morphs into something different each time, was about love. A week after Valentine’s, love was still a theme in Bushwick and Scary Ben promised us “Boobs, booze, balls and more.” Once we got the burlesque etiquette out of the way, we were introduced to this night’s , Miss ,, who delivered a short and funny sketch with ,. She was followed by the “International Burlesque Sensation and Mastermind of Bizarre Extravaganza,” ,, dressed as a femme fatale from the past. She was a woman filled with mystique and stories of men passed and gone, and by the end invited us to the praise of the nude goddess. Later, Scary Ben connected with the audience by creating a rhythmic clap in unison. The Chameleon of the Tease , got on stage and threw her accessories, articles of clothing and an oval ring into a box of mementos, as if they were individual memories.,People socialized during the intermission, talking loudly, laughing and carrying the atmosphere into the second part of the show, which began in darkness with dim lighting on Scary Ben. What started ominously became a ridiculous confession sang by a clown. He was interrupted by a loud and profane version of “Take me to the next whiskey bar” by , a tease of what we would see in the end.,This last act gave way to a regular routine for Bushwick Burlesque that involves the audience becoming a part of the performance and showing off a combination of skills and nudity. It was a competition that didn’t discriminate against genders; both men and women were able to show off their booty bouncing. The best won, by the audience’s approval, a drink at the bar and a place in Bushwick Burlesque’s Hall of Fame. Darlinda rode the wave of joy with a disco infused sketch in a performance inspired by the eroticism of Valentine’s night, filling the stage with condoms as her own version of erotic confetti.,In this celebratory mood, it was time for the birthday love. It was the time for the birthday girl to receive, needless to say, the , sexiest lap dance in Bushwick.,Professional sensationalist ,, got onstage to the sounds of Bjork’s “It’s Oh So Quiet” and dressed as a pink fluffy bunny, dancing frantically and teasing everybody in the audience. For the final act we welcomed Cherry Typhoon to the stage, dressed in a blue sparkly dress and holding a classic Japanese umbrella, dancing into a sketch filled with cultural references from around the world. After her performance, cherry blossoms on stage, the show was over.,I found my way home after participating into this celebration of the profane, of the sexy, the vulgar and the kitsch combined with unlimited amounts of funny limericks, songs and slapstick, and realized that it wasn’t anything that I was expecting. It was much better, a rollercoaster into a world of glitter, extravaganza and outrageous stories.,It’s the most fun you can have on your Tuesday night with your pants on. Or off.

This forest installation ,, which was partly made possible by chicken wire and papier-mâché, was inspired by the artists’ deep love and connection to natural beauty as well as the “wonder found in nature and the ever-present guiding grace of the great spirit permeating all living things.” Masonek also describes the Great Creator as well as everyday marvels, such as birds taking flight, as powerful sources of inspiration.,Surrounded by walls showcasing Masonek and Leiser’s holographic and mixed media artwork, gallery goers are easily transported to a dreamy place. “What I hope people receive from Heartcore is to walk out feeling refreshed and joyous,” Masonek says. “Looking within to the healing provided by opening the heart, and releasing all pain to the winds of change. I hope they can truly feel the medicine instilled within the heart core of the images displayed.” Masonek also let Bushwick Daily in on his creative process: “This deep well of gratitude and awe translates into my art by allowing me to step aside from ego based perception, and create through the eyes of the spirit. To be an observer of the wonders is a source of great power in photography. My drawings are a kind of freeform meditation in which my hands drive the vehicle to spaces of symbolism, surreal creatures and inner space.”,Eric and Jay’s work truly has the ability to remind us to take a better look around and really appreciate the natural wonders that we may take for granted each day., will be on exhibit until March 16th at The Living Gallery.

Charming Merrie Cherry and BaccHaus were co-hosts. ,, Scarlett Envy and a woman with jewels on her face were the guest judges. Alotta hinted heavily that any use of food would positively persuade her appetite and vote. The contestants Madame Vivian V, Lady Simon, Gemini, and Tiffany Bloom gave individual performances, lip-synching and dancing to songs of their choice. Jumps, gyrations, techno, teasers, all crowd pleasers - no one act was alike, save their lacking use of food. Then came the lip-off competition, where all four contenders performed simultaneously to a song they were unprepared for. The judges gave their compliments and critiques, with accolades to Vivian V’s classic rendition with a stool that rivaled Sally Bowles in ,. The packed, mixed crowd of about 200 was encouraged to cast their vote by cheering.

The cast splashed, dripped and poured the water, playing with the intensity of live sound and mimicking water’s unpredictable and unprecedented temperament. This decision created diverse soundscapes and a serene environment, an appropriate echo for the theme at hand.,The opening text was taken from an interview between Karen Harvey and John Connors, a wetland biologist and the director of the ,. Dancers complemented the blogtalkradio-esque audio through gentle partnering, always keeping an eye out for one another. The recording also included excerpts from Henry David Thoreau’s “Walking,” an essay concerning the relationship between civilization and wilderness. The text provided clues towards the dancers’ physicality, a metaphor for the wetland ecosystem. Protecting one another within their phrase work and intertwining patterns, each lunge pliéd towards a fellow dancer, fluid port de bras weaved in between torsos. Circulating the metaphorical flow, companionship was obvious from the get-go.,To illustrate global connectivity from a natural element, Harvey showcased videos from Scotland, Oregon, Korea, Spain and Mexico, among others. Interspersed between dance phrases, the video segments varied in length, but all had two common threads: dance and water. One video stood out in particular; filmed on the coast of Spain on a cloudy day, Silvia Balvin, collaborator and short film subject, pranced and stretched in the shallow ocean waters. She appeared contemplative, alone, playful and fascinated. The sand was thick and noiseless under her busy toes. Saturated with deep blues and grays, the perspective made the subject appear at home with water, a creature ,. It was these quiet moments within Harvey’s segmented programming that allowed for , to have a cohesive and unifying flow.,Here’s another site-specific video that showcases Harvey’s North Carolina influences:,A cappella chants and hymns from cast members René Kladzyk and Andrew Broaddus punctuated Harvey’s poetic experience. Their singing reminded me of hiking trips and how one can choose to observe the melodic elements in a forest: bodies of water, trees, animals, the crunch of dirt under feet. These poised chants developed that landscape on stage, again tying together the theme of waters naturalistic soundscapes.,Harvey’s movement research about society’s dependence on nature managed to maneuver away from stereotypical hippie tendencies, and instead created a consistent and artistic landscape. All elements and characters had a purpose and pleasantly delivered a composed and aloof message to an eager audience. I look forward to Harvey’s future questions and concerns about our world, and am certainly curious how her work will fit into our technologically driven landscape.",I am interested in immersive experiences of all kinds.

"Featured,In the Hood","Bushwick is a land of authenticity and changing landscapes. Bars, cafes, artists – there’s a lot going on in this bohemian community. Alas, as more people move in, it’s harder to find quality, low-priced apartments. The following descriptions are a ,, not exhaustive, subway stop by subway stop breakdown of where to live and why.,. Back in the day, we called it Bushwick because it was the closest major outpost to Bushwick proper (just across Flushing Ave). These days it’s Morgantown, a bourgeois community of the artistically affluent. Most of the quality property has been snatched up already, and rent is no longer “cheap” (under $800 a month). But you pay for what you get. Brooklyn classics such as Roberta’s have maintained, even after the former Secretary of State ate here, good service, a cool vibe, and excellent pizza. And because it’s still fifteen minutes from Union Square it’s close enough to be the last stop on the yuppie train.,: If you can afford it, Morgantown has a lot to offer, even if it’s not technically Bushwick.,Over the past year there has been a flurry of activity in Jeffersonton. Property is more readily available off this stop than at Morgan, although it can still be pricey, especially for loft space. As gentrification has spread up Knickerbocker Avenue, it has led to a largely amicable relationship between Hispanics and Hipsters. One of my favorite examples is ,, whose sign-less exterior is wedged between a loosie-selling bodega and a laundromat. It’s one of many , off this subway stop, along with tried and true favorites such as , and ,.,: Jeffersonton is still up and coming, and if you want a blend of youthful scene and neighborhood character, it’s probably your best value.,There are only a few blocks between Jefferson and this stop, but in that gap is a world of difference. The number of Chinese restaurants with bulletproof glass is a sign that Williamsburg-style gentrification is still a couple of years away. Rentals are cheaper than near Jeffersonton, and it’s just a short walk to the many bars and restaurants in the area. If you’re not intimidated by the extra few minutes on the train, DeKalb has plenty of value. Plus, the bodega near the south entrance to the L offers some of the dankest sandwiches around – their three flat screens show a hundred options, and they’re open all night.,: If you want to live on the edge of “safe” Bushwick, DeKalb is a great option. And with easy access to Jeffersonton’s scene, you can avoid paying a premium for great nightlife.,I was once waiting at this stop for my friend to text me directions to his party when I heard a black guy talking about how punk-ass white kids are moving in, changing the neighborhood. I stopped and asked him why he was hatin’. He was surprised and sheepish. We wound up chatting about how he lived here back when it was the toughest place in the entire city. We exchanged numbers and although I never called him, it was still a pleasant interaction. While there are a couple of bars and restaurants in the area, the real reasons to live here are for the L/M transfer and the cheap accommodations.,: If you’re a lady walking around alone late at night, this may be a little deep into Bushwick for you. But if you want to save and live with three of your best friends, Myrtle-Wyckoff isn’t a bad look.,Long considered Bushwick’s final frontier, the Halsey stop’s main draws are loft space and cheap condo living. Halsey is far though, and with little to do in terms of bars and restaurants, you will likely have to invest in a monthly MetroCard to experience any sort of night life. On the other hand, if you have a band, need a painting studio or just want a more secluded Bushwick lifestyle, Halsey could be the perfect place for you.,: Halsey is deep, cheap and a fine place to live if you want to hole up and produce some good art.,The M train goes to the LES, Nolita and the West Village before it heads uptown. Although it doesn’t go into Manhattan on weekends, we all know there’s so much going on in Bushwick there’s really no reason to leave. If you must, however, Canal’s only fifteen minutes away on the J. While the bar scene is a little grungier than in North Bushwick, newly opened Bizarre and Skytown are signs that a more posh clientele is moving in. And since there’s more diversity here than in other parts of Bushwick, it can be easier to exchange ideas with others than it is off the cliquey L train Bushwick stops. Myrtle-Broadway, or Downtown Bushwick as I like to call it, may not be as aesthetically pleasing as other areas in Bushwick, what with the broken sidewalks and the above-ground train, but these elements add a different artistic energy to the air.,: Because it’s cheaper to live off the JMZ than the coveted L, you’re likelier to encounter the bohemia that Morgantown , to be.,This stop is a gateway to the restaurants and cafes on Wilson and its eponymous avenue. Maria Hernandez Park is close by too, and property is cheaper than if you live off the L train. True, you have to wait for the M shuttle to take you one stop to Myrtle-Broadway on the weekends, but if that doesn’t bother you, Central Ave is definitely worth a look.,: For a slight M train inconvenience you get a “Central” location, with Broadway and Bogart both a walk away.,Now that M service to this stop has been ,, look for new bars and cafes to open in the coming months. In the meanwhile, you can easily walk to those near Jefferson and DeKalb, while saving a little more on your monthly rent. Thirty years ago, Knickerbocker Avenue used to be crack alley. Today there are heaps of stores and services (think lower Graham Ave) , a Burger King.,: With a number of inexpensive retail stores and banks, and bars and cafes within walking distance, this stop is a sleeper ready to wake.,We hope this quick survey of selected Bushwick subway stops has helped you decide where to move, or at least hang out, according to your needs. Perhaps the best part about Bushwick is the quickly shifting demographics. With so many new people moving in all the time, by this time next year, gentrification will have taken another step, apartment prices will likely be higher, and you may have more young, hip neighbors. Whatever your background, these are factors to consider, whether you’re moving to Bushwick for the first time or you’ve been here since the old days.","Daniel Ryan Adler is a Brooklynite by birth, and has also lived in Portland.

"Featured,In the Hood","Better known to film fans for her bawdy screen performances and her ever-quotable double entendres, , was a Brooklyn native and fixture of the NYC theater scene long before moving to Hollywood in 1932 and cementing her reputation as the “Queen of Sex.”,Mae West was so tied to NYC’s early 20th century that many neighborhoods – like Woodhaven, Queens, where a plaque at 89-05 88th Street marks a former home, and the Upper West Side, where Mae owned a townhome at 266 West End Avenue – can boast of her, but no community figures more prominently in her history than our very own Bushwick.,Born Mary Jane West in her family home on August 17th, 1893, Mae’s exact birthplace remains a point of contention, with Bushwick and Greenpoint both laying claim to that title. Part of the confusion might arise from Mae herself. On a homecoming tour of Brooklyn in the 1930s, Mae reportedly told the press she was born on Willoughby Avenue between Greenpoint and Bushwick.  That location, even if we consider the possibility that she meant Greenpoint Avenue and Bushwick Avenue, does not seem to exist on maps from today, nor from that time period.,By and large, the overall consensus is that Mae was, in fact, born in Bushwick, though the family proceeded to move frequently throughout North Brooklyn. Biographies suggest Mae lived at undetermined addresses on Herbert Street, Meeker Avenue, Humboldt Street, Varet Street, and Linden Street, to name a few. However, the family’s ever-changing residences were only as frenzied as Mae’s growing schedule. Making her professional debut at age 7 – performing as “Baby Mae” at Downtown Brooklyn’s since-demolished Royal Theatre (15 Willoughby Street) – Mae would become well-known on the vaudeville circuit, and by 1907, she joined Hal Clarendon’s Stock Company of dramatic actors.,Despite the frequent moves, the West family appeared to build its strongest ties to Bushwick and its bordering community of Ridgewood. In fact, Mae’s famed manner of speaking was thought to exemplify what one writer called the “Bushwick Avenyah” accent – an accent that was once described as more of a “dialect, like Cockney,” that was “a life-long affliction.” Mae’s Bushwick was an “enclave of German-born brewmasters,” with 14 breweries operating in the area by 1890 and, fittingly, the community was largely occupied by German immigrants. Amongst them was Mae’s mother, Matilda “Tillie” Delker, who moved from Bavaria in 1886 and later married Mae’s father, “Battlin’ Jack” West, a former prizefighter who was, according to Mae, an “epic figure in Brooklyn.”,By the age of 14, Mae was dating Joe Schenck, a vaudeville performer who was said to rehearse with his partner, Gus Van, on Saturday nights at Mae’s family home on Bushwick Avenue. While that address is unknown, in a 1970 interview, Mae declared, “Tomorrow I’m going out to Bushwick – we lived next door to Mayor [John] Hylan – to see what’s left of the old place.” Hylan, the mayor of New York from 1918 to 1925, was a longtime Bushwick resident who lived at 959 Bushwick Avenue in the line of Italianate Rowhouses that span from 945 – 965 Bushwick Avenue (between Bleecker and Menahan).,It was likely around this time that Mae was a student at Ridgewood’s P.S. 81Q (559 Cypress Avenue, between Bleecker and Menahan), where a former classmate once recalled a teacher criticizing her frequent absences. Reports vary, but some believe that Mae had effectively dropped out of school by age 13 to pursue her growing stage career.,Mae and her family were residing at 421 Stanhope Street (between Cypress and St. Nicholas Ave) by 1910, at which point Mae’s acting resume was growing.  In fact, in the 1910 Census report, a 17 year-old Mae was listed as having the profession of “actress, vaudeville.” By 1911, she began performing on Broadway, making her debut in a “satirical burlesque” entitled ,.,While Mae continued to work as an actress, it wasn’t until 1926 that she became an instant legend with the Broadway debut of her own play, ,. Controversially set it in a Montreal brothel, and featuring Mae as a prostitute, the salacious show ran for 11 months before the acting mayor raided the show in 1927, arresting Mae and at least 20 cast members on charges of indecency. When asked by the presiding judge if she was “trying to show contempt” for the court, she famously responded, “On the contrary, your Honor. I was doin’ my best to conceal it.”,Refusing to close the show to avoid charges, Mae was later found guilty of “corrupting the morals of youth” and sentenced to 10 days of jail (“10 days on principle,” according to her), 9 of which were spent at a workhouse on Welfare (now Roosevelt) Island. (The other day was spent at the Women’s House of Detention, now the site of the West Village’s Jefferson Market Garden.) The jail time only increased her celebrity, and when a magazine paid her $1,000 for an exit interview, Mae used the money to create the Mae West Memorial Library for female prisoners.,While Mae’s plays continued to raise eyebrows (including 1927’s ,, often called the first to portray gay characters in a sympathetic light), in 1928, Mae opted to debut her latest play, ,, in Bushwick. At the time, Bushwick was the site of a strong theater scene, with RKO Bushwick (1396 Broadway, between Howard and Madison), Loew’s Gates (1340 Broadway, between Quincy and Gates), and Empire Theater (10 Ralph Avenue, between Quincy and Lexington), which was known as a burlesque house before a police crackdown in the 1930s., was the story a “fallen woman” in seedy 1890s Bowery, and rumor has it that Mae funded it herself by selling her diamond bracelet collection. It ran for five days of previews at Teller’s Shubert Theater (once the Century Theater), at 850 Monroe Street (between Ralph and Howard), before moving to Broadway, where it became Mae’s first critical success.  The show, which ran for 176 performances, later served as the inspiration for her “Lady Lou” character in 1933’s ,, which she starred in opposite Cary Grant., ,When another of her play’s, 1928’s ,, was raided and cited again for indecency, Mae’s stardom was further solidified. By 1932, Mae opted to try her hand in the motion picture industry and moved to Hollywood’s Ravenswood Apartments, where she remained until her passing in 1980. During her time in Hollywood, she made just 12 feature films but she made such an impact on audiences that the American Film Institute named her one of the greatest female film stars of all time.,Reportedly fearful of ground burial, Mae was laid to rest alongside her family in the Cypress Hills Abbey, the most elevated mausoleum at the Cypress Hills Cemetery (833 Jamaica Avenue) on the Brooklyn/Queens border - a fitting place for a woman who spent her early adulthood crossing those boroughs with her family.,With a career spanning film, theater, radio, television, and even the occasional studio album, perhaps Bushwick’s own Mae West lived true to her own saying - “You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.”","Longtime TV employee and (even longer time) viewer.

She has also appeared as a featured dancer in the major motion picture , and videos for the international rock art phenomenon, Fischerspooner. In 2003 Nicole co-founded ,with Larry Keigwin and remains its Associate Director.,Wolcott’s choreography has been performed in New York City at ,, the,, ,, , (formerly Dance Theater Workshop), ,, ,, CBGBs, Monkeytown, ,, , and around the country at ,, ,, ,, , and the ,.,In 2010 she was the Artist in Residence at ,, and more recently ,commissioned an evening of work, which premiered in April 2011 at Joe’s Pub. Presently she is an adjunct professor at , and continues to teach in private studios in New York City as well as travel the country as a guest artist.,I interviewed Nicole about her Bushwick experience. Here is what she had to say., ,
I didn’t just have one job, I had many. I was primarily collaborating with Larry Keigwin. To support that endeavor, I danced with Chezzam Entertainment at private parties, traveling a bit. I was also a personal trainer at Equinox.,
2007.,My husband and I actually quarreled about even looking at apartments here. He had lived here in the early 2000s and it did not leave a good impression. When we made the move in 2007, the neighborhood was much better. Besides our great apartment, we were so happy for the one coffee shop (,) and one restaurant (,). You just need one coffee shop to build community. The vibe in Bushwick has always been welcoming. Even though there was clearly a community here already, the warehouses allowed for a pioneer kind of feel. A solidarity of wanting to build something special here. Our previous neighborhood was like a bedroom community. People want to BE in Bushwick.,
I support all Bushwick restaurants and hope for their success. We had a steak dinner at Northeast Kingdom once that made us weep with joy. I’m a girl from Montana – home of the steak dinner – and it was the best I’ve had.,
The dance scene is growing.

"Featured,Food and Drink","Since we “celebrated” Presidents Day last weekend by making a few bad decisions Sunday night and skipping work on Monday, this week’s Drink & Ride takes us to the aptly named Jefferson stop. Luckily, a bunch of new spots have opened up nearby in the past year which means you won’t have to go thirsty for long.,Sometimes, the best way to wind down after a long day is exercise. No, it’s a stiff drink. No, it’s exercise. No, it’s…both? Luckily, as a yoga studio slash bar, , takes the stress of choosing off your hands, letting you indulge in both cocktails and sweat sessions (just not at the same time, please). After taking care of your body, treat your soul by pulling up a bar stool and enjoying playfully named drinks like the Last Caress, a mix of Lillet Rose and grapefruit soda ($8) or Teenagers from Mars, a Prosecco-Aperol drink topped with soda ($8). As you swap downward dog tips with fellow yogis/cocktail aficionados, play your favorite song on the jukebox and take in the spot’s simple, no-nonsense aesthetic. And since this is Bushwick, don’t miss out on the beloved beer + shot specials – their version is $6 Session Blacks + whiskey or Modelos + tequila (upgrade to a shot of Jameson or Espolon tequila for a buck more).,: Let the steam out of your ears with the Devil Lock, a jalapeno-infused tequila concoction with lime, orange and Tabasco ($10).,In Spain, bodega translates to “wine cellar.” In Brooklyn, it roughly translates to “place I get paper towels at 3am while a cat stares me down.” You’ll much prefer the European version after a visit to ,, run by self-proclaimed Spain freaks aiming to recreate the bar culture of their adopted homeland. Their success at creating a casual spot for locals to drink together is evident from the laid-back vibe, very neighborly low prices, and events like Tuesday movie nights. Inside, soft, flattering light streams down from exposed bulbs to shine on dark wood furnishings and deep red walls. Behind the bar, a friendly bartender is ready to pour a glass from the well-culled list of 20 vintages from Spain, France, Italy, Argentina and Chile (prices range from $5-$10 a pop). Beer lovers needn’t worry – they also pour 12 drafts and have a good list of Belgian and American bottles. And as it’s Spain-inspired, there’s also a list of small plates for nibbling, mostly fresh-cut charcuterie, gourmet cheeses and hearty sandwiches. Cash only., A Spanish red, like the 2006 Bodegas Lan Tempranillo ($8) or Borsao 2010 Garnacha ($5).,This quaint little spot was named after – and you might have guessed this – the owner’s spitfire of a grandmother, Pearl. Unfortunately (or fortunately), the crowd at , isn’t of the geriatric variety; it leans more towards twenty-something locals and slightly older artistic folks who’ve found their neighbor spot. With vintage New York pennants, dim lighting, a black-and-white photo booth, distressed wood accents, and various odd knick-knacks taking up shelf space, it sometimes feels like you’re drinking in that one cool friend’s apartment, if you’re living in the late ‘50s. Solidifying that retro vibe, drinks are served in mason jars (obviously), cheap tall boys are readily available and a mix of old school jams steadily flows in the background. There are rotating draft beers, including Brooklyn Lager, Pacifico and Left Hand Milk Stout ($5 to $6) and a fully stocked bar with a nice selection of whiskeys and bourbons. If you’re in the mood for a cocktail, ask the skilled bartender to whip up something special just for you or take a gander at their cocktail list, for favorites like the Pearl’s Cup, cucumber-infused gin with Pimms, strawberry and ginger ($10), or the scotch and apple brandy-based Autumner ($12).,: Taste the Spring-like drink, the Uncle Touchy, a fresh mix of tequila, ginger beer, honey, lemon and bitters.,A mix of personalities, , blends modern with vintage in everything from the menu to the decor. Honoring the old school, a vintage mahogany deco bar with matching green vinyl-topped stools (sourced from an old social club in Queens) takes up space in which to serve classic drinks like a Dark and Stormy ($9), brewed with the co-owners’ homemade ginger beer. On the more modern side, handmade ceramic tiles line the walls and provide an artistic tabletop for setting down your mug of local craft beer (like Sixpoint Autumnation,$6) and creative cocktails like the Chimbley Sweep ($10), an orange-infused drink of cardamom whiskey and Ramazzotti. The spot’s homey touch can be seen in the many handmade details throughout the space, from the ceramic beer mugs to the upscale bar snacks cooked by a co-owner to the tabletops they glazed themselves. On weekends, the back room turns into a dance party, complete with lasers, a fog machine, and DJs. Of course, there are $3 PBR tall boys, plus $7 Tecate and jalapeno tequila shot specials for when you really need to kick it up a notch., Warm yourself on a cold night with a Winter’s Gamble ($12), a gin drink with maraschino liqueur, orange bitters and cherries.,A former bodega space, , was transformed into a sleek yet casual wine bar serving up microbrews, wines from around the world, craft cocktails and small plates to tame your appetite. Pickled vegetables in mason jars provide functional decor while the aesthetic is all dark mahogany wood, mason jar candles, unique lighting involving a bicycle wheel, and a portrait of a very sophisticated dog named Miles - all coming together seamlessly, making it evident that one of the owners has a background in architecture. Both the wine and beer list are heavily curated, with a rotating selection of microbrews like Great Divide Titan IPA ($7) and Speakeasy Prohibition Ale ($6) on tap. The cocktail list takes on the classics, adding unique twists with ingredients like orchard peach liqueur, lavender spice bitters, oolong tea-infused whiskey, and chipotle-infused tequila (both of which are infused in-house) . The culinary focus is on affordable, slow-cooked eats (like a 3-bean vegetarian chili for $7), artisanal cheese and charcuterie plates, and gourmet sandwiches., The traditional winter Hot Toddy ($9), taken up a notch with house-infused black tea whiskey, allspice dram, citrus bitters, and cinnamon-infused honey.","Writer, editor and sometime photographer.

"Featured,In the Hood","Bushwick has been witness to a huge increase in the number of businesses in the past months - from , to , and pet stores. While this explosion gave Bushwick residents more reasons to hang out locally, it also raised many questions. Who actually owns these businesses, and who are these businesses created for? Do long-term Bushwick residents also get to benefit from the startup heat in the area or is this strictly recent “transplants” matter? We are very glad to inform you that many Bushwick businesses are owned by the Bushwick “natives” and are doing really well. Take Bushwick-raised ,, who have recently opened their second business in the area – , on Wyckoff Ave.,Both Letty and Carmen are inspiring independent women in their forties whose friendship grew into a business partnership and continued to flourish. “We have known each other since we were 19,” Carmen says. “We became close on a trip to Bear Mountain,” adds Letty. “We sat together on a bus, and just started talking. I always say, I fell in love with her,” Letty laughs.,Carmen and Letty opened Café Central over 2 years ago. At first the ladies wanted a restaurant. However, the space they found on Central Ave was more suitable for a coffee shop. “Thank god we “only” opened a coffee shop…It is so much work!” says Letty. “We cut back a little but at first we have been working crazy hours there, and we both had jobs in addition. In fact I still have a job,” continues Carmen, who works at a city agency.,Carmen is a gifted interior designer who can turn any space into a cozy delight, and Letty used to work in the restaurant business when she lived in California. They complement each other when it comes to skills, and also personalities. Carmen’s father also used to own a bodega where she spent her summers behind a register. “Any experience was useful,” said Carmen.,Carmen and Letty are both Dominican. Letty moved to Bushwick with her parents as a 3-year old, and Carmen was born in New York. “My grandparents moved to Bushwick, and they never left. They bought a house, which they still own, and stayed through all the changes,” says Letty. “I went to day care and to 1st grade at Knickerbocker,” Carmen smiles. Later on, excitement and curiosity led Carmen to Manhattan and Europe. Letty was trying her luck as an actress in California. They both moved back to the neighborhood to open a business. “Bushwick is coming alive, you can step out of your house and go for a drink, desert, or juice…That’s the best feeling ever because we’re from here,” says Carmen.,Two years ago, Central Avenue desperately needed a coffee shop and, needless to say, cozy , became a hit among Bushwickians of all sorts of backgrounds. Owl Juice Pub was a natural move for the ladies. “We sat down, and thought about what the neighborhood needs, ” says Letty. “When we were building this place, people were stopping by and telling us, they were hoping this wasn’t going to be another bar. They wanted food…and we wanted to make juices!”,As business owners, Letty and Carmen say that it is great to be in Bushwick. “We still don’t have so many things here, so if you have a great idea, you can just do it,” says Carmen. “You only have to keep in mind young audience and that you can’t have Manhattan prices.”,“As for the old businesses, it is great for them as well,” Letty continues. “The bodega across the street from café expanded and renovated. They are not getting rid of old things, but they are adding new products like brown rice. And they didn’t raise the prices.”,We were also curious about the employees of Carmen and Letty. “We have a rainbow,” Letty laughs. “Hipster, not a hipster, all that matters to me is if the person can do it and is not lazy,” says Carmen. “We currently employ Mexicans, Dominicans, a person from Ohio, and even Russia.”,In regards to the future, Letty jokingly says, “We will open three more places, and have somebody else run it.” Carmen laughs too, “We’ll be chilling at a Caribbean island…”","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

Arts and Culture," ,Bushwick’s beloved , returned to the neighborhood last Friday night in its eighth iteration, supplying an eclectic mix of art ranging from grafitti-inspired art, abstract painting, to full-blown installation and performance. Entitled ,, this “nite” boasted an artfully and well-curated selection of ten participating galleries between the Jefferson, Dekalb, and Myrtle Avenue stops. According to Beat Nite curator and , co-founder ,, his goal this time around was to be more selective in choosing the participants in order to make the gallery crawl a manageable size for attendees, and to highlight certain newer galleries on the tour in order to build excitement and momentum into these new spaces.,While Jimarez-Howard chose participating galleries that were close enough together to encourage gallery-goers to make it to all ten locations, some people were expressing gallery fatigue midway through the night  and only made it to three or four of the spaces. However, the feedback from attendees was overwhelmingly positive, especially from those that were not familiar with some of the galleries before the event. At almost every venue I overheard excited Bushwickians viewing the crawl guide over absinthe-laced cocktails (Beat Nite’s signature drink), debating which way to go and which galleries they were most excited to visit. For those who missed out on the crawl, here is an overview of some of the nite’s highlights.,For many, the night began at ,. The gallery’s director and Beat Nite’s organizer, Jason Andrew, was buzzing around the gallery repping the gallery’s current show, , Drawings, open through February 24th.,As the homebase for the gallery crawl, the atmosphere was jovial and familiar. (Our , here.), kicked off their third exhibition, ,, on view until March 24th. , understated mechanical pencil drawings capture the simple and banal in an isolated and snapshot-like format. Thompson explained to me that he finds inspiration in everyday moments and objects, such as postcards, vintage books and even computer icons. Dozens of the artist’s intimate drawings were installed in a salon style hang on one wall of the gallery, while others remained neatly stacked in a pile, seemingly waiting to be installed. In the other corner, a flatscreen TV sat haphazardly on the floor, repeatedly playing Hallway, one of Thompson’s recent kinetic video collages. The exhibition generated an immediate understanding of the obsessive nature of the artist’s creation; as if he is trying to quantify the pluralism and oversaturation of images in popular culture and our everyday lives. Tip: make sure to peek inside the file cabinet, which stores even more of Thompson’s drawings., featured ,, a selection of works on paper from an , of both American and International artists, which is on view until February 24th. The show boasts a plethora of artists and works installed from floor to ceiling, including personal sketch books, intricate collage, detailed views of Parisian rooftops, colorful watercolor and many other works that exemplify the versatility of their medium. The gallery is also the home to ,, which showcases a selection of exhibition-specific books and printed material under the direction of Sonel Breslav., , offered something completely different: walls completely covered with blank sheets of paper ready to be decorated for the gallery’s , co-hosted by the gallery and ,. The gallery was busy preparing for their upcoming show to open March 9th, so this Drink and Draw event gave crawlers a chance to flex their own artistic skills and participate in a collaborative installation while, of course, sipping on a cocktail!,A short crawl around the corner, Beat Nite continued to , featuring Crumbling Cities, the first New York exhibition of street artist ,, which closed this past Saturday. Nether hails from Baltimore and aspires to use socially informed street art projects to provoke public forum and discussion. His large-format drawings depicting images of smiling children and Baltimore cityscapes are wheat pasted to blank walls on abandoned buildings, or in this case, onto wood board in the gallery space. Nether incorporates found objects, such as ribbons, housing advertisements, wood scraps and other detritus, that give depth to his two-dimensional depictions. They create a sense of place and have the effect of transforming the gallery into a street scene itself., ,From the streets of Baltimore, the next stop was ,, which transported viewers into the Heart of LULU, a performance, exhibition and dinner event. Fitting for the day after Valentine’s Day, OUTLET and artist , transformed the space into the crimson-lit depths of Lulu’s beating heart. Lulu explores the meaning and implications of relationships and romance, through the typical signifiers of love – largely based on actually googling “love.” Images of love, sex, lust and carnal desire inhabit the space, from the sugar-coated heart-shaped cookies to a video of sensuous disembodied lips. On the back wall of the gallery, Lulu busily scribbled participants’ names alongside her own in order to establish she and the viewer’s compatibility. (Turns out that Lulu and I are 99% compatible!), ,, the street art boutique turned gallery, offered another display of graffiti-inspired works from a group of artists who have been working together as a crew for twenty years. Entitled ,, the exhibition showcased the work of seven artists: Zeso, Bisc, Zimad, Meres, Bishop203, Leia, and Just1. The disparate works are presented on one side of the boutique, just as blocks of mural one might encounter on an actual street in Brooklyn or Queens. The exhibition showcased the maturation of these artists as they have each developed a unique style and adapted their techniques to fit a canvas. Low Brow Artique and the artists are all closely connected to , in Long Island City, where you can view other examples of the artists’ work ,.,Simply entitled , current exhibition features works by ,, ,, and ,. As the name would suggest, we were greeted at the entrance by Rachel Phillips and Charles Tisa, whose French salon,inspired space is open to artistic collaborations, performances, and discussion. While all three artists deal with expressions of identity and self, culture tradition and contemporary practices, Rivero’s , dominated the parlor with its scenic and dreamlike landscape., presented , by Amos Poe, which will be on view until March 18. Poe, who is better known as a filmmaker, writer and producer, makes his foray into painting with this debut. The works, all en grasaille, are fantastic abstract canvases reminiscent of stop-motion cinema. They possess a nostalgia that conjures images and recollections of early cinematic stalwarts like ,, ,, and German Dada artists like ,., presented ,exhibition. ,, ,, and ,‘s pieces perfectly contrast and complement to show a diversity in today’s painting. Playing with concepts of figure versus ground, abstraction versus representation, and painted versus real objects, the three artists come together harmoniously and represent a deep understanding of historical art movements such as ,and ,while still reinventing the medium. The bunker-like quality of the space adds to the underground and avant-garde feel to the entire experience – just make sure not to hit your head when entering the gallery.,The night’s successes were visible from the volume of gallery-goers and the general interest everyone paid to the various shows. While some might have been more familiar with the spaces than others, it was clear that there was something new and exciting for everyone who made the trek. The galleries involved in this edition of Beat Nite created an interesting melange of artistic inspirations, mediums and styles. Cohesiveness in its variation, along with surprises around every corner, contributed to a dynamic and thought-provoking evening for all involved, leaving us in anticipation for the next edition!","Allison Galgiani is a writer and fine arts professional from Tucson, AZ, and now lives in Bushwick.

We just want a really good collection so that there’s more people using it and contributing to it,” Perkins said. “We know there are a lot of people interested in this type of thing.”,Nelson originally dreamed of moving back to Seattle and opening up the reading room there. But Perkins, a painter who is renting the studio, had begun painting less and writing more. “I felt the space was going to waste and the location is perfect, so I said, ‘Why don’t we just do it here?’” And so they did.,The collection is composed of the men’s own books, as well as the books from Perkins’ brother, who has a PhD from Duke University in global political theory. While the collection features more political books, than fiction and poetry, the men plan to expand the collection to feature more books published by small presses. That’s not to say they don’t already have a good selection of fiction or poetry – they most certainly do. Check out their full,.,“[The collection] is valuable, but we would like to outnumber the political stuff,” Perkins said.,The men hope that through donations, new members and reaching out to independent publishers they will fill the walls with more books. Nelson also plans to attend the , conference in Boston in March to meet with publishers and ask for donations.,“The big thing is to get people reading these books, because a lot of the smaller presses are not featured in bookstores in the area,” Nelson said. “Most bookstores in Bushwick are used, so they’re definitely not getting the newer smaller presses.”,The concept is also one of a kind in Bushwick, as well as the rest of the city. The closest ideas are ,, a poetry archive in Manhattan and Williamsburg’s ,, where members can look at sketchbooks from around the world.,The $20 membership allows you to check out one book at a time and keep it for as long as it takes you to read it, although they might draw the line at one month. Members are also entitled to coffee – and beer in the future. You can score a free membership by donating five books off the wish list or 10 books not on the list. But you have to be willing to write reviews for the books not on the list to donate them. The men also plan to host small literary readings and perhaps film screenings in the future.,“It’s all a big experiment. We’ll see what happens and what kind of excitement we can garner,” Nelson said. “Even if it’s just our friends hanging out, it’s a good thing.”,And if you’re wondering about how they came up with the name, Perkins said, “The reading room is small, but we’re hoping to create a mellow space.” They’re also loosely putting together a zine with the same name.,“It’s also funny because of the yellow pages,” Nelson added.,For more information send an email to , or follow them on ,.",,"56 bogart,bookstore,Jacob Perkins,Matt Nelson,mellow pages","

Arts and Culture,"So you spent Valentines Day single? You blacked out on Memorial Day? You were under the thumb on Independence Day? Sounds like it might be time to start celebrating holidays correctly. This Presidents’ Day is the perfect opportunity to brush up on some American presidential history.,History and comedy buff, ,, combines his two loves with a hilarious presidential sketch show tonight at the ,.,Sam has lived in Bushwick on-and-off since 2010. We sat down with him to talk about his current project.,The sketch group I work with, The Quanrudes, has made a number of shows in the past, but this is the first time I’ve written one on my own.,It started with a single sketch about FDR. A friend of mine had this idea of doing a comedy show called “That 1850’s Show”, as a satire of That 70’s Show. I wrote a few pieces on James Buchanan, who was a more obscure president, then I developed another sketch about slavery under Thomas Jefferson. Once I had those three I realized I had the beginnings of a full show.,
There were two challenges in the writing process. On one hand, some of the very well known presidents, such as Bill Clinton, have been thoroughly satirised before, so it was hard to come up with ‘new’ material. Then on the other hand, writing about the more obscure presidents meant that I had to write deliberately educational material when setting up the scene, to make sure everyone was on the same page.,Nine. I think we found a good balance. A sketch show has a lot of requirements. You need a good mix of gags, information, and gratuitous dance numbers. In the end I went with FDR, James Buchanan, William Taft, Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon, Abe Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson, JFK, and Thomas Jefferson.,I say I wrote it on my own but it was essentially a co-write between me and Wikipedia. It was a really fun process because I was constantly discovering new things. I mean, comedically, I discovered a way to build a dance act around Richard Nixon, for example, so that was new. But then in terms of the information, stuff just kept coming up, like the fact that Jimmy Carter was attacked by a swamp rabbit—that’s just plain fun.,The more wacky details you can fit into a scene, the funnier it is, so you can expect to pick up some bizarre pieces of trivia. You’ll get an insight into Jefferson’s personal life, see Nixon on a night off, and learn how Woodrow Wilson dealt with tabloid media. And you will finally finally finally learn the truth about JFK. Let’s just say it’s not what you think. (Unless what you think is that he was shot by Harvey Lee Oswald, ‘cause it was that.),Nah, everyone else has him covered. I’d rather shine a light on William Howard Taft.,Well… come tonight and find out! I’ll tell you eight new things about him, seven of which were good.

The evening was an interesting experience, one that I doubt I would ever have encounter if it weren’t for my love of The Living Gallery. Saturday was hosted by the fabulous Nyssa Frank owner and curator of The Living Gallery.  In true Nyssa style,  BYO Fashion evening had it’s own take on the glitz and glamour of New York fashion week.  Participants were encouraged to wear their own designs or the designers they love, bring their own booze, enjoy live performances of four bands and a live painting., ,Throughout The Living Gallery hung ten designers precious pieces. Colorful, gold chained earrings made by Jazo of , Jewelry made by conventional and unconventional materials (including doll parts!) by ,. If you want to walk around the city wearing clothing with doll parts, there was Chiffon tops made with Barbie legs and a skirt with doll torsos and legs to accompany the doll head necklace.

Other designers who had their work on display were; ,l,,, Mike Garcia, ,, ,, and ,.,Dressed in her own clothes, Nyssa’s virginal attire was, well, to die for. Drawn on the white dress was a skeleton outline and mythological creatures. Her face was also a piece of art. White paint around her eyes and bright red lipstick to contrast the white. During her performance with the band CUM BLOOD, she changed outfits to a paint splattered, lace dress and made the performance even more entertaining by unzipping her dress and rolling around the floor. Her makeup changed for the evening, as she had her face covered with red face paint. I’ve always wondered how long it takes her to get the paint off. I suppose some things shall remain a mystery., ,BYO Fashion Night included performances by ,, ,, Fantastic Planet, Jacob Zeroro, and impromptu freestyle by a gentleman whose name I can’t recall. Dream Council’s performance was accompanied by a live painting by DMT. Their sound is slightly reminiscent of Cocteau Twins and you can hear the influences of Depeche Mode.,Following Dream Council’s performance was Jacob Zeroro, whose experimental scratching got the whole room’s attention. Everyone stopped their conversations and listened closely to the gentleman in the striped shirt and leather jacket handling a turntable. His performance included him rapping and playing a saxophone., ,Nyssa Frank began the tradition of Bushwick ,when she paraded around Bushwick with designers and artists, held a runway in the gallery and displayed the pieces as grand works of art.

"Featured,Food and Drink","Whether you’ve jumped the turnstiles (not recommended, but we get it) or pony’d up for one last $104 monthly MetroCard before the fare hikes in March, the next L stop on this Drink & Ride gets you to Morgan – previously only a name you associated with girls who played high school field hockey. Luckily, there are enough new bars and old favorites near this stop to make your trip worth venturing a little further into Bushwick., With its bare bones, err, bare wood interior, it would be easy to dismiss , as yet another Brooklyn dive. Au contraire. The factory-like, rustic interior is a vegan’s paradise since all the booze is free from animal products, with the owner going so far as to make her own vegan versions of our favorite spirits. Taste and quality are never comprised; you’ll find favorites like Narraganset Lager ($5), Sixpoint Resin ($6), and Anchor Porter ($6) on tap, plus cocktails using ingredients like homemade pickle brine, candied ginger and Bosco syrup. On a lucky night, you’ll catch live music. On an “unlucky” night, you’ll have to satisfy your concert yen by studying the many tickets beneath the clear bar top, including stubs from LCD Soundsystem, Beastie Boys and John Cougar (Mellancamp, we hope). Before you go, make sure to look up at the mason jar lighting to see a creative use of Brooklyn’s favorite container., The so-good-it-can’t-be-vegan root-beer-float-like Sam in a Sweater ($10),Don’t let the name or iron crown outside fool you, there’s nothing royal about ,. Behind its purposely rusted metal façade, the spot’s hole-in-the-wall vibe thrives on the elegance of simplicity – you came to drink and mingle after a long day, so you better get down to it. There’s a basic selection of drafts (Guinness $6) and bottles (Chimay Blue $8), some “good” wine (as the bartender informed us with air quotes), and of course, a healthy collection of Scotch and Irish whiskey. Seating is relegated to thick wood tables and sturdy, so-high-we-had-to-jump bar stools, leaving enough room in the tight space for chatting up other bright, young Bushwickians. Light streams down from a few overhead lamps, each casting a candle-like glow perfect for drinking by yourself in a corner or trying to entice a pretty young thing to drink with you in a corner. The tattooed bartenders are fun, the crowd is attractively eclectic and, yes, there IS a jukebox., Simplicity reigns, so order the $5 combo of a Bud and shot of Jack, A nondescript sign marks this new addition to the Bushwick bar scene, making it seem less like an entrance to a 49,-state-themed bar and more like the neighbors put out a few chairs to do some people watching. Be careful not to make eye contact with the deer head behind the bar (he knows what you’re doing and he disapproves). The spacious interior has a farmhouse meets flea market aesthetic, with pastoral oil paintings decorating the walls and tables crafted by the owners themselves. , is the type of spot where ordering a bourbon and chatting up the bartender is not only encouraged, but expected. In addition to typically rustic spirits (i.e. whiskey and bourbon), there’s eight craft beers on draft to choose from, including Founders American Porter ($7), Sixpoint 3Beans Baltic Porter ($7) and Avery Ellie’s Brown Ale ($6)., Indulge in a boozy shake (no matter the temp outside) like the Bourbon Vanilla ($8),Housed behind the fluted glass windows of an inconspicuous Flushing Ave storefront, ,, an antidote from Bushwick dive bars, is reminiscent of a 1950s lounge, with a sleek, art deco design and appropriately dim lighting. Toast the Mad Men in your life with a selection from their list of draft beers, international wines and handcrafted cocktails with ingenious names like Babushka , a vodka-ginger-based libation ($8). Living up to its name, the narrow interior is dominated by a burnished metal bar, juxtaposed with tucked away booths you can easily imagine the Rat Pack idly lounging in while ordering stiff martinis. Dim, moody lighting completes the ’50s throwback vibe and a heated, wood-planked backyard deck lets you drink in the great outdoors year-round. They recently started offering dinner service and shellfish connoisseurs will be pleased to know they offer $1 oysters everyday ‘til 7pm. Cash only., Ward off the flu with a scotch-based Penicillin Cocktail ($10),A graffiti-heavy typical Bushwick dive that’s anything but typical – at least, that’s what we think Mrs. Doubtfire’s photo behind the bar is trying to tell us with her eyes.  With a Día,de los Muertos meets punk rock basement vibe, you’ll find typical subversiveness expected from this part of town in the faux crystal chandelier centered above mangled vinyl booths or the “Skate or Die” bumper stickers adorning the taps. The , cavernous space is home to pool tables, video games, $5 Tecates and a $6 Miller-and-whiskey special, easily recreating the kinds of joints you frequented in college – and luckily, the prices match. With willing-to-have-a-weird-conversation bartenders and a communal “let’s drink til it hurts” attitude, it’s the type of place where sobriety probably isn’t an option., Gear up for the next season with a Peak Organic Simcoe Spring ($6)","Writer, editor and sometime photographer.

With a smoke machine, some super awesome heavy guitar riffs brought to you by David Tassy and vocalist Tucker Rountree, Emily on bass and vocals, and Zoë Brecher slaying the drums, everyone was dancing. The great thing about Total Slacker, a local psychedelic punk band, is that they always fuel the audience with a plethora of energy. It was an exciting show, as they played some new songs off their upcoming album that they just finished working with Daniel Schlett.,was the last to take the stage. Never a disappointment, Brad and his band delivered in the most upbeat, adorable way possible. With buoyant, carefree lyrics and playful, catchy harmonies, the whole room was shaking their butts and bopping around.

Arts and Culture,"I weaved my way to the entrance, the lower level of a residential apartment building, trying not to step on the massive yellow lab standing sentinel at the front door. I glided past the waistcoated bartender with his melting bowl of ice and lonely bottle of cheap vodka that outlasted its mixers. I waited for him to wash out a few plastic cups that he happily filled with the remaining drudges of white wine and helped myself to a few Hershey’s Hugs that seemed out of place in the setting. Any feeling of pretense or discomfort dissolved as I went deeper into the gallery space and started focusing on the art present at the exhibition opening for ,., is one of those iconic artists who, like , and ,, has become stalwart relics of a modernist age of artistic production by which any artist working today can easily say that they have been influenced. Giacometti’s , are easily recognizable and, in their time, stood as existential reminders of the horrors of World War II and the alienation of individuals in a modern world. In contemporary times, this trope of one becoming distanced from the world around us is all too familiar as our lives are further and further mediated by technology, namely the lack of human connection that comes from the rise of the internet and social media. Yet through the seemingly dark and dreary imagery there remains a sense of humanity that these figures possess; it makes look inward on our own way of life as we look outward toward the imagery he created. The stubborn humanity and personality that can be seen in Giacometti’s sculpture, paintings and drawings, like his , (c.1947-1950), featured in the Norte Maar exhibition, which through its juxtaposition with the various contemporary drawings proves to be timeless and undying.,The exhibition features ten contemporary artists, most of whom work in Bushwick, pand roves to be just as interesting as many of the actual characters in the gallery the night of the opening. Lively and invigorating as the night was, most of the pieces possessed a similar sobriety to the Giacometti by which they were all so inspired. The two self-portraits by artist ,, for example, capture a similar obsession with capturing the essence of the subject “until it resembled….the living presence perceived at one glance of the model,” as explained by the artist in the label next to the drawing. His emphasis is in capturing the concept or zeitgeist of the sitter, in this case himself, rather than an exact physical likeness.,
This plays directly into Giacometti’s understanding of the human spirit. His figures are at once anonymous, lacking any sort of description as to their identity, yet possess a familiar and striking universality. This is by far the most telling theme throughout the show, as with other artists such as , , (2012), who takes the identity of his subject further by denying the viewer a clear sexual designation. Michelli’s tendency to continue his drawing from one page to another, held together by push pins also adds to the artifice of the piece of paper on which he draws, clearly proving that his goal is not to draw an exact physical rendering of a subject.,Other themes that permeated the show dealt with Giacometti’s constant play between substance and void, light and dark, and good and bad. These dualities that are so commonly felt across generations and national borders that they continue to prove relevant with this group of artists. I was especially struck by , drawings, whose obsessive halting lines create both a ground and void between them as they comprise a whole. By contrast, , presents his own concept of space by layering thin sheets of paper on top of one another creating a complex and non-definitive ground. ,, one of the two women in the show, also challenges the viewer to perceive space, light, and dark in a different way. Her drawings, created from producing and reproducing the same shape in graphite, then cutting and reassembling the paper to create a new shape, seem to be completely black. Upon closer inspection, however, we can see the lines and shapes that Hartle has meticulously worked to recreate., ,In this exhibition, Norte Maar presents a mature and thought-provoking dialogue between contemporary drawing and Giacometti’s mid-century oeuvre. Giacometti’s uncanny ability to toe the line between so many dichotomies - light and dark, material and space, figuration and abstraction, good and evil – will likely ring true for generations to come.,will be on view at Norte Maar until February 17. Norte Maar is open weekends from 1-6pm and is located at 83 Wyckoff Avenue, #1B.  Check out also out , with Norte Maae co-founder, Jason Andrew, on the origins of the gallery.","Allison Galgiani is a writer and fine arts professional from Tucson, AZ, and now lives in Bushwick.

Mind and Body,"Here is a formula for how to create and have more of something you desire in 5 easy steps, with a very unusual method for getting it: ritual design. This is a recipe and ritual for how to receive more, and it is a living, breathing, active biology of how to receive more. Yes, my dear, receiving is an action. To receive and to have are not the same as to be passive. Our culture teaches us a lot about how to give, how to take, achieve, do, and accomplish, but not so much about how to receive. Your capacity to receive is your yin, or feminine craft of healing and having, which ideally balances your yang energy form of giving. It’s a law of nature to have both within every living being. I’m going to give you the formula for having more of what you want, like a recipe, with 5 key ingredients:,The first key ingredient is ,. Get grateful for what you have now. How can you express your gratitude for the relationships and situations you have in your life that are working right now? Rituals of Gratitude can include but are not limited to: gifts, acknowledgements, words of appreciation, and acts of service.,When we get grateful and express our gratitude, it calls us to be present. Gratitude centers and grounds us in the present moment to all that is good about what is already happening. In essence, you are creating the landing space, the “stickiness”, and the traction for more of what you want to take hold. Your new more desired experiences and outcomes will “bond” to what is already happening that you like.  Gratitude and appreciation for what you like and approve of now is much more powerful then most of us realize. It calls our attention to the glimmers of what we would like more of, what already exists in the present moment. These moments then become the interface to having more of what you want from your most desired future outcome. Try this on this week and stay tuned for the second key ingredient next week.","Emily Tepper is Ritual Designer & Owner, Bushwick Pilates.","Emily Tepper,receive,rituals","

"Featured,In the Hood","The , of Total Slacker drummer Terence Connor remains a mystery. But one former band mate said the incident leaves no question of whether area officials ensure the safety of Bushwick bike riders.,“If they did, my friend would still be alive,” said David Tassy in a phone interview.,Police said the Oct. 1, 2012 accident on Metropolitan Avenue by the warehouses of East Williamsburg ,, and the frequency of such wrecks leaves people who knew Connor wondering what, if anything, the city will do in response to his death.,“No one’s saying anything,” said Tucker Rountree, lead singer of ,. “Everyone’s acting like nothing happened. And the guy is gone.”,Connor, who was 24 years old, lost his life in a treacherous area for bikers. A flatbed truck , within a mile and a half of Connor’s crash in 2011, and at least two other white “,” for fallen riders dot Metropolitan Avenue.,When asked to supply crash statistics for the neighborhood, a spokesman for the city Department of Transportation, Nicholas Mosquera, cited , that only cover the final month of 2012. He also declined to comment on Connor’s death.,But neighborhood employees remembered the day Connor’s body was found and noted the danger of the heavy industrial traffic in the area.,“People drive like crazy over here,” said Maritza Perez, the secretary at a Sunoco station a block from Connor’s accident.,Numbers compiled by non-governmental sources demonstrate that bike and pedestrian safety problems are not confined to East Williamsburg or even one part of New York City.,Streetsblog, a transportation news site, , to find that 136 pedestrians and 19 cyclists died in the city in 2012.,Another site, CrashStat, a project of an advocacy group named Transportation Alternatives, , to find that two of the top ten most dangerous intersections for Brooklyn bike riders (the intersection at Flushing and Broadway, and the three-way at Myrtle, Broadway and Jefferson) are in Bushwick. The site reported that there were 26 accidents involving a cyclist at Flushing and Broadway Avenues from 1995 to 2009, the most in Brooklyn and the eighth most in the city.,Local guide David Naczycz said that the area’s former identity as a brewery hub caused the traffic problems in the present day.,“What you have in Williamsburg and Bushwick is a 19th century city plan,” said Naczycz, who co-founded , in 2009 and often leads its “,” walking tour. “The problem is that you have a boom in both industrial and residential demand.”,The history of Brooklyn transportation was far from people’s minds when they gathered at Stewart and Metropolitan Avenues to remember Terence Connor at a candlelight vigil three days after the accident. Tassy said almost one hundred friends, family and acquaintances paid their respects.,“It was really overwhelming,” said Tassy, who donated his bike to serve as a permanent memorial at the accident scene. “Part of me wanted to be sad, but it was so beautiful how many people were there.”,Attendees noticed that the warehouse at 1202 Metropolitan Ave is equipped with a video camera that should have captured the accident. Though , reported that the camera was a “dummy,” rumors about it persist.,Neither the owner of the building, 47 Bridgewater Corp, nor the attorney listed on ,, June Liu, would clarify whether it’s a working camera. A man who was identified by workers at the company’s headquarters in Greenpoint as the owner of the property refused to give his name. But he said in a phone interview he’d never been contacted in connection with the accident.,Requests to , at NYPD failed to yield any comments or documentation of the investigation into Connor’s death.,Cases like this one make some Bushwick riders more cautious on the road. Local bike enthusiast Jesse McDonough noted the importance of helmets, hand signals and body language.,“There’s plenty of things you can do to make yourself more visible and claim your space,” said McDonough, who leads two-wheeled tours for Bike the Big Apple. “It’s a give and take.”,Area truck drivers agree that visibility is key. Manuel Almonte, who drives a 14-wheel dump truck to the Waste Management facility in East Williamsburg, said it can be difficult to spot cyclists.,“Sometimes, not all of them, they jump in front of you,” said Almonte. “You don’t see them until it’s too late.”,Naczycz, the walking guide, said cases like Terence Connor’s don’t demonstrate who should be blamed as much as what should be done.,“Instead of pointing fingers at who needs to do better, I think you need to put in the infrastructure that helps people get out of each other’s way.”","Journalism student at CUNY Graduate School of Journalism covering the Bushwick, Brooklyn beat for the NY City NewsService.

"Featured,Food and Drink","Bushwick, behold, for , might change your perception of partying in this lovely part of Brooklyn. Located on Myrtle Ave and run by one of the biggest party animals in Brooklyn, Bossa Nova brings the best dance music, DJs and a full nightlife experience within walking distance of your Bushwick home.,Bossa Nova Civic Club opened in December 2012, and immediately became the talk of the town. This was caused partly by the , , spotted on the walls of a historical mansion on Cornelia Street in Bushwick called Trip House. Bossa Nova’s co-owner and the creative force behind it, John Barclay, was involved with Trip House for some time. In an , he put everybody in their place and explained how Trip House actually worked. And while the wild party mansion is unlikely to host any more parties, as John told us, Bossa Nova Civic Club is here to sooth your thirst 7 days a week!,Bossa Nova Civic Club seems like it’s in the middle of nowhere, across the street is a fried chicken stand, and it reminded me of , in London — it is a similar “hole in the wall” with a surprising punch of energy as you walk in. Although, at Bossa Nova they consistently focus on electronic music such as house and techno, not on dancy jazz like at Dalston’s, you will find a similarly cozy, 1,900 square foot club full of dancing people. Bossa Nova takes pride in their cocktails ($9), and in their mildly tropical decor. Generous tap beer selection ($6) will make sure that the beer lovers won’t come up short.,Before John Barclay and his buddies created Bossa Nova, the space was used for events such as weddings and quinceañeras. Bossa Nova kept some of the original interior, such as mirrors and checkered floors, creating tasteful mix of old and new. The result is a great party space for everybody. You can either chill in one of the spacious leather booths in the front or you can go wild on the dance floor in the back.,The fact that Bossa Nova never charges a cover, nor has any dress code, makes the club even more amazing and accesible. They have a happy hour daily from 5-10PM.,The wildest parties at Bossa Nova happen after midnight on Fridays and Saturdays, but you can pop in anytime to enjoy this little Bushwick secret. The next big party is their , on February 14 with DJ  Lauren Flax, Isa GT, & Beta Librae. See you there!, , ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

In the Hood,"Valentine’s Day is upon us. A great way to avoid all sorts of Valentine’s Day awkwardness is to join us at our,It’s on Friday, the day after VD, so you have a chance to make Valentine’s Day-ish plans without the pressure of overthinking that pretend special day. And if you’re single or got ditched because of some Valentine’s Day-centric argument, you will have a chance to meet someone new. Or at the very least you can win a free dinner while getting set up MTV-Singled-Out-style during my Dr. Lisa’s Match-Up Mash-Up Game!,The Valentine’s Day season is a great time to revisit the age-old discussion of who should do the pursuing. Bear in mind, none of this is personal. But I do think biology weighs in on the side of men pursuing women. As ,of the Man Code put it, albeit quite inelegantly, “More often than not, the feel-good boost he gets by being ‘asked out’ gets squashed within hours by a biological backlash of she-male chemicals.” In other words, the ‘high’ he gets from you asking him out will only last until his internal romance meter realizes that he is now in the ‘feminine’ position (aka: being the chase)…and this kills the attraction.” And here’s some,that suggests that when pursued, women turn down offers of casual sex for one simple reason: they suspect they won’t enjoy it. Of course, biology is not destiny! Believe me, on a personal level I am all for everyone having casual sex.,Read what Ms. U has to say and then find out what guys in , told me when I took this topic to the streets., ,I wanted to find out where Ms. U’s complaint was coming from, so I had a variety of fine young men speak for themselves. This is what they told me when I asked them their thoughts about pursuing women:,One dude in Bushwick said he was afraid to approach women because of his finances.,”,“,” ,One “happening” guy told me he had no problem approaching women and slept with quite a few, so I asked him if he would initiate seeing a woman again after he slept with her. “,— ,The comments that struck me the most came from the quintessential, handsome, cool hipster guy. ,His statement that surprised me the most? ,If you want to have a good time, take risks and meet as many people as you like. Do whatever you want, that’s where the freedom and fun is, if you don’t think you’re up for a relationship. Be honest with yourself, though. It’s a lot easier to say you don’t care about having a relationship if it’s not happening for you. If you’re having trouble finding a relationship and you really want one, you can always write me.,If you’re a chick looking for a relationship, generally guys who have a lot of chicks will pursue you. Guys who aren’t keeping score on the quantity of ladies they attract are more likely to be open to you approaching them. Be careful of giving the guy you’re interested in a free pass by saying he’s just shy. That’s less often the case than you might think.,As far as dudes go, I think approaching a woman in a nice, friendly way without expectation (obviously treating them with respect) is always a good thing. If a chick is rude to you, that’s her problem.

Arts and Culture,"What would the world be like without art? What if you were forbidden to make it, or even drugged into oblivion so you could forget the possibility it even existed? ,, a new musical taking place at ,, asks just that. Directed by Jeffrey Marras and Yula Beeri, Yulix: The Opera operates in a world where art and creation is prohibited. In this fictionalized space, citizens are monitored to ensure no original thought or whim of imagination.,It is here we meet Yulix (Yula Beeri), an unlucky angel who falls into the hands of Vic (Jeffrey Marras), the greedy owner and dictator of the Theater Claim. Vic dotes over his newly-favorite prized possession, and turns Yulix into the star of his evening show.,A prostitution house of sorts, Theater Claim houses Vic’s sexy and comatose angels who are pushers for the potent drug, Claimbien. “The little pill that kills the thrill and makes you chill” is a government controlled substance fed to the masses to keep artistic expression and happiness at bay. Imagine Brooklyn on one big Xanax trip, a blank canvas without graffiti. Pretty boring, huh?,As the storyline deepens, the audience follows Yulix’s quest for a world filled with light and magic. Yulix discovers friends and fellow band mates who are willing to help her break out of Vic’s evil house of cards. Original lyrics and dance performance guide the narrative and character relationships through notions of love, loss, jealously and betrayal. This alternative take on Lois Lowry’s, , questions the possibility of losing our creative rite of passage, and exemplifies why artistic creation, in any form, is important.,Yulix: The Opera is collaboration at its best, with professional musicians and dancers joining talents to produce a high-energy, evocative show in an intimate space.

"Featured,Food and Drink","Our beloved coffee spot, is hosting its first free, open-to-the-public, coffee cupping event this coming Tuesday, February 12 at 6PM! The patrons will have an opportunity to try a variety of coffees, and to learn a little more about the qualities that make their brew exceptional! We sat down with the Little Skips’ Coffee Specialist, Sean Sullivan to chat about what we can expect on Tuesday.,
Yeah, we’re really excited about it! It’s going to be a very laid-back affair. I really don’t like when people think of coffee cupping and they instantly think of some sort of pretentious ceremony – it’s really quite simple. We’re just going to get together and taste some really good coffee and talk about what you taste and how you taste it. You can expect to walk away knowing a little bit more about coffee and understanding what goes into a really good cup.,
They’re pretty similar, yeah. Again, people may have the idea that it’s something ceremonious. But really, we’re just going to grind coffee, smell coffee, put some hot water in it, smell it some more and try it. This is how professionals get to know a cup of coffee to get a baseline for the flavor profile, how it tastes – the “notes”, if you will. Unlike a wine tasting, you don’t get drunk, but there is going to be spitting involved. Hopefully no one will be shy about spitting. There’s a cup for it. It’s all going to be set up at the bar, as a round table discussion where we all explore the coffee at the same time. The more we get into it, the more people will learn.,
Well, we’re definitely going to Africa. There are going to be three different coffees, and they’re all going to be of African origin. Hopefully this is going to be the first in a series of cuppings at which we’re going to “go around the world” – so that when you go into a cafe and the barista tells you “this is an African” you have an idea of what might be in that cup flavor-wise and can compare it to other coffees. Not too long ago, most people thought of coffee as something from Dunkin Donuts, or from a bodega. We’ve been here for a while and we figure it’s time to reach out and get the community to know and love coffee as much as us, and to broaden our general idea of what coffee is and where it comes from.,
Yeah, exclusively. Our baristas are all trained by Counter Culture and all the coffee, every single bean of coffee that we serve, is from Counter Culture. Counter Culture helped get this cafe where it is, and we’re really happy to have such a good relationship with them.,Yes, everything from art shows to music shows or just parties to get everyone in the community together. That’s really where Skips comes from: it’s completely community-oriented. We try to maintain that as much as we can, especially with new people moving in and old people moving out. Our customer base has changed a lot, and we have a lot more people coming in here now. It’s become a little bit more of a hustle to keep up with everyone, but we still want to know everyone on a first-name basis and to be involved in everything that’s happening around us.,
We have this event posted on , and ,, and we’re also on ,, and we put out a post up at least once day (I think Instagram is our most high-traffic platform).

We saw both promising bands at ,, and were caught off guard with the level of sheer intensity.,Last Friday I strolled into the jam-packed attic venue in time to be sucked into the world of none other than ,There’s not much to say about this band except “Dammit, they are intense!” Mixing drone and psychedelic rock, their music is an endless but hyper-attentive round of pounding rhythms and etched-in melodies and, simply, a LOT of noise.  Their set began and the noise of the crowd disappeared. Everyone was entranced in the energy of Guardian Alien and the commitment they made to their stage performance.,It was hard to really comprehend anything during their set, which started and didn’t settle down until it was over and my ears were ringing. I simply fell into the slices of the complicated drum beats, which circled and evolved, elevating the rest of the musicians with it. The vocalist sand into aNevermind the fact that the drummer, Greg Fox, who used to play in ,(Brooklyn’s Black Metal Band), ,. The band also featured an instrument I’d never laid eyes on, a sort of modified steel lap guitar called a ,, that featured both string and keys, made incredible noises, and is only really heard otherwise in Hebrew music and Indian techo.  Hah!,Guardian Angel is the love project of , and 4 other kindred spirits who somehow found a common passion for loud, cyclical, drone rock psychedelia, with cosmic overtones. Although at the time I thought their performance was one of the strangest I’ve subjected myself to lately, I also felt strongly connected to their unique sound.,Eventually, , arrived with a sweet, huge, decorative boombox back set. Javelin is a fun and satisfying dance/rock band who are a joy to see in person. With live (and really intense) drumming and fun instrument props, like a kazoo, these guys always get the party started. In fact, the crowd was having so much fun it almost seemed like we could start up a congo line or something. Almost.,Javelin’s been off the grid lately, and for good reason: they’ve been recording their new album, ,, which is coming out March 5th and whose single “Nnormal” you can stream below!

In the Hood,"Throw Something – but not at a person. Throw an object symbolic of what you wish to release into a field, an ocean, or abyss of your choice. If this makes you concerned about littering, throw the symbolic object into a garbage dumpster or compost pile of choice. The action of throwing something with your body provides your nervous system and your somatic memory with the experience of releasing and propelling “something” away from you. In woo-woo terminology, this cleans your energy of clinging and gripping onto specific results. It clears you and makes you receptive to the best and highest possible outcome, which might be even better than whatever you are trying to force into existence. In quantum science or epigenetic language, you are acting out with your own nervous system what you want so that your mind and body can sync up. Either way, it works. Have you ever turned on a computer or a light without knowing EXACTLY how it works? Designed Rituals work the same way.,Actions with a specific intention in mind elevate your action into designed experience and ritual. It marks a shift in your perspective. We already co-create our lives moment to moment in exactly this way. Elevating your actions to ritual gives you the clarity you need to decide what you are moving away from, and what you call in. To put down the old and unnecessary, you must release attachment to outcomes you are trying to force.,The photo above was taken during a ritual that several ritual clients at , have gotten great results from. Here is how to do one release ritual for yourself: Create an installation inside a bottle that symbolizes the goodness and beauty you are attached to and possibly forcing (like finding love on a fixed timeline or feeling like someone else has to love you in a certain way - whatever results you are forcing). Then, take a Wintertime stroll by the body of water of your choice (this client went to the Ocean at the Far Rockaways.)  Speak your intention to release your attachment out loud. “I release control over forcing this timing!” “I release control of who my true love will be and when we will find each other!!!”  “I release attachment to what effect my art has on the viewer!!!” “I release my attachment to this business proposal working out!!” Then throw the bottle away from you and release it into the ocean!,The result is a door opening inside you to something new. By releasing attachment to what you cling to, you have now created space for the best possible outcome to flow into your life without your limiting clingy thoughts getting in the way! Congratulations! Try it out and let me know below how it goes for you. I would love to hear.

Arts and Culture,"Wandering into , off of a snow-dusted Forrest Street is a moment demanding to be experienced right now. Having grown accustomed to bright lights, white walls and winter doldrums I was initially taken aback by the somber back room of the gallery. Through the doorway, one can see only a fraction of three fantastic floating sculptures created by artist and costume designer ,.,Pass into that room and the sculptures double in size from what you originally perceived. On initial inspection it seems that three wedding dresses have been ripped, stained, and coated in resin for the effect of a mind-boggling transformation. A second pass reveals the intensity of these actions and the care given to the subjects of the transformation. Being that the exhibition promotes repeated examinations, different items and moments of exaltation will poke and prod at your consciousness.,Taking the description of intent out of context: “The evocative, draping forms in Seufferlein’s work capture the colliding moment of beautiful optimism met with daunting pessimism.” reminds me of lines 7 & 8 of Yeats’s ,.,The best lack all conviction, while the worst,Are full of passionate intensity.,is a work of contrasts. Tacked handkerchiefs move slightly when the front door is opened, while tiny A-Shirts remain flat against the wall in frames. The ultimate destruction of these wedding dresses is their preservation. A bride is clad in this “symbol of bliss” for such a short amount of time, limited to one occasion. The clothes themselves are indeed more symbolic than anything else.

In the Hood,"This week, performance artist Ann Hirsch takes a stab at helping me understand this phenomenon. Here’s a psychological question that is unresolved for me, so I thought maybe as an advice columnist, it’s time for me to get some opinions from you all. I have seen over and over how my female artists friends who have been in situations, when dating or otherwise, of being judged negatively on a personal level by their work and their willingness for exposing themselves. My personal guess is that men see these women as too aggressive and not feminine (passive?) enough.  Paradoxically, quite often, these are the women that are the most traditional, even conservative in their lifestyles.,To explore this quandary, I bring you an interview that I did with artist Ann Hirsch. Ann is a performance artist who might seem to lack personal boundaries in her work but when you meet her she one the nicest, sweetest and borderline shyest people you might run into around here. Naked in public, but not even a low-cut shirt or eyeliner in life! I also think that her being normal (read highly functional) is what allows her to be productive with her talents and maintain a healthy, satisfying, long-term relationship with her boyfriend.,Let me tell you a bit about Ann’s work, so you can see what I mean about putting ones self out there in a sexually/emotionally vulnerable way. At one point in her performance art career, she stopped just short of selling videos of herself. As she states below here in this interview, , Ann has worked as a ,, as well as being ,. Currently she is doing work that involves her,. ,A lot of it just stems from some kind of middle school obsession that I never conquered. I was so consumed with being a good Jewish student back then that I never took the time to figure out femininity. Like how is a girl “supposed” to look and act to get what she supposedly wants? I was pretty clueless about all that stuff so once I hit my twenties I was kind of like, well I better figure this stuff out now, I’m way behind everyone else here. That morphed into my artistic practice because I realized there was a disconnect between what I was, how I felt I should be, and what I desired., Sometimes I think my work is insanely masochistic. I do the most embarrassing/humiliating things I can possibly think of so that I can get over shit I feel ashamed about. It’s like my own brand of exposure therapy I’ve made up to lessen my anxieties. When I started performing as Scandalishious, I was hesitant to present myself as a “sexual object” because I thought people wouldn’t take me seriously. Trying to be sexy on the internet in more than 100 videos helped me realize I don’t need to feel ashamed of being a sexual person. That my intellect was not lessened by also trying to appear sexy.,More recently, after doing a few nude performances, I stopped worrying so much about how my body looks to others on a day-to-day basis. I was like, well, a couple hundred people by now have jus,t seen everything! I guess the biggest difference in my life is that I’ve stopped wearing a bra. I used to be so self-conscious about the way my breasts looked or if you could see my nipples and now I don’t give a shit. I don’t want the way I feel about my physical appearance to determine how I go about my life.,I think mostly it is people within the art world actually who misperceive me because of my work. It’s like, if I show someone my Scandalishious work or my reality TV work, I also have to try to prove that I’m a “smart, thoughtful” artist or some bullshit like that. A few professors in grad school told me I was “too smart” to be making the kind of work I was making. I’ve had an artist peer of mine ask me to contribute an online project for his blog but ultimately have him reject it because I didn’t explain in an academic way enough how that certain project was art. On the flip side, I’ve had art people just dismiss my work because it’s too “feminist” and feminism is like over or something.,As far as non-art, or “regular” people, it depends what they’ve seen of me. I have been on the show ,on the Science Channel a few times, so people who know me from that think I am a huge nerd. People who have only seen my Scandalishious work think I’m an attention whore and people who have seen me on , think I’m some nice, pathetic lovelorn puppy. I guess I’m all those things but, because of the nature of the media, I could only show one side at a time. My goal is that by constantly showing all these different sides, some kind of holistic version of myself will appear., It depends how much I let it. When I was doing Scandalishious, at one point the work was headed in a dark direction, where I was considering making nude videos and selling them to anonymous men in the name of ART, but my boyfriend at the time flipped out so I never really went quite as far with that part of the project as I had intended to. I think most of my crazy “exploring my sexuality” days are over so it’s not much of an issue anymore. Although I do try to be attuned to my boyfriend’s feelings as much as possible while still pursuing the things I need to. There are certain sacrifices you need to make sometimes so that you can have a healthy personal life. But I think that goes for any artist who is dedicated to their work.,Not really. But that could also be because I am pretty dismissive of people who are overly judgmental (read: if people don’t like me I usually don’t like them either). Also, I think there is an element of play and lightheartedness to my work that people enjoy and that makes it fairly accessible.,AH: Mainly I think men shouldn’t be so scared of feminism. This goes for “edgy” and “non-edgy” guys. Feminism isn’t just for women anymore! It’s for men too. There’s a lot of burden on men to be super masculine, to be good financial providers, to hide their emotions. I can see how breaking out of the mold of masculinity could be scary for a guy but, ultimately, hopefully freeing.,I can’t afford to. Otherwise I’d be miserable. If there is something I’ve done that has made me uncomfortable as I look back at it, I just figure out a way to turn it into something interesting within my larger artistic narrative.,My boyfriend who is a creative writer, is proud of me for getting nude in my performance works. He mainly wants me to take risks and be vulnerable in my work, as do I. We both agree that’s the most important thing you can do as an artist so he is proud of me after I take off my clothes and fart with my leg pits or something like that.,We work well together because we’re very similar people. We’re both conservative on the outside and strange on the inside. So we like to be traditional in our day-to-day but in our artwork that is where we both allow ourselves to explore our more unusual side.  We appreciate each other for our eccentricities. But the fact that we both came from super loving and mainly normal functioning families helps us be a strong couple., ,My advice is probably the same as it would be for any woman. Be yourself, follow your dreams and do your thing. All men are attracted to that.

In the Hood,"They say there’s an audience for everything. But perhaps this excludes the scatological renderings of Bushwick resident Jonathan Mittiga. Last year Mittiga read a “repulsive” short story that didn’t go down well with the audience and was told, “You can’t read that stuff here,” by the reading’s organizer and was never invited back to read. “[The story] was about gross things. I didn’t realize at the time that it wasn’t a gross out contest,” Mittiga said. “I was simply writing for an audience of myself.”,Rather than cry, feel like a complete failure, get drunk and swear off writing altogether—as perhaps many of us would’ve done—Mittiga and roommate James Sprang launched the , (BRG) series last October at , in Williamsburg. The reading happens every last Sunday of the month at 8PM to unsuspecting customers and people trying to study (good luck with that).,“I wanted a place that was not discriminating against fledging writers who are writing things that are off the cuff and reading stuff that isn’t ‘mainstream,’” Mittiga said of his motivation for starting the series. “I think the small group of people I’ve put together, including myself, have a distinct flavor to differentiate us from other reading groups.”,The BRG is open to everyone and all genres are welcome, including short stories, poems and performance pieces. One previous BRG member read a piece detailing the stories of the individual shrunken heads that now make up a string of anal beads, while another member’s drunken ramblings became his performance. Mittiga’s own poems make lots of references to shit—both actual and metaphorical.,“I didn’t realize how much shit was in my poems until I read them out loud,” Mittiga said of his last reading in January.,Still other readers deal with issues of everyday life, strange dreams, heartbreak and relationships. Mittiga says there are no requirements to read, nor need to be repulsive, but having some shit in the pieces couldn’t hurt.,Mittiga, who is originally from Long Island and studied new media, said he wrote his first short story about a year ago to impress a girl. Ultimately, Mittiga decided he didn’t like the story and didn’t show it to the young lady, but he continued writing and began submitting work to several journals.,Mittiga writes in various genres, including poetry and short stories, and is now in the process of writing a novel, which he plans to complete a first draft by the end of the year. The novel’s working title is “From Supple to Crusty,” and is about a woman, who was conceived during an S&M gangbang, searching for her father.,Mittiga admits BRG is still establishing itself as it works to secure committed readers. He also acknowledges the fact that BRG doesn’t currently take place in Bushwick as the name might suggest, but he aims to change that in the future either by moving to Bushwick or changing the name of the group.,“My friends might have the same interests and tastes as me in terms of writing, but they’re not as reliable or forthcoming,” he says of the challenges he’s faced so far. “So I hope to find like-minded people who want to read as well.”, ",,"bushwick reading group,jonathan mittiga,the west bar,williamsburg,writers","

We found out that there’s more to a haircut than just a pair of scissors.,A well-groomed man, who looks his best, is ready to take on any situation. Pride in one’s presentation is important.,I believe there is a correlation between a haircut and manliness. Men should go to barbershops as their grandfathers did, not unisex shops or salons. A barbershop is the ultimate men’s social club and we should not allow that tradition to die. It’s not a trend; it is part of being a man. You go, and you take your son, and then years later, he does the same. It is part of manly culture and tradition.,There are a lot of barbers and hairdressers in my family. My grandfather cut hair in the Cape Verde Islands. As a kid growing up I cut hair for my friends and family. I owned a barbershop inside my skate shop in the ’90s. I finally got my NY master barber’s licence and started practicing legally eight years ago.,We opened here on the 1st of November last year. I was in the back room inside Post Bikes for three years before that.,We certainly do get walk-ins but, to be honest, we prefer appointments. But if someone drops in off the street we do our best to accommodate him.,Yes. If they’re thirsty! We offer all our clients cold Tecate or Modello, as part of the deal.,Originally I got the first two Koken President chairs from an old man in Connecticut who was closing up shop. Since the new space was bigger, I expanded to a three-chair shop and the hunt began for a third matching chair. I was emailing people from Internet ads that were literally five years old in the hope they would still have the chair. The ’80s skateboard decks and framed tattoo flash are all mine that I’ve acquired over time. The station cabinets came in from a wholesaler in Wisconsin; they came from a 1940s hospital originally.,Elvis Presley had fantastic hair. But that’s too easy. I would say Robert Deniro’s charcter Sam Rothstein in Casino had it down. Cab Calloway also had great hair and style.,I don’t think the beard is going away any time soon. More and more women like it, so that’s the real anchor. Speaking personally, I wore a beard at various lengths for the last eighteen years and I think it looks great. It’s a manly look and with a great haircut it’s good to go. I think where guys go wrong, and I’ve been guilty of this is the past, is not grooming the neck beard, going for the “father time” look. You don’t have it right when you have a young handsome face and a Santa Claus beard. Big beards can certainly look good when they are groomed. I try to school guys on that. I personally grew tired of wearing a beard when I started to look like everybody else around here. I shaved it off and rocked the skinny mustache. I’m bringing back the mustache for now. I’m sure the beard will take hold of my soul once again…,I like Clem’s or Lone Wolf.

Let’s start at the Montrose stop, where we can toast (or curse) the MTA at these five within-walking-distance bars.,This new kid on the block opened in August, attempting to seduce locals with 18 rotating taps (pouring $5-$8 brews), cozy booths, dim lighting, and typically quirky BK décor like a bronzed Roman helmet, mismatched vintage lamps, and a large fish sculpture that looks like it’s ready to dance (probably during the DJ-ed dance parties on Thursday and Saturday nights). Aiming to be a neighborhood spot, , cuts $2 off any drink during their daily happy hours which go ‘til 8pm …just enough time to throw back a few post-work drinks and get home in time to watch Downton Abbey.,: The thick-as-a-blanket Ithaca Gorges Smoked Porter ($6),Housed in a converted garage, , expanded to 2x its original 2006-era size, offering more than just the opportunity to make a few fowl-related puns. The décor’s irony factor is high, with a mix of tongue-in-cheek art, mismatched sofas, and a winding ceiling staircase to nowhere. But let’s focus on the important stuff: alcohol. Along with their infamous beer and shot specials (ex: the Dirty Sanchez, a Modelo Especial + shot of tequila, $6), they also pour seasonal cocktails ($8-$10), craft beers ($5-$7) and the classics, including a killer Moscow Mule ($8). Happy hour is seven days a week… a waste since you only work five. Cash only.,: Hot cider spiked with rum or bourbon ($8) or a “Hot Roddy,” a hot toddy made with spiced ginger rum ($8),No need to break out your woodworking tools to appreciate the rustic vibe of this ,. It’s a spot where you can simply drink like you’re meant to drink, with twelve American craft beers on tap, classic cocktails, and a selection of spirits from local distilleries. Grab a drink at the 17-foot-long white oak bar or sneak into a cozy alcove enclosed by exposed wooden walls. The vibe is laid back, happy hour lasts ‘til 9pm and warm weather will call for drinking a Coney Lager ($6) outdoors on their patio…the ideal end to any work day. Cash only.,: Seasonal beers from local Brooklyn Brewery ($5) and Kelso Beer Co ($5),Opening as soon as the weather’s warm enough, , boasts 60 beers on tap, 250 bottles, and a fully stocked bar, providing plenty of much-needed liquid relief after a long day. Half outdoor beer garden (The Well) and half indoor drinking hall (The Wick, not yet open), it’s housed in the former Hittleman Brewery, once part of the historic Brewer’s Row. On warm summer nights, you’ll find events like “Bike-In Movies”, indie music concerts (like last September’s Ty Segall & Thee Oh Sees) and straight-up dance parties…a well known stress reliever. Cash only.,: Belgium’s Hof ten Dormaal Winter 12 or Denmark’s Evil Twin Bikini (for drinking while dreaming of summer),Behind the somewhat forbidding metal-barred windows, this small, unassuming cocktail joint packs a lot of warmth into a narrow space. Sidle up to the long, burnished metal bar to order from a simple menu, consisting of four draft beers, 15 bottles, and classic cocktails done right (including a very stiff Dark & Stormy, $8). Located diagonally from the Montrose stop, right on Bushwick Ave, , is classy but unpretentious, offering beer and shot specials ($6) that take the edge off any long day. Cash only.,: Warm up with a muy spicy Diablo Caliente margarita ($8).","Writer, editor and sometime photographer.

Chefday literally delivers to your door an all-exclusive culinary experience that both teaches you to cook delicious new dishes and provides the backdrop for a social cooking get-together. I was absolutely delighted to give it a try.,ChefDay, whose headquarters is just off the Jefferson L train stop, is another culinary achievement thanks to the ,. The company was started by three French friends who simply wanted to share great food. They’ve acheieved this goal by putting together an ambitious start-up that features exclusive video recipes from some of New York’s most famous chefs for everyone can enjoy. So far, they are featuring , - including ,, ,, ,,  ,, ,, and ,You choose the recipe that you want to cook up and they’ll deliver everything (literally, even salt and pepper) you need to cook the dish to perfection. Along with your fresh groceries – which by the way, are pre-measured and pre-washed - you’ll receive a delicately designed and put-together care package of information, including a physical ingredients list and recipe. Even better, they provide you with a link to your own person video tutorial on how to properly cook your dish. Think of it as a 1-on-1 with some of NYC’s best cooks including Bushwick’s own Kevin Adey of ,. Amazing!,So I was lucky enough (well, my boyfriend was really the lucky one) to get to try two ChefDay cooking experiences. First up was the Stir Fried Green Bean Vermicelli, then the Parmesan Veal Milanese. The veal was hands-down my favorite of the two.,Cooking the dish was a breeze. I absolutely love food and also cook a lot, but I’d never seek out a veal dish to cook at home. Instead of stressing out about where to find quality veal, I received fresh, local veal cuts and all the ingredients and instructions to whip up the rest of the dish. The best part was the video that goes along with your cooking, a chef exclusively going over the recipe while cooking it him/herself. So, you’re not only watching a famous chef in action, you’re also getting professional culinary tips. It goes one step at a time so you won’t get frazzled trying to keep up.,In the end, we had a wonderful Veal Milanese meal for two with arugula, provole, and red pepper that truly felt gourmet. Although I admittedly wasn’t as full as I could have been, I was very satisfied with the quality of the flavors excited about cooking something totally unique.,If you love food, enjoy cooking and want to impress your guests, I highly recommend trying Chefday for a number of occasions! You can order each recipe in increments of 2, so you could have enough ingredients for a cooking party of 8 if you wanted. Also, what better way to impress a date than with a highly impressive meal? All meal packages for two are just $35. So, you’re basically getting a great meal, a fun and interactive cooking experience, and a tutorial from a chef for less than the price of eating out for 2.,Sound good? Head over to , to learn more, and check out their special Valentine’s day offer – 15% off all orders! Just order before midnight on February 13th and you’ll have your fresh package delivered on the day.

What makes this band so enjoyable is their capability to mix multiple types of music and form an upbeat sound that everyone can relate to.,Following Osekre was ,, a four-piece dreamy shoegaze band who have been getting a lot of press lately.

In the Hood," , ,As I like to say, “If you’re confused, they’re confused,” which certainly seems to fit here. This gentleman is likely giving you some signals but not a green light. I applaud your attitude of not getting more involved under the circumstances. I’m guessing it’s awkward to ask this guy more direct questions about his girl, but have you tried asking him to bring her along sometime? It sounds like neither of you want to make her that real.,At the end of the day, what counts is the fact that this guy is not available, and he’s not being as responsible for his status as he could be. Even if this chick doesn’t exist, he’s still using her as a , between you two. I do think you realize all that, you are just enjoying the time you spend with him and understandably don’t want to fuck with that. If he’s holding back for whatever reason, whatever that reason is likely to make him a bad relationship bet for anyone. I don’t think he’s fully in a relationship with his supposed girlfriend either and likely wouldn’t be able to be with anyone in the way I think you are looking for. I think it’s important that you see this flaw in him, which will help you to keep from taking his actions, or lack thereof, personally.,When you wrote  “…a man I think I could have a real future with” this indicates that you are fantasizing about the future. Fantasy is almost always better than reality. Hanging out in a fantasy world is pretty much a guaranteed setup for disappointment—you need to leave the movie theater in your head.,Though I’m curious as to why you are asking me this question, it’s worth discussing. I think by far, the main motivation for people to hold onto their virginity is because of religious influences which says sex before marriage is wrong and abstinence is the way to go. However, you seem to be pondering the question of whether you should have sex before you are specifically 21, as if you are going to get some sort of certificate proclaiming you are of age to have sex. ,I think what’s more important is to be able to make a decision that is right for you. In the days before birth control, it made good sense to wait. I get the feeling from the way you asked your question, that you may be out of touch as to whether you are ready to have sex or not. You are the only person that can truly answer that. There may be people who are judging you one way or another, or a whole host of outside influences that are confusing you. This is an opportune time to figure out how YOU really feel and draw you own personal conclusions. If you make a choice that you think is right for you at the time, then that’s the correct decision.,From what I’ve read, ,Conversely, I’ve also read that,In my opinion, the person you lose your virginity to and the circumstances at the time will have impact on your feelings and thoughts about sex for the future. You don’t want to break your leg when you go skiing for the first time. I think the most important factor when you start to have sex with someone you trust and even hopefully respect, no matter what age you are.","Dr. Lisa, S.P., is a self-proclaimed psychotherapist, artist, performer and comedian.

They’ve rebounded from the soft, ephemeral sound of ,, which listening to felt like the gentle passing of a season. Their new album has a remarkable drive, more aggressive lyrics and guitar, and feels more like the passing of years and ideas gone by., ,
Apparently they spent their time dwelling in dark thoughts while recording and writing the new album. (Vague) concerns of the apocolypse, and the (skeptical but global nevertheless) fear that surrounded the end of 2012 trickled into their songwriting. Philosophical musings and cynical compositions shape the album into an intricate enigma, and are softly apparent on songs like Locusts, on which Hamilton croones, “When it ends, you’ll believe in it, the way it starts again.”  Check the video below., ,Check out the album on Spotify and Itunes.

If you have always been more inclined towards the wacky or unusual aesthetic, then our discovery of ,, a new antique store on Wilson Avenue in Bushwick, will make you happy! This gem is located inside the home of its owner, Craig Cady, and the store’s contents makes it really worth stopping by!,The small size of the shop is refreshing when compared to some of the large vintage warehouses in Williamsburg. Finding something worthwhile there is similar to searching for a needle in a haystack, but Pop Up prides itself on carrying only items of value and interest.,Cady has always had a love of antiques, and lucky for us he’s sharing his treasures with the rest of Bushwick. “It’s definitely a specific mid-century style that we’re going for, we have a lot of really rare items as well,” Cady said while showing me a vintage science kit.,The shop contains everything from Pez collectibles to antique travel bars. Cady’s favorite item is a vintage star clock that looks like it could hang in Don Draper’s office. Old frames, salt-and-pepper shakers and glassware are waiting for a new home.,The shop only displays about 30 percent of his collection. Cady keeps the rest of his items at his business partner’s home in St. Louis, Missouri. Cady and his partner travel throughout the South and Midwest looking for the next best item to add to the shop.,“We find a lot of things in old barns,” he said. “It’s really fun meeting people and discovering new things.” He also takes requests from locals who are looking for a specific vintage piece.,“We try to be as competitive as possible,” he said when asked about pricing. His partner’s background in archeology is put to use when determining quality and a reasonable selling price.,I haven’t seen anything else like this in the area and it’s definitely worth a look. Cady is just getting started and we’re excited to see what he’ll find next. “It was slow getting everything set up,” he said. “But it feels really adventurous.”","Native Texan, writer and aspiring rock star.

"Arts and Culture,Featured","There is nothing wrong with spending half a day shamelessly indulging yourself with art, wandering and experiencing. For this lovely purpose, let me recommend the 56 Bogart building located right across the street from Morgan L train stop. The building is home to numerous artist studios, but mainly to 10 galleries on the ground floor and at the basement level. The high concentration of art at 56 Bogart makes the building a go-to destination when you acutely need large quantities of great art. Here is what to see right now:,If you planned on skipping the basement of 56 Bogart building, I have to stop you right there. The cozy galley Theodore:Art makes the basement well worth visiting. In the current show, Theodore:Art is featuring the works of Tad Beck  and Diana Cherbuliez. Both artists have been living and working in Vinalhaven, Maine for over 20 years and have shared a practice and friendship.,Beck works in photography, video and installations; Cherbuliez in sculpture and video. The exhibition emanates an acute feeling of nostalgia, maybe the solitude of an isolated island community. Solitude for a city dweller may sound synonymous to sadness, but at Theodore:Art solitude means the comfort of being with one’s self.,The exhibition reads like a good novel that uncovers layers of emotions and sensations; the works of both artists communicate and subtly complement each other.,I was particularly struck by the lenticular prints of Tad Beck. This interesting printing technique is known mainly through its use in kid’s school supplies and advertising, but has found an interesting use in silent, thoughtful photography work., ,Robert and Henry curated an exhibition of NYC-based artist Elise Engler that makes every order-seeking mind very happy. Elise Engler has been creating colored pencil drawings of miniature objects related to her travels – everything from her passport and suitcases to souvenirs she has brought from Galapagos. Her drawings are extensive, very orderly representations of items related to selected situations (,; ,). Her pencil sprites reveal personal experience and unleash a whimsical story within.,Were you a fan of unconventional gallery The Bogart Salon under the reign of its former director Peter Hopkins? Well, don’t be sad anymore, because Peter Hopkins reinvented the concept of a gallery by mixing traditional exhibitions and discussion forum, and opened his new gallery Art Helix in the same building (just the hallway from The Bogart Salon). They have some good art on display at Art Helix right now. Jene Highstein’s drawings on etching paper with dry pastel or chalk will sooth your peace-seeking soul tormented by the rough New York winter. The drawings are easy, delightful, almost spring-welcoming and remind us of hope and new beginnings., , ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

"Featured,In the Hood","Do not try to have your art framed at , on 241 Troutman…That is unless you are MoMA, Sotheby’s or if you own a Picasso. Marcello Quebracho is not just any framer. Together with his partners, he created and restored the frames of the most valuable masterpieces of the history. Yes, including Mona Lisa’s frame in Louvre.,“It’s not that I don’t like art that people sometimes bring in,” Marcello says with a charismatic smile in his little office. “It’s just not what we do here…” Marcello Quebracho was born and raised in Argentina to an Italian family with a long tradition of framing. “Four generations of framers,” Marcello tells me. His classical education in restoration of wood and his PhD in ornaments obtained in Florence, Italy, likely makes Quebracho the only framing company of its kind.,“I personally do the research on how the frame should look, what materials were used in that particular period, identify the reasoning and the religious customs,” Marcello explains his role at Quebracho. “We make each frame from scratch here. That makes us very different from other companies in the country,” Marcello continues explaining the process. “Each frame begins as a piece of wood here.”,Even though, they are framing extremely valuable art in Bushwick, they don’t store the art in the building. The institution holds and maintains the pieces.,Quebracho relocated to Bushwick from Glendale. “We were looking for an opportunity to buy a building instead of renting. Also we wanted to be in a more artistic place,” said Marcello who, as you can imagine, deeply admires art. “We were looking at Williamsburg but that was impossible,” he continued.,It took Quebracho almost a year to finish repairs on their building located only steps away from Bushwick Five Points, but in our opinion it was well worth it. Entering the building feels like entering a different world. The building is peaceful, beautiful and spacious; rays of light touche the layers of real gold on frames stacked on shelves, while Quebracho employees perform complicated tasks that require enormous levels of craftsmanship.,All of the Quebracho employees are brought in from Latin America. “You cannot find a worker in the United States who reaches the same level of craftsmanship,” said Marcello. “All of them are legal,” Marcello explained that it is very easy to obtain working papers for foreign workers if similar workers cannot be found in the United States.,Having a gem of business like Quebracho in Bushwick is almost unbelievable. It was an honor to meet and talk to Marcello Quebracho who has dressed the most famous paintings of all time and who everyday leaves such a legacy…, ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

"Arts and Culture,Featured","Following the second inauguration of President Obama this week, now is probably as good a time as any to take up the questions of race, class and commerce posed by Kelly Anderson’s piercing documentary, , The film is a sincere, albeit unresolved, attempt to highlight the ways in which connecting to our neighborhoods as consumers can be way more consequential than connecting to them as active members of the community., focuses on the Fulton Street Mall downtown, and the 2004 , process that saw it change from a home for modest small businesses to an area that houses more mainstream corporate chain stores. That a shopping district was changed to adapt to the needs of a , population can hardly be called a bad thing, but , effectively,lays out for the viewer the general outright dismissal of what was already there, by both government and consumers alike. The film effectively pairs such scenes as the newer shoppers at the nearby farmer’s market at Prospect Park making fun of what’s sold on Fulton Street, with the Korean hair salon owner who depends on her business there to support her family.,The notion of “retail diversity,” or offering consumers in a growing neighborhood more than what’s readily available, is one that’s becoming more relevant in Bushwick with every new bar, restaurant and yoga studio that has come to accommodate the influx of professionals who’ve arrived in the past few years. Nearby neighborhoods like Fort Greene are getting a glimpse at the future of gentrification; the reward for many of the small businesses who helped give the neighborhood its cultural cachet is often their ,.,For close to a decade, my uncle once owned one of those businesses on DeKalb Avenue in Fort Greene. A self-taught ,, he put his own sweat equity into the space, sold his signature hats to celebrities like Samuel L. Jackson and Mos Def, and put his business and the larger neighborhood on the map. When restaurants like The General Greene and Bagel World moved onto the block, his landlord reckoned he could make more money raising the rent, so he did. Today, the former site of Malchijah Hats is currently a pet supply store.,Like several of the businesses featured in , who ended up being evicted because of re-zoning, things didn’t end up so bad for my uncle in the end. He found a space further down the road on Atlantic Avenue that was bigger and cheaper than the one he had before, and luckily, his patrons ended up following him there. Still, to hear those uninformed shoppers featured in the farmer’s market scene in , blithely refer to the shops on Fulton Street as “turds” that they wished would just “go away” filled me with an anger and sadness I hadn’t counted on when sitting down to watch the film.,As a Brooklynite who has seen neighborhoods like Park Slope, Crown Heights and Fort Greene completely change, Anderson openly acknowledges the role she plays in helping to sanitize the neighborhoods she was attracted to for their diversity. She cops to being conflicted by the feelings of looking forward to having a trendy new place to shop at when she knows that shop’s success could mean her current neighbors might have to find a new place to live. It’s the type of honest admission that I could identify with as a college-educated black male from upstate New York who never dreamed of living anywhere else but Brooklyn.

Mind and Body,"Everything. When we exercise, we choose what we would like to feel like, and we choose the experience we’d like to have with our body. Take swimming, for example. It gives you a totally different feeling and experience than that from a kickboxing class does. Both are great choices; both give you very different results.,This case study is of a client at Bushwick Pilates combining her exercise and movement with a Custom Designed Ritual. She started by placing an intention into her exercise. Her intention was to get her “yang,” or masculine energy, laser-focused and in service of her “yin,” or feminine energy.,In her design session, we customized her exercise to go with her intention for her life. It’s just like creating a recipe to bake a certain dessert, talking about your goals with a new trainer. We created an activity that would give her nervous system and body the feeling and experience she wanted to have in the rest of her life.,The client approached a swimming pool with a knife between her teeth and dove into the water. As she swam through the pool, she cut a treasure chest loose from the bottom of the pool and swam a small obstacle course.,She then exited the pool with the treasure chest, sliced it open, and served herself fresh figs that had been placed inside with her blade. The title of her Custom Designed Ritual was “Marry Yourself.” It was about combining her exercise with her desire to always take care of and be in a good relationship with herself. Within 3 months, this same client got married, tripled her income by rebranding her business and became pregnant, something she had wanted!,One of my favorite teachers has a saying that goes, “How you do anything is how you do everything.” This is the cornerstone belief of combining your exercise with a Custom Designed Ritual, and this is what we do here at Bushwick Pilates. The world is crying for us to bring our whole bodied self to the table in how we love and how we live.

He has attacked several women on Knickerbocker Ave., on White St, Bushwick Ave, & Moore St (near Roberta’s),” read an email we received, which quickly became viral on Facebook and in the windows of Bushwick establishments. The sad narrative instigated an assumption that we have a serial rapist in Bushwick who needs to be put behind the bars asap. Our readers have constantly asked what is going on.,We have called the 83rd Precinct of NYPD multiple times. Earlier in January, an officer refused to confirm one individual suspect, and told us that Bushwick is one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the City, and everybody should always be careful. He recommended never walking alone, especially late at night, women and men alike. A very basic ,, in addition to the numerous comments under our ,, shows that thinking that Bushwick has only one serial rapist would be optimistic. Dangerous streets are the reality in Bushwick.,NYPD further referred us to the , they publish weekly on their website. Currently available stats for the week of January 7 – January 13, 2012  in the 83rd Precinct list: 2 rapes, 1 misdemeanor sex assault and 8 misdemeanor assaults. However, following the ,, many believe that NYPD stats are underreported; additionally we have to take into account that many of the assaults don’t get reported at all. “I met with top officers of the 83rd, 90th & 94th precincts. They can’t serve you if no one is reporting these incidents that have been going on in Bushwick and Williamsburg area. They can’t deploy their resources if they don’t know what’s happening.

Unfortunately, the Post chose to interview only white looking women (not actual victims, only women who “heard” about the attacks), sparking a reaction on the Internet that these attacks are some sort of a racially motivated response to the recent gentrification of the neighborhood. However, comparing , over the years shows that safety has been a consistent problem in the area. According to statistics published by the NYPD’s 83rd Precinct, there were 39 reported rapes in 2012. In 1990, there were more than twice as many - the precinct reported 80 rapes. Unfortunately, this situation is a problem for all the women in the area because they are especially vulnerable targets.,What can we do to be safer in Bushwick today? Follow the recommendations of NYPD and Brooklyn Bike Patrol. Don’t walk alone after dark and use common sense when it comes to especially dangerous areas such as the borders of the precincts (e.g. Broadway, according to the officer from the 83 Precinct that we talked to).

In the Hood,"I was really pleased to read James Ryder’s recent article, , James writes: ,As a relatively recent hetero transplant from Chelsea, I was surprised to read this since Chelsea seemed much more sexually segregated. I really enjoy how much the LGBTQ community feels integrated in a particularly healthy way in Bushwick. But James’ article highlighted that there simply aren’t enough places to go for queers to socialize just with each other.,I hadn’t thought about this until now and I felt James was doing us a service by bringing the topic to the table. Of course, just as any article involving sexual politics, the comments had the usual back and forth sniping. FishBait BK wrote, , And a comment from MushRoom indicated he was happy with the way things are, ,The comments showed that some queer people think all is good in Bushwick, while others hint at a seemingly repressed anger in the queer community towards breeders. I wanted to get the issues out in the open, ,, which I hope will help illuminate the Bushwick LGBTQ point of view for the rest of us., , I would definitely have to agree that New York City, in general, is a place where one can be themselves entirely and find many others that will share their life experience without judgment in regards to sexual orientation, gender expression, race, nationality, religion, or other identity traits. I think many people who come here or live here are still a bit hetero-biased, meaning they live their lives with and around straight people and while they vocally support gay rights, but they aren’t going to make any extra effort to befriend LGBTQ people in the area. Many of my friends and I discuss the simple DIFFERENCE LGBTQ people feel when they speak to those in their own community versus speaking to heterosexuals. Many cis heterosexuals are incredibly well-intentioned, but are oblivious to their own internally embedded beliefs that sometimes surface in the form of hetero-bias without quite realizing it.  One man, someone I’ve known for a while and who I’m comfortable with, had no idea that saying, “Well, I think gay people are totally fine. I have no problem with them, but I do think they’re unnecessary… I mean, they don’t reproduce.” But I think a constructive and realistic perspective on the hetero-bias of the people living in and moving into Bushwick is beneficial to the growth of the region MUCH MORE than living in an idealistic delusion in which LGBTQ people, especially the T and Q on that spectrum, face bias and estrangement., From my article from last week, someone wrote a great comment on how social media and applications specifically designed for gay men to date one another has completely changed the social landscape for queers in areas like Bushwick. It changes the demand for specifically designated gay bars, because one only needs to turn on his phone in order to chat with other openly gay men in his neighborhood. I think, also, events and parties that are queer in Bushwick are more focused on artistic expression and integrity, because with applications and dating sites hooking up has become a side note to nightlife rather than the main attraction. I still need to spend more time analyzing how these applications and sites affect the gay community in Bushwick versus the straight community, but I would definitely say that they have made a major impact.,  ,Gender, gender, gender. It is constantly and continually frustrating how often heterosexual people (and, in fact, many gay people) correlate gender and sex. The gender of which you identify, your gender expression, and your biological sex are not innately interlinked. I feel that throughout my life I, and many of the LGBTQ people I’ve known, have experienced less direct homophobia (that is, hatred or fear based simply on orientation) and much more discrimination based on our gender expression. Constantly, the humanity and value of effeminate gay men is undermined and outright denied. In the most recent election, gay political prodigy Nate Wizard was called “too effeminate” to be able to accurately predict the results. This correlation between trivial “feminine” traits - a high voice, a particular way of walking, etc. – and stupidity is, in my eyes, outright sexism., , Well, each individual wants something completely different. Writers and editors of the Advocate are most likely proponents of (at least legal) integration, while activists such as the queer group Bash Back! are steadfastly anti-assimilationist. It’s undeniable that most people want to be respected in their community. While I think it would be pretty difficult NOT to assimilate to some extent, some of the writings of activists such as those in the Bash Back! collective and the academic writings of queer theorists are incredibly interesting and discuss the option of deconstructing what it means to be part of a heteronormative society, what limits that society places upon the individual, and whether or not queers should be trying to imitate and integrate into such an oppressive society. I think a lot of queers now are discussing how the fundamental social norms (those very same things we talked about above that straights take for granted) are actually constructs built upon the exclusion and oppression of queers. Some of us want to change those social constructs altogether, starting with the polarity of sexuality and gender.,As for the second part of the question, all I can say is that if a heterosexual person in Bushwick is already open-minded enough to think to themselves, “How can I be more accepting of queer people?” then I would hope they would take that extra step to really think about how they think and feel about what it means to be gay and perhaps even read some feminist and queer literature. The expansion of their perspective on the matter just by reading contemporary social theory will inevitably change the way they interact with everyone around them, including LGBTQ people.,Mainly this all sounds a bit self-conscious to me. I wonder if part of the reason you’re having trouble identifying who you’re attracted to is because you are thinking about it too much and it’s getting in the way of your using your instincts. It seems as if you’re evaluating the potential men as either “the same” or “different” from you. Maybe try not to try so hard to think about why you are/are not interested in them. Simply see if you have fun with someone enough to want to spend more time with them, regardless of the details. Being attracted to straight men, in your case, likely means that you are attracted to unavailable people, which generally would say that you may have a fear of getting close to someone who is a real possibility for you.","Dr. Lisa, S.P., is a self-proclaimed psychotherapist, artist, performer and comedian.

Music,"In the last moments of poise before the internet music machine squats down and shits out 2013, I’d like to take a look back at three great artists who came up this past year. I’d venture to say they all produced under-appreciated records, but to be honest I’m nauseated by music journalism so probably I’m unqualified to make statements like that or to write about music at all, but hey, I’m just here playing my trumpet. Let’s finish this up before I puke in my lap.,
 ,The self-titled debut from Swedish producer Axel Backman (aka 1991) is beautiful and screwed and dark. On the single “Open To The Dark,” a well placed snippet of The Cure’s “,” loops amid 1991′s spiraling analog haze in a manner that defines the record’s best moments.,Looking forward, if the bleepingly maniacal tracks on , offer any clues about future output, then 2013 is going to see this dude coming out of left field over and over again., was released by Bristol label ,.,
 ,Anyone who’s come to my house for slow jams & wine knows that music gets extra points if it could be mistaken for a Vanessa Williams B-side. But what makes “My Refuge” incredible is not it’s homage to sweet histories, but it’s sharp turn into transcendence. That pause after the opening keyboard passage is really long, and very necessary, because the following plunge is literally into the future.,Also, future is the real conversation here. Napolian was only 19 or 20 when this was recorded. The record shows sonic ability, drum smarts, instrumentalism, and real songwriting talent. I seriously hope this kid lands in the stables at Def-Jam cause I can’t fucking wait to hear the Napolian/Ocean/Bieber hit-parade.,Stream the entire , ,, courtesy of Brooklyn’s ,.,
 ,Like most of Anduin’s ,, “Dyadic 27″ is incredibly stylish and immediately terrifying. Over a backdropped synth canvas, Richomond VA’s Jonathan Lee layers the snick and scratch of worn 20th century apparatuses. The song’s gentle narrative curve leads the listener on a singular search. Somewhere along the way, a saxophone turns up and lets out a few lonely secrets, and that’s the moment when I really fall for this record. This is truly music to inspire revelatory investigations, but let’s be careful what we dig up.,Stream Anduin’s Stolen Years in it’s entirety , and pick up a copy via label ,.","Matthew Sanders started hating music in 2010.

No membership fee, no awkward moments with people huffing and puffing right next to you, and all the sights and experiences you can hope for. Bundle up and visit a friend you haven’t seen in a while or bike to a part of Brooklyn or Queens you’ve never been to. Do your research about roads with bike lanes to make your trip less stressful. I recently rode over the Williamsburg Bridge and then did some gallery crawling through the Lower East Side. Make sure to keep warm with these essentials:,1. Gloves! Lined ones would be best; strictly cotton let way too much wind through.,2. Warm hat or headband (and helmet! You’ve seen the reports of recent bike accidents…),3. Scarf! A warm one, but not one that’s so big you won’t be able to look to the side.,4. Thick socks and boots.,5. Layers! Leggings under pants, a breathable shirt, a warm sweater, plus a decent wind-breaking, but movable, coat., ,Another all year long favorite workout for the brave ones is to walk or run from Bushwick to Manhattan three times a week over the Williamsburg Bridge. , The bridge crossing is particularly enjoyable in the winter because, besides doing this, my lazy butt would likely be indoors all winter. Plus, you can remind yourself of how great fresh air is and how manageable the cold is when you are moving! Besides feeling great physically and mentally, I have actually lost weight this way, according to the comments I get (I am afraid of the scale), and I have dropped one jeans size - all without any extra dieting, which was not true of the body conditioning workouts I did at the gym before I moved to Brooklyn. Most importantly, this workout has a meditative quality, which has really helped me think clearly and feel relaxed for the rest of the day. , ",,"biking,bikram yoga,bikram yoga williamsburg,boxing,Green Fitness Studio,running,walking,warm workout","

Music,"I’m sure that reference has been made before. No, but really, listening to this band is like jumping, hopping, leaping, falling into a sound. No word describes their sound more than oceanic. So, listening to Brooklyn’s , is like taking a bath- closing your eyes and allowing yourself to be clothed in silky waves of reverb.

It’s an immersive record- one full of soaring optimism and carefully plucked tranquility, peek around corners to reveal ominously dark melodies. All these spacey melodies driven by a robust drum sound driven by punk rhythms that somehow meshes perfectly.,One thing that will strike you, especially seeing the band live- is that diiv’s founder, writer and singer, Cole Smith, is not actually the main voice of the song. That part goes to his soaring guitar, with parts that linger in a rainbow of atmospheric emotion. Then comes the second guitar, sometimes piling layers of disorienting noise, sometimes dueling with the first guitar or bass to fold in lush, complex melodies. His sparse vocals ground the sound and lend tangible thoughts to the music, which otherwise would have swept us away long ago.,The band took the stage with a passion, determined and seemingly fresh. With good reason; they’ve been MIA for a while. At one time, you couldn’t escape the band. Literally, if you are a show-goer you would have noticed them opening on at least a bill a week every week. They became a Brooklynite’s household name, but they were less polished, carrying a less defined sound, a little boring ,.

In the Hood,"Have you ever noticed how when you try to move past something, that the more you tell yourself to “drop it” and “let it go,” the louder and more demanding that very thing becomes? We try to shut out, chop off and not acknowledge something, but the pushing away actually makes that very thing scream for your attention like a crying baby.,The problems this creates are innumerable. So much ammunition to beat yourself up gets created. So many reasons now to be angry both with yourself and with others involved in the situation. “Damn, I can’t seem to get over this thing and stop thinking about it. Shame on me for not having better mind control! Shame on you for ‘making me’ feel this way, act this way.” Now, not only does the original pain point still exist, but you are also aiming arrows at both yourself and at others around you.,Do you experience aversion in your life constantly? If you are a human being (if you are reading this, you are at least half human), then the answer is most likely yes. From a Buddhist perspective, our life fluctuates wildly between craving and aversion. All of your suffering is caused by bouncing back and forth between what you crave and what you are averse to experiencing.,In straight up Buddhism, you learn to be non-reactive to cravings and aversions, and I have to say, the eightfold path is the shizzle. Recently, I went on a 10 day Vipassana meditation sit. In Vipassana meditation, you learn to be friends with reality not as you would like it to be, but rather with “what is.” The key is to experience everything in your life merely as a physical sensation that rises up in your experience and then after some time passes away, sort of like bubbles coming from carbonated water - rising and passing away, rising and passing away.,From a ritualistic perspective, I find moments of aversion to be massive opportunities. The next time you really do or do not want to do something, feel something or say something, reframe your aversion as an opportunity. For example, I really do not want to do my taxes. However, it is a profound opportunity to get a clear bird’s-eye view of the life I created last year. It is a beautiful opportunity to create a time capsule of 2012. As my customized ritual for January, I am now artfully designing an entire time capsule of my 2012 experience. It’s the aversion conversion. The next time you are completely averse to a situation, pretend your life is a basketball game and convert the point with this ritual.","Emily Tepper is Ritual Designer & Owner, Bushwick Pilates.","buddhism,Bushwick Pilates,column,Emily Tepper,rituals,the ritualist","

"Featured,Mind and Body","You would expect anything but the sweet smell of burning incense when you get off the L train on the Jefferson stop.

The incense belongs to , that opened in December 2012 in Bushwick.,This great location of Good Yoga, right at the top of the steps from the L train on Wyckoff Ave has been causing many curious visitors to pop in and ask about this new addition to the neighborhood. Good Yoga Bushwick (or Goodwick, as they lovingly call it) is one of three Good Yoga locations. The first one opened in 2009 in Greenpoint. Its founders Flannery Foster and Raymond Gonzales have traveled the world, and wanted to open an urban ashram, a sanctuary of yoga and community. Good Yoga in Greenpoint also has guest rooms for travelers and out-of-city participants of their yoga teacher program.

And then we found this amazing space.” Jen looked around the studio with infatuation. We have to agree. Good Yoga space is truly exceptional.

In the Hood,"My last week’s article , sparked a lot of discussion, and I decided to try and expand my knowledge of what others have pointed out is a very active, albeit somewhat jumbled, queer nightlife scene. One of the parties I’ve heard a lot about is the regular , party at , on 59 Montrose Avenue. The party features artists, shows, androgynous drag performers, and attracts a slew of very interesting characters. Previous parties have featured various colors of the rainbow, a tribute to the diversity of both the performances and the crowd that gathers within The Spectrum. This week, however, was focused on the “Temptation of the Flesh Tones” which brought the costumes and performances into a new realm that left little to the imagination and yet still sparked the creative spirit in everyone present.,The “OVA THE RAINBOW” parties have been going on for almost a year now and  The Spectrum is actually a “Multi-purpose queer space” that is mostly run and leased out by a queer named Gauge, who performs in the space during the “OVA THE RAINBOW” Saturday night parties. However, the space is also home to yoga, local artists’ exhibitions, and various gatherings on other nights of the week.,
For only $5 before midnight, or $7 after 12AM, one can enjoy a decently sized dance floor complete with a cheap beer and mixed drink bar and décor that reminds one of being in a designer’s studio. A DJ spins remixes of Bjork, Die Antwoord, and Nancy Sinatra in the back beside a couch/stage and a full-length stripper pole! Later in the night, the music moved into trance, funk, electro beats and remixes of nineties R&B that led into some very skillfully performed vogueing by two partygoers. While many of the people there were making out in the dimly lit hallway beside the bathroom by the time I left, I got the feeling that most of the queers present came not just to hook up but also to experience The Spectrum’s unique space and catch a glimpse of this week’s performances. Gio Black Peter who is well-known in the NYC queer art scene performed in an all-white outfit that reminded me of Gengar from the original Pokemon cast. He quickly stripped his costume off, however, as per the flesh-toned theme, and rapped alongside the DJ. Another performance featured an androgynous drag queen draped in peach-colored fabric that twisted around as ze moved in rhythm to an electronic, breakbeat tune.,
Many of the people in attendance were as eye-catching as the performers, clothed in long robes, leather harnesses, crowns, and all sorts of mixed fabrics.,The Spectrum’s party made me feel a lot more connected to the very diverse and artistic LGBTQ community living in and around Bushwick. I felt comfortable and enlivened in a creative space filled with queers of all shapes, colors and sizes contented and excited enough to express themselves freely. Many of the people at “OVA THE RAINBOW” are artists, performers, musicians, writers and the like who make Bushwick the intensely inspiring place that it has become. When I poked in my earlier article about wanting a space that is designated as specifically queer, I imagined something like “The Spectrum” wherein heteronormative social conduct doesn’t stifle the imaginative endeavors of queer artists, though allies and others are obviously welcome to experience what is borne of such a space as well. (In fact, I saw more than a few at The Spectrum.) “OVA THE RAINBOW” is most definitely a party any queer needs to experience if they are living in Bushwick and the greater New York area. The party is as exciting for what it is as for what it says about what queers have brought and will continue to bring to the Bushwick social landscape., , , ","Writer, I guess, Bartender, and Music and Kitten lover.

Food and Drink,"I’ve driven hundreds of miles with my brothers, father and best friend in search of Cuban Sandwiches that are more than just passable. They have to be made with heart and have a spark that belies the simplicity of the ingredients. It’s an easy thing to phone in and miss. But when done right, the bliss is effervescent. One sign of a place with potential is the quality of their ,. It was by this mark that I first judged , on Suydam and Wilson. My first time was splendid.,To go with the , ($3.75) I generally order a, ($3.00) – Cuban bread pressed with melted butter and perfect for dipping in the coffee. I started going here shortly after the place opened in September of 2012 – and wondered if my initial joy was a symptom of having been away from Florida for so long.,Upon repeat visits, I could see that the coffee was consistently delicious. I would quietly return and talk with the owner Jeremy Sapienza and his brother Mike, both of whom are from South Florida. It’s an easy ordeal to get loaded on caffeine here – the coffees also benefit from the authority of authenticity. No small task considering that the purveyors are not of Cuban origin – and have recreated their Florida from memory.,However, the most important question had to be answered. That is: How is the Cuban Sandwich ($8.00)?,First of all, I would take any of my companions from the Cuban Sandwich search here with confidence. The pork is tender, the bread authentic and local, the mustard is coarse, the pickles are from the Eastern European inspired kitchen at ,, and the whole thing is pressed thin before being cut diagonally.

The Cuban sandwiches of my youth are gone. This is the first memorable Cuban Sandwich I’ve eaten since moving to New York.,One thing that adds to the enjoyment of coming here is the effortless Florida casual attitude exuded by the décor and proprietors.

"Featured,Music","Listen, up Bushwick, we’ve got a music recommendation for you. Brooklyn-via Texas alt & punk band , is here to buzz around in your lobes. I caught the 4-piece last week at Williamsburg DIY Venue , where their sound inspired heavy boozing, moshing, and even some crowd surfing.,Parquet Courts, who live in Bed-Stuy, has been garnishing a lot of praise recently for their jangly indie punk sound. They’ve got just the right amount of earnestness in their chords to poke through the don’t-give-a-fuck Brooklyn rockstar mentality. Equal parts rambling punk rhythms, flying guitar and sharp lyrical jabs, these guys are a band to watch 2013.,Take, for example, their single, “,.” The singer paints a (far too familiar) picture- “I was walking through Ridgewood, Queens. I was flipping through magazines. I was so stoned and starving.” And, though, humor plays a big roll in their lyrics, sometimes they mix in serious(ly smart) sentiments, which are more poetic than lyrical. On another quality tune, ,, they penned an intelligent cuplet- “Dreary beats over fast-rapped verses / leaked through windows in hatchback hearses.”,There’s enough of a hunger for a legitimately good alternative/punk scene in Brooklyn that the show was sold out by 10 pm and the tiny venue was packed all the way to the painted walls. Openers , set the scene with a funky, layered, and drugged-out psychadelic energy. Then Parquet Courts ripped through their debut album, ,, with a fierce freshness. Of course, the crowd took their part in making the show memorable, moshing, throwing elbows, spilling beer, and even crowd surfing.,Head over to ,to hear the album, and watch out for them playing local shows and on tour.

Arts and Culture,"The gallery of , is large and unusual. To hang any sort of cohesive show might propose a challange — just imagine, one of the long walls consists of 10 foot wide sections interrupted by partitions. However, , curated by David Gibson has successfully conquered this task. The overarching themes that link all of the works in the show are mysterious familiarity and otherworldly perceptions.,A little space behind the curtains when you first walk into the gallery is dedicated to a set of four lightboxes with film, by Anne Arden McDonald. With titles like “Eyelash” and “Couples,” they seem very intentional and about a certain event or idea of the artist’s experience, but recognizable forms are scarce, besides a simple outline of a dress, a leaf, and what seems like sperm fighting to fertilize an egg. Each piece emulates the feeling of looking through a microscope, but at a thought rather than a known thing.,The sculptures/collages by Jeanne Tremel are made of purposeful materials such as yarn, fruit, and a dishwashing rack, but she combines them in ways to make dreamlike and naive objects and scenes. They have the potential to be used, yet what for is unknown. They pair very well with the mixed media collages on newspaper by Elissa Levy. These too are works that could have been utilized (for reading the news) but the artist paints on and cuts them to transform them into mysteriously beautiful and domestic works. The viewer is curious about the stories that are covered up, but presented with the artists unique formal reactions to pictures and print.,Madora Frey’s large prints of either foliage or mysterious (construction?) materials are more relatable to familiar objects than the rest of the work in the show, yet still distort perception to a unique degree. The scale and field of depth in the work allows the viewer to become immersed in them, but each piece belongs in a completely different environment and gives a hallucinogenic feeling of confusion.,Work by Carter Hodgkin, Michael Zansky, and Jonathan Feldschuh all seem to relate in ways regarding their materials, mark-making, and color. Hodgkin’s paintings could be depicting aquatic life or remnants of celebrations, Zansky’s seem to be surreal portraits of machines or decorations, and Feldschuh’s, with titles like “Large Hadron Collider,” may be interiors of industrial mechanics or an uncomfortable place. All use color in a dramatic way, Zansky’s tondo canvases create a shrine-like illusion, and the scale and transparency of Feldschuh’s mylar works allude to preparatory sketches while depicting warped perceptions.,Thomas Frontini’s two paintings stand out from the rest. In content, they are very much on par with the sense of mysticism and surrealism present in the whole show, but the richness of the color and peculiarity of the scenes really make them unique., ","Artist, gallerist, and bike enthusiast.","Alexander Reyna,Anne Arden McDonald,Carter Hodgkin,david gibson,Elissa Levy,Jeanne Tremel,Jonathan Feldschuh,Madora Frey,Michael Zansky,The Active Space,the quantum effect,Thomas Frontini","

Music,"Hey cool kids! Want the rub on some great new music? Then please click elsewhere because the following words are about Green Jellÿ, the worst fucking band in the world. On the other hand, if you’re someone who’s keen to remember Green Jellÿ as that freaky speck in the crud-mosaic of a childhood that you sucked out of the brightly flashing televised slush of 1990s corporate sponsored child hypnosis, then you might realize, like I did last month in Bushwick, that a raging bald man in his underwear and an army of shitty neon puppet costumes might actually blow your mind.,For those of you who don’t remember Green Jellÿ, let’s set the stage. In 1993, America was getting ready for the Hootie jock rock tidal wave of 1994, and spent the year accordingly, listening to lots of that mumbly Spin Doctors song that goes , Somehow, in the midst of that widespread leveling and banality in rock, veteran Bufallo punk outfit Green Jellÿ coaxed BMG subsidiary Zoo Entertainment to front them $50,000 to create an “all video” album tastefully titled ,. Despite blowing most of the money on parties, Green Jellÿ managed to scrape together some videos. Among them was a claymation rendition of , a jokey heavy metal take on the ubiquitous folk tale. In 1992, Seattle radio station KXRX played “Three Little Pigs” as a joke and shortly thereafter the song became a regional hit, later invading “The Box” (a late night pay-per-play cable TV network), and finally landing on MTV’s Headbanger’s Ball, at which point it got lodged in the public consciousness through the summer of 1993.,But it would be a discredit to contain Green Jellÿ to that flash of mainstream fame. The band was originally formed in Buffalo, NY in 1981 by head honcho Bill Manspeaker as an attempt to create the world’s worst band (their name was inspired by the worst possible flavor of Jello). Early on, the band earned a reputation for throwing rowdy shows, destroying venues, and generally soiling audiences with ice cream sandwich food fights. Their quest to be the worst was highly successful. It prompted a superlative testimonial from Joey Ramone, who, after a 1984 show at Buffalo State College in which fans slathered the stage with trash bags full of green Jello and whipped cream, called Green Jellÿ the worst (and messiest) band that ever opened for The Ramones. They also got their first shot at national exposure when they appeared on ,, and managed to get gonged seconds after a pumpkin masked Manspeaker started writhing and singing.,The journey of the world’s worst band got even freakier when it was injected with the dump truck full of money they made from ,. From his Hollywood bunker, Manspeaker set out to build an underground arts colony that housed, “some of the greatest musical talent, and graffiti artists that Hollywood had to offer.” The buzz of the hive ultimately led him to get involved in the underground rave scene of the mid ’90s. Of that story and its road back to Jellÿ-dom, Manspeaker says in his ALL CAPS myspace bio/manifesto:,“THIS IS WHEN I DISCOVERED THE ELECTRONIC MUSIC SCENE…THIS WAS A EASY WAY OF PRODUCING MONEY DOING UNDERGROUND RAVE EVENTS…..LIKE LEMMINGS THEY CAME TO HEAR PEOPLE PLAY RECORD THAT SEEMED JUST TO SKIP OVER AND OVER AGAIN…THIS LED ME TO OPEN MY OWN 20,000 SQ FT 1500 PERSON RAVE CLUB CALLED QTOPIA HOLLYWOOD….OH BOY….SEX DRUGS AND RAVE N ROLL WAS RIGHT…THAT SOON GOT OUT OF CONTROL AS YOU COULD IMAGINE…AND THEN ONE DAY I WOKE UP WITH A HANG OVER AND SEVERAL NAKED GIRLS KISSING AND I SAID TO MYSELF…DUH SILLY MONKEY DONT YOU REMEMBER THAT YOU PUT ON SILLY PUPPET COSTUMES AND SHITTY ALBUMS FOR A LIVING!”,To tie it all together, here are some other weird and less narrative factoids about Green Jellÿ:,Flash forward to the present: I agreed to do a write up of the Green Jellÿ show for Bushwick Daily before I had a sense of what became of the band. I was researching shows at The Paper Box and was honestly shocked to see Green Jellÿ listed. I did a search to make sure it was the band I thought, a fact that was pretty instantly confirmed by the aforementioned manifesto, which was pasted in the show description. Perhaps I was inspired by the potential for oddity, or perhaps by my own childhood self, sitting in front of the TV waiting for the the Pigs video to come on so I could play air guitar and bang my little head.,By the time I get to The Paper Box that night I’m pretty stoned and thus exceptionally hypnotized by the newness of the room, and by the bassy warmth of The Red Hot Chili Pepper’s “Under the Bridge” pumping out over the speakers. There’s a nostalgic atmosphere, and I feel like I’m at a reunion for the 1990s, as if it were some school that I’d attended with the handful of other people in the room. Behind the white “sort of nice” lights of the bar at The Paper Box was a classic American looking blonde girl. She’d just put up a sign that said, “Jello Shots $2.” Green, of course. Feeling a bit like a creepy Green Jellÿ fan boy, I quickly slurped down a couple of the gooey shots, and the edges of my perception melt away.,Before the set begins, Manspeaker takes the stage by himself to deliver a salty soliloquy. He looks like Mr. Clean with thick rimmed glasses, and he has a cadence like Henry Rollins, speaking in a voice that somehow translates all speech into yelling. Plus he’s got a heckler’s soul, like he spent some time as a State Fair insult clown, and as he warms up the slightly populated audience he pulls a handful of people out of the crowd and dresses them up in a myriad of (disgusting?) multicolored puppet heads.,In moments, the music starts and I’m transported. I live in Bushwick and it’s 2013 so I don’t hear music like this very often. Punky, thrash metal riffs make for good puppet head banging. By the second song, , for which Manspeaker dons a full cow costume with demonic, light up eyeballs, I’m pretty fucking stoked to be where I am. We’re a long way from having enough people who are down for a mosh pit, though one of the long haired, leather jacketed crust nerds is starting to jostle around with some teens who probably came to see the opening band.,Maybe it was the steady stream of jello shots I stuffed in my gut, but everything about the show, the puppets, the lights, the headbanger riffs, all start to create a carnival atmosphere. In the shadow of Manspeaker’s enthusiasm, the band fades. The music becomes secondary to the constant flow of people he pulls on and off the stage, to the harsh rants, friendly insults, and ever present audience chanting at his lead “Green Jello SUCKS! Green Jello SUCKS!” (even the worst band in the world needs reassurance, apparently).,Pistols loaded; Bottoms up!","Matthew Sanders started hating music in 2010.

Mind and Body,"Do you know the power of ritual? The modern age has given us lots of cool and useful new tools, like penicillin and the internet, but in the moment when industrialization occurred, a priceless social technology was buried: the Ritual. It’s time for us, contemporary dwellers to get off our hamster wheels and tap back into the power of ritual.,Rituals are so powerful because they are experiential. They speak to your being through all of your senses. Rituals cause you to feel, and be present in the physical world. Rituals communicate directly with the living, breathing, feeling, wise, intelligent, intuitive part of you; and in doing so, accelerate the change; even for, and especially for modern day people like you and me. The rituals work because they center you in your intention, in your body, and in your power.,As a Ritual Designer, I invite you to start the year by taking inventory of your rituals.,According to Merriam Webster Dictionary, Ritual is defined as:,1: of or relating to rites or a ritual : ceremonial (e.g. a ritual dance); 2: according to religious law (e.g. ritual purity); 3: done in accordance with social custom or normal protocol (e.g. ritual handshakes or ritual background checks).,For the purpose of this article, Ritual also has a 3-step definition:,1. Design of an activity with intention; 2. Implementing and Executing that design; 3. Taking note of the change you create.,Take honest inventory of what rituals you have in place right now. What do they do for you? Rituals are a how you experience the world and how the world experiences you using your body as your creative instrument in the present moment. Its sort of like your body is your pen or your paintbrush. I challenge you to start right now – write out exactly the life you want most; start drawing, start painting. Don’t leave it to vision boards and don’t leave it to strategy of the mind, because calling in what you want most doesn’t work that way. We activate and bring in the new with our doing, with our activity, with our bodies.","Emily Tepper is Ritual Designer & Owner, Bushwick Pilates.","Emily Tepper,rituals,the ritualist","

"Featured,Music","Last week we had the pleasure of checking out the new and improved DIY venue,. Silent Barn’s old location in Ridgewood – at 915 Wyckoff Ave – was robbed (of more than $15,000 worth of equipment), vandalized, and eventually, abandoned. But, dry your years-old weeping- , is back to stay. Their new space, funded by a $40,000 incredible , effort, is a Bushwick 3-story apartment building with a sprawling first-floor venue space and a whole lotta love going around.,Silent Barn encompasses a community of artists and musicians living in communal apartment and venue space. Their youth-empowering mission (laid out in a , on their website) encourages people to create great things, experience great music, and share greatness with others. In their own words, it’s a living experiment in expression:,Fantastic!,These pictures give you a good idea of the vast space that the new SB offers. The venue itself takes over the entire floor – two huge rooms – with an entry to a large yard. The yard is currently full of gravel and the walls are fairly blank, but knowing the creative creatures that run the space, they’ll soon be smothered in graffiti, painting, showbills and handprints.,They’ve worked long and hard to procure and operate their new space legally so, until their liquor license is official, they’re selling virgin drinks only. Following are some images of the second and third floors of the building – art installations (,anyone?), bands, and some attractive party-goers….,Silent Barn’s, is chocked full of shows- almost every night of the week you can stroll over to Bushwick Ave and have yourself a house party and concert all in one. Last week I attended the Barn’s ,, hosted in the “Champagne Room” in the third floor’s living room. Performing was ,, an experimental noise artist, who “plays vinyl in every way it’s not supposed to be played.” She created a sound atmosphere by dragging the needle across fragments and slivers of different records- from Latin to spoken word- to create more-or-less predictable avante-garde noise series. The sound that came out was both wispy and blaring, sometimes pleasant, sometimes less so, but in SB style, it was an interesting performance.,Last was punk/noise band Cum Blood (yes, you read that right), which features ,‘s Nyssa on the mic. Not much to say about their music – it fits the sometimes abrasive mission of Silent Barn’s experimental policies or the lack thereof. Their music is loud and full of angst, and they put on a great live show.,Make your way over to Silent Barn and expand your airwaves, social network, and Bushwick credibility!

"Arts and Culture,Featured","We spotted Frankie the Dog on Friday night in front of ,. He was appreciating the warmth of the outdoor heater, in a subtle way only a Maltese can: he stuck his pink tongue out, and tilted his head to the right. His owner and a friend Chris Harding, from the , gallery, was nonchalantly discussing art with a couple of friends while Frankie was already planning our route for the night of gallery hopping.,“, was a dog lover and had three Maltese dogs!” Chris proudly petted Frankie on his patient, shaggy head. Frankie’s heritage has clearly destined him for the great career of a gallery dog. He has developed a fine taste in art, and has never barked without good reason. When he did occasionally bark, you could hear the gentle English accent and diction in his voice. Even though Frankie was not particularly fond of the hordes of people walking between the Bushwick art spaces on this Friday night, he was clearly an established admirer of arts and knew he was doing this for a higher, noble cause.,At ,, Frankie admired the courage of gallerist Deborah Brown to entrust her space to ,. Yes, this young installation artist and sculptor petted Frankie gently on the head, so he might as well receive a good review. Frankie enjoyed stepping onto the soft, black carpet that was covering the usually cold, tiled floor. The carpet was meant to accommodate - not exactly Frankie but – the tall rectangular, shower-like mirror object placed in the middle of the gallery. Everybody was pointing to a classical landscape painting by Viola Minasian of Griffith Observatory reflecting in the mirror rectangular. Frankie knew it was for the contrast between the classical peacefulness and the masculinity of the mirrored object dominating the room. He didn’t know what all the fuss was about, but he liked his own reflection. He left a nose and breath mark in the lower part of the object as an addition to the gestural finger prints and marks in the upper part. Additionally, there was a piece hanging in the next room containing a folded, checkered flag in a triangular shape. Unfortunately, it was hanging too high for Frankie to properly see it and provide a well-informed Maltese judgement. Well, Storefront Bushwick, next time hang your art lower, so that a Maltese can appreciate your art as well!,On the way to , at 56 Bogart, someone leaned over to Chris and said, “It’s one of the boring conceptual shows, “ while he took a hasty sip from his Jim Beam flask. Frankie politely waited for Chris but knew he would not be deprived of an artistic experience. Arriving at NURTUREart was a little scary for the Maltese. The crowd was so thick you could barely see any art. Chris had to hold him in his arms in order to prevent anyone from accidentally stepping on the art-loving creature. Frankie realized very quickly that he would need Chris to take him on another trip to fully grasp the meaning of  ,. Frankie understood that the group art show (Lisha Bai, Leah Beeferman, Ethan Greenbaum, Elisa Lendvay, Demetrius Oliver, Allyson Vieira, and Joe Winter) was discussing our relationship with the Universe and the concept of limited time before the World ends. Frankie shrugged in the memory of December 21. Luckily, the Mayans were wrong this time!,A redheaded lady who smelled like a cat approached Frankie and squeaked while touching his ears. “Awww, what a happy doggie!” Frankie didn’t like the cat smell too much. He was quite happy when his friend Chris saved him and told the cat lady that Maltese dogs don’t show their feelings on their faces. “When he’s happy, he sticks out his tongue.” Frankie’s tongue was nowhere to be seen. It was time to move on to the next gallery.,Trotting by Chris’ side on the walk between the warehouses, Frankie enjoyed the company and wit of Paul D’Agostino. This fella would always give him nice decent petting and add a good anecdote. Frankie also liked Don Pablo Pedro, whom they ran into earlier that night for his bold fashion choices and dog-loving approach. The final destination of the night was ,, a gallery of Jen Hitchings at ,. Frankie hadn’t met Jen yet, but was looking forward to the the exhibition of hilarious art she has prepared - especially after the serious subject of the End of the World., at Weeknights made Frankie – almost – stick his tongue out in joy. As he walked into the crowded gallery, he could hear the laughter of Theresa Daddezio, both live and from a recording. Theresa’s laughing piece included 1 hour and 40 minutes of pretty natural sounding laughter. Other pieces were as funny as promised and Frankie felt good to see a lighthearted optimistic show like this. After two cups of Trader Joe’s wine, lots of petting and even more art seen around Bushwick, both Frankie and Chris were ready to go home. After all, no art could ever beat the gigantic painting of , exhibited at English Kills…., , , , , ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

In the Hood,"I love answering questions here, but sometimes you get some that you can’t believe are real. Are they? Who cares if they’re worth thinking about! Here are some good ones. Let me know if you think they’re real or fake. And yes, I know it’s annoying and feels manipulative that I put the word “handjobs” in the headline, but I work hard on this stuff and I want to make sure that you to read it.

There are certainly men out there who may specifically enjoy a handjob and it’s good if you are willing to give it to them. Also, the word handjob has the word “job” in it, so I don’t see any reason why you can’t get paid if you wish to.,In my own experience, I have not been asked for a handjob since I was 14 and in a car with a 16 year old. Above all else, you are always free to say no to any sex act you dislike or find to be too much work., ,—Fed Up,. Dear Fed Up: First of all, the police are too busy guarding the L train stations to give out fines for this. But haven’t you ever heard of citizen’s arrest? I think you should quit your day job and spend your time watching for people who don’t pick up the shit. Wear an authoritative uniform of your own design and give the offenders a ticket. Have someone videotape the ensuing altercations you will have with the lousy dog owners. The golden combination of the videos of your tension-filled arrests, sculptures you can make out of dog shit, plus being able to say you’re an artist from Bushwick, should give you a blue-chip art career.

You could have looked that up just as easily as I did, but I think you may have wanted to get some attention and feel smart for knowing enough to ask the question. It seems to me you may have some need for recognition that you may not be getting. The other possibility is that you may be getting some ridiculous sexual thrill of having smegma discussed here. Think about all that and get back to me with a real question about your unfulfilled needs., —Social Shopper, Dear Social Shopper: Money. Plain and simple. The management at Whole Foods puts pressure on people to get them in and out of the store as fast as possible since they have a big operation to run. “No screwing around!” they say. At Brooklyn Natural, they give a shit about the relationships that the staff has with the customers since we see one another all the time. I’m sure it must be nicer to work at Brooklyn Natural than Whole Foods in Manhattan, but nevertheless those are real jobs, the kind that artists should be prepared to do once they get their MFAs., —Sidney, Dear Sidney: Yes.

"Featured,In the Hood","Photographer , gleefully transported everyone back to the past at a tiny Dominican joint the other day. The fluorescent humanity of her 1984 homage to Edward Hopper (see above) merged with the subtle sweetness of fried plantains at ,over by the Myrtle-Wyckoff station.,Meryl, 61, reminisced over lunch about how her job as an art teacher at Bushwick’s IS-291 helped her capture the arresting images of resilience amid rough circumstances for which she is known.,“Looking back, I’m very conscious of the fact that I was doing positive reinforcement,” she said. “I was photographing things I found uplifting.”,
The picture she shot 28 years ago of Cibao (SEE-bow) Restaurant was first published in the Brooklyn Historical Society’s 2007 exhibition “,,” which documented Bushwick’s recovery from the devastation of arson and blight. Meryl and others who witnessed the rise of Bushwick reference its improvement even as they caution that new developments threaten the neighborhood’s identity.,“There’s less money, but it’s better,” said Victor Rodriguez, the owner of Cibao Restaurant, about how the neighborhood’s changes have affected his restaurant. “You don’t get robbed as much. They used to shoot at you just to see you jump.”,Rodriguez, 42, has cut staff and spends most days fixing equipment at his restaurant while two of his sisters-in-law and his brother help customers.,Rodriguez has owned Cibao since 1996, and he said he plans to put up Meisler’s picture of his restaurant’s old location in the Myrtle-Wyckoff JMZ stop on the wall. He wore an amused expression as Meryl conducted her normal m.o. of photographing everyone in sight.,The curly-haired brunette lady with an aura of compassion snapped shots of the whole restaurant this time.,Meryl became connected to Bushwick during her 14 years teaching at Roland Hayes I.S. 291 and the now defunct Rosa T. Weatherless Alternative School. She said she was shocked at the condition of the neighborhood when she started teaching in Bushwick in 1981.,“It looked like the aftermath of a war zone,” she said. “It looked like a bombed out place.” The school’s campus overlooked the remains of houses destroyed in Bushwick’s , and the accompanying blackout.,The scarred neighborhood became her passion before it was hip.,“I think Bushwick’s a very friendly, open, warm place,” Meryl said. “I feel very welcomed here.” She added that she often runs into former students.,
The man sitting at the next table overheard us talking about how Bushwick used to be and took an interest, so Rodriguez showed John Moreira the picture.,They got to talking and realized that Meisler had been John’s art teacher in the early ‘80s. John Moreira, 44, the owner of the New Ridgewood Car Service next door, said Cibao Restaurant “makes me think of old times, when I was a kid.”,John started grabbing take out from Cibao on his way to and from the subway in the early ‘80s when the little place opened in its original location. He was 16 when the photo was taken, probably just a little bit younger than the young fellow in Meisler’s composition. Meryl commented that she hoped someone would recognize the guy from her picture the next time she visited.,Longtime residents like Moreira stop into Cibao for cheap traditional fare like rice and beans, , (stuffed fried plantains in chicken broth) and , (tripe soup). People know the food so well that they rarely check the menu.,The trip down memory lane led both Meryl and Moreira to the surreal elements of their school.  Meryl and John laughed as they reminisced about the teacher who counseled Meryl to throw a chair across the room to intimidate the students, and another teacher who dressed in his Vietnam fatigues and boots on the first day of classes to let the restless youth know who was in command.,But Moreira said teachers like Meryl inspired a bond with the students instead of scaring them.,“The good teachers always had the good students who would respect them,” he said. “We were motivated, we would protect them.”,All the talk of Bushwick’s past led people at the restaurant to talk of the future. Moreira voiced concern that he never sees the families he grew up around in Bushwick.,“Up to two years ago, we used to go back to our old block,” Moreira said. “But now everyone’s gone because they’ve been pushed out.”,Bushwick is still 65 percent Latino and 8.5 percent white overall according to the latest ,, though the “white non-Hispanic” population grew by almost 6 percentage points between 2000 and 2010.,“In the long run, as long as affordable housing legislation honors and protects people who live here, I think an economically and ethnically diverse neighborhood is a healthy one,” Meryl had said to me at an earlier time. On this day at Cibao, she said it with her pictures. She left several prints of her Cibao picture at the restaurant and returned the following week for lunch., ","Journalism student at CUNY Graduate School of Journalism covering the Bushwick, Brooklyn beat for the NY City NewsService.

"Featured,Opinion","I love you, Bushwick, but I have some complaints. This neighborhood, so creative, friendly, so densely populated and diverse, desperately , ,.,Take a moment and stand on the corner of Myrtle-Broadway on any given day for five minutes. You will see plenty of ostensibly queer people and their allies, ready to bend the boundaries of gender and express themselves bravely. However, these fellow Bushwick queers don’t stay around town, they are merely get on the JMZ trains and leave for Williamsburg, the Lower East Side,  or the East Village. Yet, all of them are more than willing to proudly disclose their status as residents of Bushwick and elaborate on the same quaint features I’ve listed above. When they get home after a night out, they run from the train to their apartments like soldiers jumping from the fox hole to the bunker, and I can’t blame them, really.,If I counted, instead of sheep, the number of times I have heard “Maricon” (the spanish word for “faggot”) on the two block walk from subway to my house, I would probably put myself to sleep.,Some of my friends have revealed to me that they are bisexual or queer, and yet they prefer to date the opposite sex in Bushwick because of their social scene. Really, people? I came to New York to ESCAPE that sort of sexuality policing.,Most importantly, Bushwick is significantly lacking organized resources, nightlife, or events catering to LGBTQ people. Sure, most of the people here claim to be liberal and accepting, but I find myself the token queer almost all of the time I try to hang out with my friends. For most of us singles, gay or straight, having absolutely no one to flirt with can be a downer. With all of that said, it’s no surprise to me that Bushwick queers are heading to Sugarland, Metropolitan, and the recently opened This ‘N That in Williamsburg, rather than trying to navigate the chaotic mix of acceptance and heterobias that comprises the Bushwick social scene.,Despite that I’ve tried to compile a, very, very, very short list of some of the more queer friendly venues in the Bushwick area:,This East Williamsburg venue has a Monday night queer party thrown by the talented, gender fucking queen named Mason King. The name of the party is Bath Salts, with various weekly sub themes.,Tandem has been named by many of my friends as the “unofficial” gay bar in Bushwick. Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays have all been cited as the most queer, though I’m guessing it really depends on who decides to go in. Tuesdays are a regular queer night; , are a monthly lesbian dance party held on Tuesdays and Invocation is a monthly gay party on Thursdays. However, these events lack promotion in order to really grow as events dedicated to queer audience.,Wreck Room on 940 Flushing Ave is organizing a weekly , that is supposed to be a lesbian night but it brings in a large straight punk/indie crowd.,Last Thursdays of the month belong to a pop-up performance party ,. This lesbian table dancing party collective was last spotted at King’s County Bar.,And…. that’s about it. I could add queer friendly , on 101 Wilson, because the owners and bartenders bring in a pretty heavy LGBTQ crew every time I’m there, but, again, everything is unofficial.,While it may seem great, in a sense, that everything is so accepting and unofficial and that gay people can comfortably hang with their straight counterparts without fear of hatred or violence, I would have to say that this air of assimilation is a bit premature. Many of the implants in Bushwick aren’t from liberal areas, and not everyone who lives here is as accepting as one might think. As you can discern from my anecdote about the Bisexuals that consciously avoid same-sex attraction in Bushwick, there’s still a lot of heterobias here and a lot of over-saturation from definitively straight musicians, straight artists, and straight people of all sorts. In short, Bushwick NEEDS a centralizing queer scene or force in the area that reaffirms our position and part in creating what has become one of the most vibrant parts of Brooklyn.,How do you feel being a queer in Bushwick? If you know of more LGBTQ friendly events and places, please leave us a comment below., ","Writer, I guess, Bartender, and Music and Kitten lover.

"Featured,Food and Drink","Inspired by the Spanish bar culture, Ben Warren and Gina Leone who own ,, have spawned another bar called ,.  The name Heavy Woods is a play on the Dutch word, ,, which later was Anglicized to Bushwick. The new space serves a full bar, unlike its older sister, and as of December 2012, began to serve Chef Simon Glenn’s d.b.a popular pop-up, New Orleans style BBQ, Tchoup Shop. The food will be served from Wednesday through Sunday with expectations that it will be nightly in 2013.,In addition to the food and the full bar, Heavy Woods opens up at 7:30AM to serve coffee and morning pastries for the arduous workers. Café Grumpy Bklyn provides the coffee, and the pastries are made with love from ,. They serve coffee until 5PM until Heavy Woods turns into a drinkers paradise.,As food lovers, we are psyched about the menu. Hot dishes like duck and okra Gumbo and crispy chicken biscuit, and bar snacks like the crab and okra hush puppies and the very adventurous pork tongue crostini.  Yes, we know that we’re not being very vegetarian friendly in describing some of the food, but there are great options for you meatless eaters too. The deviled eggs, appropriately named “Awesome Devil Eggs” and Potato Mortadella Salad, are both great vegetarian options.,Tchoup Shop got its name from ,, a large and well-known street along the Mississippi River in New Orleans, which is named after an extinct American Indian tribe who settled in the area.,The menu is an artisanal take on traditional New Orleans cuisine. We ordered a bunch of Tchoup Shop ‘s “Hot Thing” specialties: ,. The food was flavorful, but it lacked the New Orleans spice. With each spoonful of the gumbo you got a taste of what was inside of it. The chicken biscuit was very delicious and sweet. According to the Heavy Woods menu, it’s covered in Pepper Jelly - which I didn’t taste but it was definitely coated in something sticky and sweet (and… what’s wrong with sweet and sticky?). The Catfish Po’ Boy sandwich with green onion mayo is highly recommended to try. Served on a hero, the catfish was fried to perfection and the green onion mayo was a great alternative to the traditional remoulade that normally accompanies a Po’ Boy Sandwich.,If you’re into tapas while drinking, you will love the “Bar Snacks.”, are perfect for sharing. The Crab and Okra Hush Puppies had a nice jalapeño remoulade. Take your first bite of the soft puppies, and you’ll get a lump of crabmeat and a chunk of okra. Don’t forget to dip it in the remoulade! The boudin balls, made of duck liver, are soft morsels of deliciousness for the adventurous eater. If you’re a fan of crispy and pork, try the Pork Cracklin’s. All of these eclectic dishes are relatively inexpensive — the prices range from $3 to $12 per dish.,If you’re not big into eating right now, we get it. It’s the new year and you’re on a liquid diet. The great news is that Heavy Woods has an amazing seasonal cocktails selection. The , is made with beet and dill infused vodka, vermouth, and a rosemary garnish. On a cold day, try a , for some great buzz of a mid-winters drink. Or the ,made with red wine and spices. Additionally, they have fourteen craft beers available.,The resemblance between The Bodega and its younger sister Heavy Woods is uncanny with the great and helpful staff and amazing beers on draft. In addition, you will surely appreciate  how eclectic and fearless Heavy Woods is when it comes to experimenting between countries., ,Correction: The author  mistakenly reported that the Potato and mortadella was a vegetarian option.

"Featured,Mind and Body","The first class of Bushwick-trained yoga teachers walked happily out of , studio only a couple of weeks ago. The fresh yoga teachers were raving about their 6 months of training, their teacher Ella Luckett and how it changed their lives so much. We had to look at Jai Yoga Arts in Bushwick a little closer., Jai Yoga Arts is a yoga studio located off Morgan stop at 47 Thames St. Unlike traditional yoga studios in the area where you can only practice yoga, at Jai you can also become a Yoga Alliance Certified teacher. The studio and its programming are the brainchild of Ella Luckett, a former dancer and a yoga teacher of more than 10 years. In 2012, Ella surrounded herself with the Universal forces and good people like her business partner Emily Snyder to open a studio in a loft space in her home Bushwick.  Ella lovingly ponders the story of Jai and its beginnings, a studio created on almost a zero budget: “We went to Ikea’s reject area and picked all the discounted stuff. Things started to happen very fast!” Today Jai is one of the most successful yoga studios in the area, frequently attended by locals seeking peace of mind, spiritual enlightenment and community. “We wanted to create a place where people can also hang out after the class and get to know the neighbors,” says Ella. “We serve tea after each class and encourage people to hang out here on the couch,” Ella smiles.,, and Jai is still accepting applications to fill the small class of 20 students. If you feel the calling to become a yoga teacher or simply want to deepen your practice, you have a great chance to do so, right here in Bushwick! During the six months of training, you will meet with Ella three times a week (Tuesday, Thursday from 7AM to 8:30AM and on Sundays 10AM-6:30PM) and You will learn all you need to know about Anatomy, Sanskrit, Yoga Sutras, Yoga Philosophy, Teaching Technique, Ayurveda, Business of yoga, and more. A 3-day Ashram Retreat concludes the course.,During and after the training, your life is likely to change dramatically. We asked about the experience and the best moments of one of the recently graduated yoga teachers, Sarah Lowndes (you probably know Sarah as one of the organizers of Bushwick Open Studios). She said, “The teacher training program at Jai was absolutely life changing. Ella is an amazing teacher, a truly inspiring human being. She created this really safe space for us to explore ourselves–our bodies, our minds and our spirits–and embrace everything. It opened me up in so many ways. This probably sounds so hippy-dippy, but it’s true: I feel so much more LOVE!” says Sarah.,“It was seriously a reality shift. There were times when I’d feel like I was going crazy because things were changing so much, like the way I related to the people around me, my day-to-day experiences.” About her plans for the future, Sarah says: “I want to continue learning and teaching; maybe quitting my job and teaching as I travel. It was so good! I’m so grateful for Jai and Ella and the people who shared the experience with me. It’s a whole new world!”, ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily. She can easily be moved by reflection of the sky in a puddle.

A glance at , made me scream a little, and when I took a closer look I was screaming for sure. Apologies to my cats and neighbors but this weekend will be EPIC! With Art Basel Miami and Holidays in December, we haven’t seen too many art openings lately. Well, cry no more! Friday will be a big night for art, so have an extra cup of coffee before you go out! After you’re done with all the openings, we suggest some dancing to keep you warm! And not just any dancing, but some proper Bushwick wilderness… Are you ready? Let’s go!, ,The legends about the , sculptures made of foam, bungee rope and donuts have been circulating far beyond Bushwick for the longest time after Bushwick Basel during BOS 2012. The craze about Adam Parker Smith, an artist whose medium is everything, is rightfully hysterical. The butts are not the only type of art Adam makes; in fact the only thing his pieces have in common is that grin you will surely find on your face. Guys, this Friday, whether you love or hate art, Adam Parker Smith is a must see!, ,At NURTUREart  they are reflecting on recent apocalyptic predictions and the way they shifted the universe. A group of artists (Lisha Bai, Leah Beeferman, Ethan Greenbaum, Elisa Lendvay, Demetrius Oliver, Allyson Vieira, and Joe Winter) address cosmological hierarchy through their experimental studio practice.,, we wrote about Outlet Fine Art and how much we love this easy-flow Bushwick gallery. Their current show, , is closing this Friday, and you should not miss the chance to see some really good sampling of urban and street art (A City of Children, Jilly Ballistic, El Sol 25, Jason Eppink, John Redmann, Jowy Romano, Matthew Silver, Enrico Miguel Thomas) Also they have a raffle!, ,Similarly to Outlet Fine Art, also Jen Hitchings and her gallery Weeknights belongs to the young and awesome generation of Bushwick gallerists. On Friday night, go check out a big group show of hilarious art. We can’t wait!, ,Brooklyn Wayfarers is an artists studio building and a gallery space. Their tradition is to do openings on Sunday nights, which works pretty well with the always art-crowded Bushwick Fridays. Go check out the solo show of David (scout) McQueen who will present a series of re-imagined works of Vincenzo Gamba (Galilei), the illegitimate son of Galileo Galilei., ,Albeit not during the weekend, and that is not during the weekend even with my loose European interpretation of it, Microscope Gallery has a very interesting event on Monday. “now what,” is a night of screening and moving image performance curated from an international open call. The three programs include: a wide-range of mostly new and recent works from established to emerging artists working with Super 8mm or 16mm film, digital video, video games, appropriated footage (from Youtube, Google & other sources), music video, performance and more. Look also forward to five live projection performances, live sound, multiple projectors, and dance. The event is taking place at Running Rebel Studios, neighbors to Microscope Gallery., , ,After a TON of expectations, it is here. Missed for a long time, Silent Barn has finally opened its gates! Tonight they are inviting us all to the first apartment show with bands, bday party and maybe-bacon., ,Bossa Nova Civic Club is a brand new unique night and dance club right on Myrtle Ave. Co-owned by a veteran of the rave scene, John Barclay, Bossa Nova won’t bring anything else the a full night out experience with vinyls, DJs and dancing.,Here at Bushwick Daily nothing makes us happier than to discover a new DIY venue. Blackhole on 53 Wilson seems to be one of them. Go check it out on Saturday for “NEW TECHNO HOUSE WAVE FUNK MACHINE DIGITAL VIDEO WAX.”,Fitness Gallery is a new storefront gallery on Myrtle Ave across the street from Little Skips. On Saturday they have an interesting durational music performance going on. They will bring to life Richard Kamerman’s epic composition “MODULAR SYSTEM FOR 1 to 6 MUSICIANS.” During the 13 hours of performance, they expect many interesting occasional guests to show up. So show up too and dance in the street with them., ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily. She can easily be moved by reflection of the sky in a puddle.

"Arts and Culture,Featured","There is no designated stage area, blurring the line between audience and performer, and seating is sparse, as participating in the performance is encouraged. The unknown terrifies you, and yet something, maybe this very feeling, pushes you inside. Welcome to ,.,I consider myself to have a fairly open and high tolerance for the unimaginable, the uncomfortable, the unexplainable, and the bizarre art movements that make this city so unique. That being said, my experience at Grace Space was like no other.,At Grace Space, I have seen a beautiful and moving recreation of a traditional Korean funeral, a piece that made me question the definition of beauty and affection, and a piece that made me laugh about our societies importance on “goals” and dreams that was demonstrated through the smashing of eggs. However, at Grace Space I have also seen, in the name of art, a woman urinate in her pants in front of a room full of at least 70 people. I have smelled things burn that I never want to smell again, and I have dodged more than one dildo fight. I’ve seen a man eat dirt, a woman light her clothes on fire, a man shoot a laser pointer out of his behind, multiple people get physically branded (like cattle!) and more flaccid penises than I care to see ever again. When I tell friends of my experience, they ask me “Why?” “What’s the point?” “You’re telling me that’s art?” And the truth is, while all of those bizarre events made me uncomfortable, the fact that I couldn’t answer these questions, that I couldn’t put words on what I had seen, scared me most of all. And that’s why I went back. And back again. And back again. And back again.,Grace Exhibition Space is a venue located in a big loft space on Broadway (that is the Bushwick Broadway) dedicated to hosting performance artists or performance art groups, and sharing an accessible and regular performance art schedule with Bushwick. The space opened in 2006, and draws crowds of 80 to 100 people each weekend.,The space came to be because Jill McDermid-Hokanson who co-directs the space with her husband, Erik Hokanson, simply wanted to see more performance art, something she studied at the University of Iowa. She realized if she wanted to see it in Brooklyn, she would have to put the events together herself, which was clearly no easy feat, as she describes the process of submerging herself into the community and finding groups to bring to Brooklyn to perform.,“I would get invited to festivals and find a way to go, and I would feel really renewed each time about this really cool art form.” Jill said, and went on to explain she made friends with the performance art communities around the world, which is how she gets the opportunity to know and pick artists she would like to bring over, granted they got the funding. She went on to describe this community’s norms and customs. Among performance art festivals and events, when you travel to see work the community takes care of you. They help you find a place to stay, make sure you can get around by teaching you the transportation, see that you’re fed, etc. The process and devotion for the form and for the people involved goes even further. “What you see on Friday night, the artists would have arrived a week earlier and they spend a whole week being in the space, looking for materials, eating together, setting up the work, trying to put the word out, and then we do it all over again,” Jill clarified.,After realizing that some of the spaces were hard to confirm, or not accommodating to the kinds of space and work her performance art groups were comfortable with, she locked down a permanent home for Grace Exhibition Space near her residence, at it’s current home of 840 Broadway.,“We’re working on becoming a non profit and are working on getting some grants in the future,” Jill said, struggling to sum up what the space is all about (and we can’t blame her!) “But in the meantime it’s a pretty low budget thing so it’s just about showing respect to each other. It’s a really beautiful international network.”,While Grace Space seems to be a revolving international door of a number of different performance groups from around the globe, we can look at the space as a whole through the group ,. During October and November of 2012, Grace Exhibition Space hosted the “NON GRATA” series, a series of performance art events curated by member and performer of the NON GRATA group, Al Paldrok. “NON GRATA is an international performance group from Estonia with a floating membership.” Paldrok defines in for Bushwick Daily. “In NON GRATA there have been more than 500 members during last 15 years from all over the world. The main characteristics are anonymity within group work, ignorance of the local art world and mass media. The group has performed in Asia, Europe, South and North America with street actions, chaotic spaces, context specific performances and long lasting ghetto marathons.” Each Friday for the two months, NON GRATA drew crowds of local artists, writers, and other curious folk from around the city.,It seems natural to say a space that hosts events that are risky and daring can only exist in an area where there is a thriving artist community like Bushwick, Al made a great point about how artists shape a community and not the other way around:,“Grace Exhibition Space was here before this neighborhood came to be what it is now.” Al explained. “In 2006, when Grace Space opened with a NON GRATA exhibition and performances, the locals stopped us in front of the space and told us to go back to where we belong. Grace Exhibition Space is an independent art space and its true value is right there. These kinds of places form the environment in which they exist, not the other way around.”,“And while we agree the art does contribute to the shape of a neighborhood, there are benefits to having the space in Bushwick specifically,” explained Jill.,“Performance art can be political and sometimes there’s nudity because it’s all based on the body, and if you showed that kind of work [in Manhattan] you would lose your funding,” Jill said after referencing the infamous 1990 Karen Finley vs. the NEA case, where the artist was forced to send back her grant after her performance piece was considered “lude.”,“So you couldn’t present the work,” Jill continued, “and it kind of disappeared for a while and it’s starting to come back now. I think the thing about where we’re located is, we can be political and we can have some nudity and its not that shocking and it’s fine, but in Manhattan the liability insurance is much more expensive, and you have funders that you can’t offend, and I think it’s a lot harder when you’re dependent on that enormous amount of money to keep you going each month. It’s harder to take a risk. That’s the other nice thing about being where we are, in Bushwick.”,This is hardly a fair summation of the events that transpired in the two months I was exposed to Grace Space, and what I imagine it takes to put on a show. But as I continued to feel drawn to the spot, and as I got to know the welcoming regulars, characters, alternative art space owners, and artists, who make up the performance art scene in Bushwick and beyond, I realized it isn’t about how limitless, abstract, lawless or beautiful a performance can be. It’s about having a place to go as surely and regularly as you can attend a gallery opening every Thursday in Chelsea, for an (unfortunately) rare and unusual art form.,What I learned most about this community is that it’s a gift to have a space where one can be out of his or her comfort zone. While I realize everyone’s experience is different, and perhaps I may be in the minority here, I think it’s safe to say Grace Space plays home to truly unique art experience. I have found Grace Space to be a breath of fresh air, and a new way to see and experience feelings you may have not faced in a long time. It’s a place to let yourself be exposed, amused, delighted, and terrified all at the same time, and I can say I haven’t experienced this combination of emotions at any gallery or theater I have ever stepped into, and that’s a wonderful thing.,The space provides a refreshing perspective on an art scene that has been somewhat shackled and restrained for quite a bit of time now. Grace Exhibition Space is a brave pioneer as it puts Bushwick, as well as New York City, on the forefront of exploration and exposure into the minds and bodies of artists who are truly gifted, fearless, and unique.","On a mission to expose the NYC art scene for what it is - fun, inspiring and exciting!

"Featured,In the Hood","Bushwick is the neighborhood of many innovative ideas, hundreds of artists, a ton of new bars and well, of thousands of rats.  The good folks over at , put together an interactive map of NYC using the numbers of rat complaint phone calls to 311. And yes, Bushwick won! With 965 rat sightings Bushwick effortlessly won over neighboring competitors such as Bed-Stuy (626), East Williamsburg (431) and Ridgewood (542). The phone calls were places between 2010 and 2012, and if this was any other neighborhood, I would try to argue that the number of phone calls doesn’t necessarily mean that we have more rats that other neighborhoods. It can easily mean that people just complain more… But as I have experienced walks home down Dekalb Ave on a garbage night… (I would chose to walk on the road and rather be hit by a B38 bus than to walk on a sidewalk…) So I will say only one thing: GET A CAT!  [,]","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

"Arts and Culture,Featured","Young, fresh and hot is the art of, gallery. Located at 253 Wilson Avenue (a block from Myrtle), the gallery was , eight months ago by Julian Jimarez. With the intention of promoting creativity and under the seasonal name ,, the gallery began a series of frequently changing art shows and atypical workshops (e.g. make your own dumplings). The idea, which would likely give any branding specialist a heart attack, is to change the name of the gallery with the changing seasons. I mean, wouldn’t you prefer spending your time at Outlet Fine Art, as opposed to Sunset Surf Club when it’s barely 30 degrees outside?,However, the name isn’t the only thing that changed at the gallery. Curator and art entrepreneur Aliza Kelly joined Outlet as a co-owner in the Fall. The programming at the gallery has never been more fun! I checked out the opening of a group show titled ,in mid-December. On the Grid is a very easy-flowing sample of urban musings ranging from drawings on the MTA Subway map (,) to inconspicuously placed pieces of a street art hero, ,. After seeing the beautiful genderless figures in the street art of ,virtually everywhere in North Brooklyn, I was very excited to “meet” his art in a gallery space.,A feeling of familiarity emanates from the art on the walls, and it is very easy to relate to the art show, especially if you are someone who takes subway to work every day or simply walk the gritty streets of Bushwick…,At the opening of On the Grid, the gallery was packed with people who didn’t seem to be giving much thought to the simultaneously happening art fairs in Miami. An intense Bushwick performance artist , showed up at 8PM and cheered up the crowd with his performance ,., , ,If you missed the opening, you’ll have another chance to experience the flow of Outlet Fine Art , at the closing reception for On the Grid.

"Featured,Food and Drink","Good news, Bushwick! We’ve got an Asian fusion restaurant in the neighborhood now, and it’s well worth the distinction of being the first. , owners Christine and Ron Guillen opened , just across the street this past summer, where they’re serving up a lots of Eastern goodies on St. Nicholas.,Christine and Ron are both Filipinos – Christine moved to New York from the Philippines in 2007, though Ron grew up in Brooklyn – and have always wanted to bring some of the foods they grew up with to Bushwick. And while they don’t feature Filipino food on the evolving menu just yet, (they plan to in the near future) they got the idea for Bon from a sushi chef friend, deciding to offer delicacies from all sorts of Asian cuisines. “We love this neighborhood, and one of the things we really wanted here was a variety of foods,” Christine told us. “What we don’t have here is a lot of Asian cuisine, and we are from Asia, so we think it’s cool to have that in our neighborhood. When people talk about Asian food, they think it’s Chinese food, and there are a lot of countries in Asia.”,We got to sample a whole bunch of specialty dishes in Bon’s sweet, intimate space, starting with , ($11) and , ($5). The noodles were wonderfully hearty, and the gyoza, made from Ron’s family recipe, provided a complimentary savory crunch. Next, we tried one of Bon’s best treats, , ($4). The pork belly was perfectly cooked, lean and tender with just the right about of trimmed fat, and was paired well with the sweet bun. Finally, we sunk our teeth into Bon’s most popular dish, ,($12). The dish is so well-liked Christine told us it sold out the night before, and we can see why – like the pork belly sliders, the meat is satisfyingly super tender, and the added kick of the kimchi sauce emphasizes its natural salty flavor. We also tried some ,, ($3.5) made with the juice of lemons from the Philippines, and the drink was refreshing without suffering from overwhelming sweet or sour.,They also do brunch daily, though they are closed Sundays, offering typical American breakfast dishes with an Asian twist, like , ($9.50), , ($12) and , ($12). Bon! Asian Spice Cafe is still evolving – they plan to add more dishes to the menu over time, and hope to get a liquor license soon so they can serve Asian brews and sake.

"Featured,In the Hood","2012 was awesome, as we mentioned ,. Looking at the most popular stories of 2012 one has to come to the conclusion that our readers are mostly interested in big Bushwick topics such as the changes to the neighborhood; what it means to be part of a quickly changing neighborhood (and in naked women, , surprisingly…).  Bushwick Daily is primarily focused on arts and culture, however there were certain topics we felt we were obliged to inform about (such as a warning to women about attacks in Bushwick). Our mission and focus continue to be the celebration of good things and remarkable people of this neighborhood. Now let’s read through our most popular posts once again:,We believe that the moral of the story is that Facebook is a good servant but a bad master. Cops took down a huge 250-member violent gang from Bushwick thanks to creating fake profiles and friending younger gang members who had been bragging about their “achievments” on social networks. Also just the sole existence of such a gang in Bushwick is a good reality check for all the new comers who believe they live in a Bohemian heaven. Sure you do, but also you live in one of the most dangerous parts of the city, so don’t be oblivious to that…., ,Despite the lack of any official information from the NYPD, the Internet and the word of mouth has it that an unknown serial rapist has been attacking women around Morgan and Jefferson stops. We still don’t know whether it was one or more people and whether they were caught. At the 83rd Precinct they told us that we should always be careful and never walk alone, especially after dark, whether a woman or a man. It is important not to wear headphones and hoods when walking the streets and again be very aware that this is Bushwick and it is still dangerous., ,At some point of the year, all Bushwick Daily writers were really busy writing stories about new bars and restaurants that opened in Bushwick. In September, we counted 11 of them, and this number keeps growing… We say yes, it’s nice to have all these new bars and restaurants but does the community really need all of them?, ,Hurricane Sandy hit New York, but ,. We were really proud to see thousands of Bushwickians eager to , and to ,. We also organized a , and ,, raising almost $5,000 for the Sandy victims., ,Dear Bushwick opened in September on Wilson Ave, and attracted a lot of attention thanks to its delicious, hearty cuisine. Also the arrival of a (another) high end restaurant became a clear sign that Bushwick is becoming a foodie destination of New York City.,The huge number of people who read about Rachel and Kurt moving to Bushwick doesn’t mean that we are crazy about Glee. It means that Bushwick has become a part of the pop culture as the ultimate destination for the young and creative people who came to NYC to make it big. Whether you like it or not, your neighbor might be the next Andy Warhol or Madonna. Embrace and enjoy the times we’re living in!, ,The success of this story makes us chuckle. As much as we are very happy for Rafael Fuchs who opened Fuchs Projects at 56 Bogart in September, we can tell that it was the search term ‘naked women’ that drove all the traffic. Did you think that people are smarter that googling ‘naked women’? Nope, they aren’t…., ,In July, a very very awesome place opened: Delinquency. Bushwick Daily, as well as the entire neighborhood fell in love with this music venue on Metropolitan Ave to the extend that we featured it in ,. Unfortunately, the night we shot our short film at Delinquency was also the last night of it for the time being. We are impatiently waiting for Deliquency to return in 2013!!, ,It is true that big mainstream media play a huge role when it comes to defining a neighborhood. A NY Times review of Roberta’s contributed to creating a cult out of a pizza place; and a NY Times review of a gallery show in Bushwick contributed to defining Bushwick as the next gallery district., ,In early December, Observer ran a story about an independent mall likely opening at Bogart Street. “Grittier Chelsea Market,” the developers promise, however they add Urban Outfitters and Guitar Center as potential tenants in the same sentence. We believe that the problem of the real estate people is that it is highly problematic for them to recognize “cool” from “mainstream supra-national corporations.” Next time, consult Bushwick, dear Mr. Clemens.","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

"Featured,Opinion","The end of the year is my favorite time because that’s when we get to take a step back and think about everything that we have done. I personally click on the summaries of Bushwick Daily visitor stats, and take a look at the posts published in 2012. What I see frequently surprises, if not shocks me. Though, I have to note that it’s a very pleasant shock.,The first glance at our stats shows that Bushwick Daily did a quadruple flip back and managed to get 10 out of 10 for the landing as well. At the end of 2012 we are reaching , as we did in the beginning of this year (approximately 15,000 in January 2012 and 60,000 in December 2012). If you’re asking about the difference between 2011 and 2012, we have reached , (approx. 73,000 in 2011 and 390,000 in 2012).,I believe that there are several reasons why Bushwick Daily has been so very successful. First of all, I hate to sound like your dad, but consistently hard work pays off. In 2012 we have published over 440 posts, which means about 36 articles every month!! , worked together like a hive of busy bees to bring you lotsa original content.,Secondly, as we have been improving and growing, so has been Bushwick. A significant number of people moved in to the neighborhood and a significant number of businesses opened creating the environment of opportunities in our little pigeon town.  In other words, more and more people have been interested in what’s happening in Bushwick.,Throughout 2012, Bushwick Daily has appointed two new editors. After, his successful reign over Bushwick Daily in June as the sub Editor in Chief, , has become the Managing Editor.  , has been enthusiastically writing and photographing Bushwick with a focus on the music scene for Bushwick Daily since September 2011, and so it was no surprise that she became the 1st lady of Bushwick music scene aka our Music Editor in September 2012. Another lady behind the scenes who deserves a loving mention is Wesley Salazar who has been patiently copy editing our articles since 2011. , has brought a whole new level of awesomeness to Bushwick Daily by live DJ-ing for us every Monday with his buddy RG at ,.,Love, sweet love belongs to all our contributors who have been working really hard and really well to bring you the coverage of the beloved Town in the Woods.,A big chunk of love flows to our , who have believed in our vision and who have supported us.

Sponsored," ,It’s a Saturday or Sunday, and you wake up magically devoid of a hangover, having done all your laundry, grocery shopping, and other boring adult things for the week. (Ok, so the beginning of this article is hypothetical. But the rest isn’t!) Suddenly instilled with a desire to discover the best that Williamsburg has to offer, you decide to make a day – and night – of it.,Everyone will have their own opinion, some of them snarky, on what is worth doing if you only have twelve paltry hours to soak up the cultural deliciousness that is Williamsburg. However, I firmly believe everything below is a knock-out, guaranteed fantastic time. Unless you don’t like fun. In which case, I can’t help you.,Let’s start with ,, that wonderful invention of people who wake up too late to have both breakfast and lunch without off-setting their entire eating schedule. Brunch is a varsity sport in Williamsburg. If you only get one shot, do it right with Southern soul food on South 4, at Driggs—,. For the price and quantity, why would you ever go anywhere else? (Unless you’re weight-conscious, but it’s winter and everyone’s cold so who cares?) Try the Hippie Banjo biscuit sandwich (filled with egg, cheddar, avocado, tomato, sprouts and mayo for $7.50) or the go-to Chicken and Waffles ($10). Honestly, even if you go on an empty stomach and only eat pie, it would totally be worth it. The Apple and Grafton Cheddar Pie ($5.50) and Key Lime ($4.50) are just to die for!, ,Waddle your way back north to the much-celebrated ,, on North 7, between Kent and Wythe. It deserves its accolades, and is a palace of unique finds, funky local products, and cool local artists who want to talk to you about their work (and also sell it to you).,Yes, thrift stores are big in Brooklyn, and many of them are good. But the worst part about so many of them? They can’t shake the smell of an old mothball-y gym bag. Not so in ,, which in addition to smelling normal, has a great selection of thrifted clothes, shoes, bags, and jewelry, as well as new items that were overproduced or undersold. They are selective in their buying, and have an oft-rotated collection of designer threads (Marc Jacobs, Michael Kors, Stella McCartney, Miu Miu, etc.) hanging high on the walls, presumably to encourage drooling. The prices for these items are understandably higher, but even then are very reasonable for the craftsmanship; prices for the thrifted clothes are also fair. The staff is approachable and friendly, and won’t judge you when you just want to , if you could possibly pull off those floral jeans that are two sizes too small.,If, by now, you’ve sort of digested, it’s time for a trip to the , on Bedford at North 4,. These folks know their cheese, so if you want to wander in and say something incredibly vague such as, “I’m looking for something…blue? And…good?” they will coach you towards the best goddamned blue you’ve ever tried. Free samples abound, as does a strong cheese camaraderie fueled by knowing glances and the roll of eyes into the backs of heads as you try magnificent cheeses. Their collection of locally made ravioli, artisanal crackers, and imported charcuterie (some from near, others from far) is a fine complement to the pounds of dairy you will buy here.,Has it been over 90 minutes since you had caffeine? Time to refuel at , up on North 6, at Kent.,I have long been a fan of Sweetleaf’s Long Island City location for having baristas who take the time to explain the different types of espresso ($2.75) I can ,drink based on what kind of flavor I’m looking for, giant cookies that make you go om nom nom ($2.50), and a shabby-chic welcoming atmosphere. As with many establishments in the area, they also serve vegan and gluten-free snacks. Now that they’ve opened a new outpost in North Williamsburg, more happiness and caffeine for everyone! And a latte to go.,I used to dream about eating full-on meals while watching a new release in the movie theater, and it was only a year ago that I became aware that places actually do this. Thank you, Universe!,, at 136 Metropolitan Ave, does it very well. General admission is $11 (a steal by most NYC standards) and NiteHawk’s extensive and all-delicious , satisfies even the most finicky palates. You definitely get what you pay for, if not more. The movie theatre standard of popcorn gets an upgrade here, with truffle butter and citric salt for $8, with caramel for $7, and with regular butter and salt for $6. Each film has a tailored specials menu with cleverly-titled appetizers and entrees (for ,: “Close the Loop Doughnut Holes”, apple cider doughnuts served with caramel for $10) along with great sharing plates like their scallion-cilantro queso ($7) or fried calamari with sweet coconut ($8), a full liquor bar, and draught beers like Six Point Sweet Action, Brooklyn Radius, and Allagash White for $6 or $7. Of course, if any of this is too frou-frou, you can order a burger and fries/salad ($14) or soft-serve ice cream ($6).,NiteHawk’s repertoire ranges from documentaries and small-release pictures to movies for which you may actually have seen advertising (this upcoming weekend’s offerings include ,, the new Brad Pitt gore fest ,, ,, throwback midnight showings of kung-fu madness , and matinee showings of ,). There’s a cozy bar upstairs and a more spacious bar downstairs for drinks before or after your flick. If you’re fancy, they also have a range of wines available by the glass, carafe, or bottle.,If you choose not to eat at NiteHawk, or to indulge in my favorite meal of the day, Second Dinner, then head over to nearby ,, where you can get a garlic butter Butcher’s steak for only $15. If you’re not feeling red meat, they offer a variety of seafood options as well as veggie starters like grilled tomato and burrata ($12, which is fair considering the market price of burrata, a mozzarella cheese filled with cream). Their pan-grilled mashed potatoes are delicious, topped with truffle oil, and only $5.,The only drawback here can be the wait time, so try to get there early.,If you’ve got a few quarters left, head up to North 11, between Bedford and Berry, and spend them at ,—on the arcade games and on the drinks. If you’re a whiskey drinker, there are a plethora of different drams for you—61, in fact. * The most popular is the pickleback: a shot of Tom Lawless whiskey followed by one of pickle juice. If you’re not into whiskey or the aftertaste of pickle, a safe bet for the money is the vodka-based Grandma Joan’s Lemonade ($10). It tastes like childhood, but packs a punch (and comes in a tall glass), so be careful not to have more than two of these babies or you could find yourself in an intense face-off in Big Buck Hunter that you take way too seriously. This has never happened to me.,The arcade games are all $1 per person per play, and include basketball Street Shot, the aforementioned BBH, skee-ball (in which you can win a glass or a pitcher of beer if you do well), some shoot-‘em-up games, and more traditional games for free,, like foosball and shuffleboard. The cherry on top is the $5 per session photo booth, a favorite attraction, which gives you two copies of your strip. It also prints on non-flimsy photo paper, which sounds like a ridiculous thing to be excited about, but if you’re a photo booth aficionado, you know what I’m saying.,So that was your one-day whirlwind tour of the main drag of Williamsburg. As you will have gathered during your time here, there is so much more to see and do—so make sure you come back for more.,*The Whiskey Shop, adjacent to The Whiskey Brooklyn, offers 150 different whiskeys as well as other spirits. They also occasionally hold tastings, and their staff knows their whiskey like nobody’s business.,Like it so much you want to move here?

Music,"When we saw that the hip-hop producer and Ninja Tune label mainstay , was going to headline a DJ showcase at , on Saturday night, we felt , to see whether or not would his live performance be underwhelming.  His latest release, ,, as well as the excellent Music Scene from 2010 are ponderous down tempo affairs, seemingly better suited to a quiet solitary walk home from the subway station than to the cavernous and graffiti-inspired chic of the Paper Box performance space.,
The inspiration for Interludes After Midnight is supposed to come from late-night public access television programming, and anyone familiar with ,, the music video showcase hosted by “Uncle” Ralph McDaniels would surely get the reference. The album is a mélange of different music genres, effortlessly crisscrossing between progressive rock, Brazilian funk, languorous guitar chords and the occasional sample from those early morning exercise fitness instructors you heard your mom doing her pilates workouts to. As an auditory body of work, Interludes After Midnight is a veritable rabbit hole of skillfully crafted hooks and rhythms, but in the DJ performance model du jour, hip-hop is usually incorporated by taking some booty-shaking Dirty South music and throwing in a couple Skrillex-influenced drum-and-bass beats here and there.,As such, I was curious to see what kind of crowd would come to check out the performance of such an idiosyncratic hip-hop auteur, and how they would respond. On both counts, I was pleasantly surprised and admittedly, more than a little naïve. The show was like a high school reunion for hip-hop heads and casual listeners alike, not only drawing backpackers, but hipsters, hippies, punks, Orthodox Jewish club kids and a pretty popular guy dressed as Jesus who told me to get him something nice because his birthday was coming up.,As it turns out, Blockhead the hip-hop producer is also, you know, an actual DJ, equally capable of rocking a crowd by mixing up his own danceable tracks like Panic in Funkytown and Smoke Signals with such random gems as Phil Collins’ “In the Air Tonight,” all the while swaying and mouthing the words to his favorite selections. In sum, the Blockhead show was one of those rare chances to see a consummate hip-hop DJ flex their muscles on the proverbial wheels of steel. After his set was over, I went over to Blockhead, aka Tony Simon, and let him know that I was doing a write-up of his performance for the Bushwick Daily, to which he jokingly replied that he hoped that I wrote well of him. It’s the sort of playfully sarcastic false modesty you’d expect from a guy who titled one of his tracks, ,.

"Featured,People","Like the man who fell to Earth, Adriano landed in my lap inside the , . Out of nowhere. Up through the social media Rabbit Hole, straight into my DM inbox. The universe was uncanny in its thinking, this year. Upon meeting we both knew that we were embarking the age of innovation and re-awakening within the hybrid of music, technology, and performance. We knew that we both had something to offer and that it’s all happening right here in Bushwick.,And speaking of uncanny, two months after ‘meeting’ on Twitter we began to collaborate and perform together. Four months after we started performing we were both featured in two of the most important publications in Italy, one of them being ,. Today Adriano is responsible for an exhaustive list of gallery shows, music projects, compositions, and is a ,. Adriano is also responsible for what could easily be a breakthrough invention in performance-technology for the year 2012: ,. In simpler terms, it’s Body Instrument able to map the joints of the human body, tracking movements that are translated into musical impulses and sounds. Yeah, that happened in Bushwick. Here’s what’s next:, ,: When I moved to New York I actually landed in East Village for a month and then I moved to Bed-Stuy, a neighborhood that made me totally love Brooklyn. After a year I moved to Bushwick. New York was not in my plans actually, I wanted to move to San Francisco but after living here for three months I just got magnetized and somehow connected to the city in a mystic way.,I think Bushwick is a great place for a creative person in general. Living here, and being surrounded by amazing artists and visionaries from all over the world makes me feel home.,I describe myself more as a Interactive Sound Designer but I like the idea of sculpting sounds, modeling waves and craft samples. I work a lot with interactive technologies applied to music and visuals and as a profession I teach a software called Ableton Live that makes all this even more magic.,I think that we can make technology more humanized, and so as a result it might get more emotional than what we expected.,Bushwickers love to party more than anybody else on the planet! This is because there are venues and underground parties popping up constantly  here, and this makes the events more genuine than the pre-packed parties that happen in the city for example, which are controlled by different economic and logistic rules.,Bushwick is a decadent and sometimes punk town, it is hipster but not silly hipster like Park Slope; it’s geek and psychoactive at the same time. Bushwick runs on creative workflow, music and galleries and balance with the “natives” in a process that pushes more to the integration vs. a gentrification.,
It inspires me everyday and I believe that we can all make a difference here.,Bushwick is not exactly the place where I work, beside the private work I do in my studio on Wyckoff. I can say that I have had the chance to express myself, perform and show my works in several galleries, clubs, music venues and private events in Manhattan and Brooklyn as well, but the city remains the main container for what concern big events, and this most of the time happen because there are more money behind the events and some work based on interactive technology most of the time are expensive to install.,
Honestly, I feel that Bushwick is my home neighborhood, and it works great as a incubator of ideas that then can be exported everywhere.,As I told you I think that we can re-invent (and we are already doing it) the concepts of venue, gallery, shop. The keywords here are: Singularities inside the Collective. The energy that a lot of creative people create in the same space is enough to power an entire neighborhood. It’s up to us and to all the people who will decide to live here to be responsible and contribute to keep Bushwick a wild, sweet place.,Meta-Born-Birth was an exclusive piece for ReMixed Media Festival 2012.,
The piece represented a complete re-visitation of the performance as a medium and transformed the body in a facilitator that was able to transport the music and deliver the messages directly to the audience. All this taking advantage of a dress made of light, a prototype that worked perfectly and helped the computer to communicate directly with the body of the performer. The piece was a complex work that involved several type of technologies and was made in collaboration with a small group of artist/friends and Ana Lola Roman, do you know her? ,I consider myself a digital adventurer. It’s like a dungeon-and-dragons type of game; I love to discover and try new technologies. I also have to be careful not to get stuck and enslave myself to just one way of doing, but trying to re-invent my visions constantly. My key interest is the human evolution.

Despite its uncanny location, the restaurant is here to stay, with its classic furnishings, romantic atmosphere, friendly staff, and fantastic food.

In the Hood,"I don’t think “the holidays” are a good time for self-improvement, but it is a great time for crazy fun and forgiveness. Mostly forgiving yourself for whatever 2012 fuckups you’re still thinking about, but forgiving others is good, too. Therefore, this is my last post until after New Years.,I have a great date tip to share with you. It’s free, fun, and a wee bit daring, which makes it more of a bonding experience for a date: Get high and visit Santa! You can really find out a lot about someone when you hear what he or she wants from Santa and the pot will help steer the experience from self-conscious to absurdly hilarious. Plus it’s so unwholesome to be stoned on Santa’s lap!,Above is a video of my experience from a date with a man who is now my husband! The video is from a few years ago. We went to Santa at Macy’s Herald Square. They’re open until 9 p.m. and if you go late, there’s much less waiting and pesky children. I wanted a fancy facial and I didn’t know how to describe it to Santa, but the guy I was with married me anyway., ,: ,You’re in pain and I’m sorry. Everyone knows how that is. But I’m afraid the answer is right here in your question,,“He started seeing a girl he worked with (who was the root of many arguments) two months after the breakup and they’re still together. For some reason I’m suddenly having a very hard time dealing with it.”,It sounds to me like this guy likes having you around to build up his self-esteem, so he’s not upfront about letting you go. I believe this is why you are having a hard time dealing with it. He’s seeing someone else, as you know, yet he says he wants to be your friend, but then he doesn’t put any effort in. He’s a selfish, insecure pussy about telling you he has moved on, so if he won’t, I will.,You need to get in touch with your anger right away, girl! He’s been leading you on by saying he wants to be friends because he feels guilty about his new girl and he likes getting attention from you. No more of that. The best cure for you is to use your anger to get past him.,: ,It’s funny how all the different aspects of the holidays push our family upbringing buttons. If this is the first time her decorations have really gotten to you, I think you need to examine what memories holidays or holiday decorations bring up for you. I’m thinking you probably didn’t feel like you had enough control over the decorations growing up.,You may also be having some fear of commitment issues that are another mostly unspoken issue of holiday fallout. Are there some family invitations or events that are making you uncomfortable because they are too intimate for you?,I think you need to dial this back a bit, you may be overreacting; projecting heavy emotions onto holiday decorations right now is self-destructive. Stay in the moment and ignore the boring bows and white-only lights. A lot of the time creative people get on their “I’m creative and you’re not” high horse and that’s never a position in which a creative person can look good. Bear in mind that for all of us, “creative” or not, (by the way, everyone is creative in one way or another), our taste is one of the very basic ways we humans get to express ourselves. In the future, learning how to negotiate linen and bookshelf purchases is an important part of any relationship; it’s a way to help develop the tools needed to negotiate serious decisions later, no matter who the decorating partner is.","Dr. Lisa, S.P., is a self-proclaimed psychotherapist, artist, performer and comedian.

"Arts and Culture,Featured","For ,, year 2012 will forever be connected with ,, and the 100th anniversary of his birth. A year ago, Bushwick’s premier non-profit for arts joined the world movement to celebrate the life and work of one of the greatest composers and artists of the 20th century. Monthly events dedicated to John Cage speaking a number of artistic languages has been titled ,In creating the series, Norte Maar collaborated with ,, namely with its leading figure, legendary Julie Martin.,Lectures, poetry, ballet, electronic and classical music, Norte Maar has not only ventured across the boarders of the artistic disciplines but also far beyond the boarders of Bushwick. They have introduced a night of Cage at Dumbo Arts Center; at Park Avenue Armory or at National Academy Museum.  Norte Maar has been consistently proving, and the Cage Transmitted series has only confirmed that they have branched out from Bushwick and became a strong voice on the New York art scene, and thus fulfilling the Bushwick ideal – developing a successful home base for arts on an alternative basis outside of the old structures; in a small scale reaching a large audience and importance in New York.,We took a moment to reflect on the Cage Transmitted series as it reaches , with curator Jason Andrew and choreographer Julia Gleich from Norte Maar, as well as with Julie Martin from E.A.T.,: The Cage Transmitted series was planned as a monthly celebration of the centennial of John Cage’s birth, but once we got started, there were so many great people and ideas generated that we couldn’t limit it to just once a month. But we can’t talk about Cage Transmitted without Julie Martin, director of Experiments in Art and Technology (,) and our collaborator on the series. Julie was a driving force behind many of the year’s events. Personally I have been longing to work with her for a number of years. Cage Transmitted turned out to be the perfect opportunity. Julie really kept us focused. When we were worried about spreading ourselves too thin, she suggested another program! And when I was concerned about an audience she said, “It doesn’t matter how many people show up, it just matters that you did it.” That’s kinda my new mantra!,: I was interested in working with Jason and Norte Maar because of the wide scope of artists and events that he had been associated with. I was particularly interested in having lectures and performances that addressed areas of Cage’s ideas, interests, and works that would be new and surprising and keep the dialogue with Cage going into the future.,: You see, we began with some humble plans for collaboration that exploded into projects that led to collaborations not only with many artists but also amazing organizations like ,, ,, ,, ,, , and ,, ,, and for the final event will return to Bushwick at our friends, ,.,: I believe it exceeded our expectations. We had no idea when we started, what a great forum and following we would develop and how many new artists we would discover. Very early on Julie introduced us to ,, who was close to ,. John became our resident sound engineer for the series acting as our consultant to all this new sound media. We really couldn’t have done many of the experimental sound performances without him. And he’ll be with us for the final Cage Transmitted event on Thursday. There were so many people that were instrumental in furthering the series it’s hard to acknowledge them all.,: Again, my interest was to organize lectures that addressed Cage’s ideas, interests, and work that would keep a dialogue with Cage into the future. Lectures and talks like Susan Rosenberg’s “Cage’s influence on Trisha Brown”; Simone Forti’s talk on what she took from Cage; Kay Larson on the role of Buddhist thought on Cage and a generation of New York artists; and of course the showing of Virginia Dwan’s 1982 interview with Cage after his reading of his then newly composed work “James Joyce, Marcel Duchamp, Erik Satie: An Alphabet.”,: The types of events were so varied, including dance and music, artists and writers, talks and poetry. I was jealous to not have seen the talk by the legendary , and performance by experimental musician ,. But I did spend a fun day dancing in the Museum with ,.,: Exhausted? Heavens no. Just like the ,, there are endless possibilities.,: What’s the Latin word for 101st?,: I still have a few ideas up my sleeve!,: Probably the , event at the National Academy Museum. It was Norte Maar’s first museum collaboration and the first ever dance collaboration at the museum. I curated and programmed all the dancer/choreographers and felt so privileged at the quality of the artists who accepted our invitation. Choreographer, , was actively involved in this collaboration and we were thrilled to work with him too. But it was probably when our friend the curator of Contemporary and Modern Art, Marshall Price, came into the gallery excited by the queue outside his museum that made that day most memorable! We all felt privileged to be in the museum space surrounded by the spectacular exhibition of John Cage’s works and the buzz of all the different performers coming into the space!,: I’d have to agree with Julia. Cage on Vinyl was too much fun! But I’m also quite fond of the performances in the front room of Norte Maar. Our first Cage event took place there with the audience watching outside from the street through the windows. Our , event presented in collaboration with Triple Canopy was also one to remember. My gosh there were so many great events!,: I loved in general, the performances by younger artists like Stephen Vitiello, Atau Tanaka, the Irish group Strange Attractors with their amazing durational sound performance, the collaborative performance put together by electronic musician Lesley Flanigan that included Maria Chaves and MV Carbon. But most of all the enthusiastic energy and can-do attitude of my collaborators Jason and Julia.,: The long distance collaboration has it difficulties but we happen to love Skype and spend many hours working together on it. Julia has met many a new artist through sitting on Skype with me.,: While it would be nice to be here in person, I am able to come back frequently enough, that we have done more dance projects this year. Including , with ,, which by the way included a tribute to Cage, ,, CO-LAB at Dumbo Arts Center, the first Cage Transmitted in the apartment gallery and of course , in April. It has been a very full year for dance. Much of the preliminary work can be done through e-mails and we take turns setting up face-to-face meetings for each other with potential artists and collaborators.,: I love to interact with all the artists and partners in collaboration and I keep Julia in the loop about everything going on, but we support each other and also know each other’s strengths and areas of expertise. Sometimes the best collaborator is someone who you can bounce ideas off. And speaking of that, Julie Martin has played a huge role. We had regular phone meetings. She is an endless supply of ideas and she lives in New Jersey. So it is a triple long-distance collaboration.,: Jason recently wrote that , was trying to eliminate his own ego from his process and in doing so freeing sounds to be themselves. I like this idea and find it difficult and perplexing too. But if anything, I want Norte Maar to have an open embrace of dance ideas and not be stuck in elitist, traditional or otherwise expected modes of presentation. I like to think that with Norte Maar anything can happen.,: John Cage means endless possibilities and the many countless variations between.,: Cage is a way of inviting everyone into your aesthetic where nobody is and everyone is.","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

They said their panic time was two weeks ago when they were dealing with the framing.

Arts and Culture,"If there’s one thing I’ve learned while living in Bushwick it’s that the best parties and venues are often found by word of mouth. Saturday night was looking dull until a friend told me about ,, a newly opened, art/party space on Irving Ave completely hidden by pulling a drop-down wall in front of it.,Once we arrived we were given two playing cards and a few instructions. Find three other people at the party to make a full house and we’ll give you a dollar shot, the door guy said. A meet up game combined with a celebratory ending. It was going to be a good night.,“It’s very underground Brooklyn,” my friend said, probably due to the fact that we were literally underground surrounded by graffitied walls and strobe lights. The DJ spun his house music while partygoers swayed and played with balloons scattered around the floor. Every now and then one would pop, but never deterred the dancers.,The vibe was similar to a typical house party, except being surrounded by art in the upstairs gallery.  “We knew a lot of artists and musicians and we thought ‘Lets create a space,’” Sei Smith, one of the founding brothers, said when asked how Apostrophe was born.,Sei and Ki Smith opened the space in September and searched for a name for a month before settling on Apostrophe, derived from a Frank Zappa album. The brothers (who live in the venue) plan live music every weekend and open the gallery Wednesday through Friday.,The guys book diverse acts that bring hipsters and kids from the hood together to create a community-gathering space. “It’s a great mix,” Sei said. “The old and the young create a good energy.”,The Smith brothers have the start of something great here, and didn’t bother with the law when it came to their goals. “Our generation realizes our potential but it’s hard to get there,” Sei said. “Instead of over thinking it just do it, beyond the law or whoever, just do it.”,If you want to experience a casual party scene but still hear good music and be surrounded by art, then this is the place to go.

People,"Alan – now living on Staten Island with his parents while recovering from a spinal surgery earlier in the year – was fortunate as far as Staten Island residents go. Describing the scenario to me he said, “Half of my Island is gone. I went outside and saw the damage to our place, half of the roof torn off and a tree down in my yard. But that’s nothing, people are still being found there.”,His gallery, Gasser Grunert in Chelsea was not so fortunate. It could be estimated that he alone lost $45,000 worth of art. His evaluation of the loss is more immediate. “My gallery held on to some of his best pieces for obvious reasons. A line work entitled , created from twenty lines on red paper was ripped in half.”,More difficult to process was the destruction of a dedication piece for three friends who passed away. “I wasn’t able to draw a picture about them for a long time. Until last year. I put them all in one scene and that thing is wrecked. I was trying to get it off of consignment to get it to one of the families.”,“When I do a dedication of someone who passed away and then that gets destroyed. That’s rough. But Scott Ewald told me that ‘You haven’t even done your best work yet.’ That was good to hear.” On a hopeful note, “The collages that were destroyed may find their way into new collages.”,The last time that he and I spoke was for an interview before the hurricane. We talked about his growing up in New York, what he misses, what he’s looking forward to, artistic ambitions, and an oddly prescient hypothetical. When discussing his birth, which took place in Bushwick during the ’77 black out, he asked me “What would you say if we woke up tomorrow and I told you that 70 buildings had burned down overnight? The city was at war.”,I asked him what he thought about the oddness and fierce reality of that statement in the wake of that storm.,“The new extreme tragedy of New York City? I’m feeling it very hard emotionally as an artist, a sensitive guy in general. It’s pretty dramatic. I’m trying to use the shows I had lined up and turn them into pieces about the situation here. I get a lot of wisdom from Gary Boake, he lost his eye, half is arm and leg in an automobile accident. He’s the second man down in the show so we went back and forth until we came up with NYC Healing.”,He staged a Living Installation performance on November 9th, which doubled as a fundraiser and canned food drive for Staten Island. It was originally billed as a healing show to celebrate his relative recovery from the surgery and evolved into NYC Healing. In ABC No Rio, where the water damage is apparent from years of leaks, he and a bevy of performers put on an eight hour performance fresh off of the flooding, loss, and surgery.,“It’s hard to raise money with the shows I do, but we did raise something. It was hard to even put that show on, we kept losing power during the show. It was days after the hurricane, we could barely get the equipment over the bridge. Physically, I can’t do as much as I want to in volunteering. But there are different needs, what I can do is art. In a sense it’s art therapy. Everyone who came to that show got something out of it.”,We met during Thanksgiving week before his second Living Installation that month – entitled Thanks-Living. He said to me in October, “The only thing in my heart is love anymore. I want to go forward with that and let it come out of everything I do from now on.”,And now, “I’m trying to do positive art actions. It is very dramatic since our last meeting. I’m trying to stay strong, I’m a person too.”,“Instead of going dark I’m trying to work with the community and with different people. I just found out that an old friend passed away. It wasn’t from the storm, but it’s still life. He was one of the original performers in Draw-A-Thon who would let me paint on him and make him into sculptures. I have to add Dave 1, R.I.P.”,Upon coming into North Brooklyn to attend a Halloween party put on by his friend Kenny Scharf, Alan felt mixed emotions about seeing the relatively untouched areas in which he was born and used to live. He was coming from Staten Island, where people were still out and out – he was in his words, stinky and cold – almost cancelling on the party where he was projecting in a back room.,“I think it’s amazing and sad that this storm humanized Staten Island. You watch the news and people are astonished to recognize that the person on television from Staten Island is a person. I’m tired of the prejudice against it. There’s good and bad everywhere. People are people.”,He wanted to flip the interview on me, “We were talking about how the first interview was like a local boy makes good story. My question for you is how are you doing?” he asked. We were redoing the interview because so much had happened in the intervening weeks and because my laptop had been taken, with the only copy of the first interview’s audio, transcription and initial story’s first 1,000 words.,“What makes you stay?” he asked when I told him that I’d seriously considered leaving the city just a month and a half ago.,“I didn’t want to give up.” I said.,“Put that in the story. That’s what it’s all about. Don’t give up. It’s relevant, that’s what people need to hear.”,Three days later the laptop and interview was returned. Three days after that Thanks- Living was performed. Jerry Rid and Michael Kronenberg were the hosts of Thanks-Living, it was a dedication to Dave 1, the late performer.,At one point during the performance Jerry Rid joined the stage and was covered in “Odin Lives Forever” stickers until his head looked like a blooming flower. The music died down and Michael Alan yelled out “Dave! Daaave! Davvveee!” it was quiet, then “Alright, fuck you!” The cycle of life continues and we are reminded daily to give thanks. Everything can disappear in a flash.,“New York is kind of like lost New York.” Alan says as we finish, “I’m trying to keep it New York, the energy that I remember.”",Sean Alday is a writer originally from the Florida Keys and now residing in Bushwick. He is the co-director at 950 Hart where he curates art shows in his home and asks you to come in and see. He can usually be found talking to someone.

Mind and Body,"*,* If that’s how your back sounds, maybe it’s time for you to get a massage. And I’m not talking about a back rub from that Chinese lady who lives on your street. I mean a proper medical, deep tissue massage that will restore and heal what needs to be healed. The wonderful news is that , just launched their wellness program and now offer massage sessions with a licensed therapist. I did some serious field journalism and tried the massage out for you. Here’s how it went…,“Our goal is to offer a complete health and wellness experience to the community, as the name loom means weaving the mind, body and spirit,” said Zalmen Labin, founder of the Loom Yoga Center in a very Zen manner. If you do yoga at The Loom, you probably noticed that they have expanded over the summer and significantly expanded their studio. Thanks to this you won’t ever have to hit your neighbor while in Warrior II again.,The wellness center is now right next to the reception. You can slip in after your regular yoga or pilates class and pick one of the massage therapies now offered at The Loom: Swedish, deep-tissue, clinical, sports, prenatal and postnatal massages. I tried the Swedish massage, and instructed my therapist Beret Kirkby to focus on my upper back as I frequently feel tension in that area “thanks” to my constant work on a laptop. Beret was really thorough and soon my back muscles felt relaxed and smooth. She also periodically asked if certain pressure hurt and how each area felt - but I assure you that no pain was present. On the contrary, I was slowly falling deeper and deeper into a massage nirvana.,Additionally, the massage therapy room is dimly lit and nicely heated with world music playing in the background. Once the massage was over, I felt like I could easily do a back flip if I wanted to. (I didn’t want to, in case you’re curious.) I also felt really thirsty. “That’s because your body is getting rid of the toxins,” said Beret. She also recommended a run or a long hot shower, so that all the nasty toxins leave my body more easily. After the massage with Beret Kirkby, my body and mind felt cleansed and relaxed.,Especially during the holidays, when we tend to stress out more than usual, a massage can feel like a little luxurious present for yourself. The best part is that during the Holidays everything is 10% off at Yoga Loom. So for a 30-minute long massage with a licensed therapist who really know what she’s doing, you’ll only spend $40., , , ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

In the Hood," brought news this morning that an 80,000-square-foot retail and nightlife complex is being planned at 88 Bogart St.,“North Development Corp. acquired the 200-by-400-foot behemoth across the street from the Morgan L train stop in August for $12.15 million, and the developer plans to turn the building, which takes up an entire block, into a sprawling nightlife, retail and artist gallery complex on an otherwise underwhelming stretch in Bushwick,” Observer writes.,Andrew Clemens, a director of leasing at Massey Knakal, the firm selected to exclusively market the space, told Observer that while the project is in the very preliminary, conceptual stage, the idea is to create something like a “grittier Chelsea Market.” An independent movie theater, music venue or museum are expected to be the potential big tenants. There was mention of an Urban Outfitters or Guitar Center. Clemens also said that they are considering studio workspace for artists on the upper floor or maybe a hotel/hostel.,Andrew Clemens said that they plan to cater to the local artsy, hipster crowd as Williamsburg is not considered cool by locals anymore. “Bushwick is cool,” he said.,A mall at Bogart St sounds pretty unimaginable at the moment. The project is in its initial stage; the concepts and ideas are being laid. The change is clearly inevitable, but the question is whether we will see a new kind of cultural entrepreneurship which is considerate to the local rich culture or simple mainstream madness. We believe it’s now up to Bushwick to have its voice heard. What is your opinion?,[,]","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

In the Hood," , ,The , isn’t a typical NYC-based Brass band. The funky 10-piece crew is fresh on the scene, and is a amalgamation of big personalities- or as they self-proclaim, a crew of “composers, producers, artists, rappers, strivers, hustlers, and superstars”. Their multi-faceted talents certainly shined through during their set, mashing up sounds from many generes- rap, rock and hip-hop- in their slick, saxaphone-heavy jazz rhythms. Their music is definitely sexy, and defintely a strong sound of young, innovative, genre-bending collaboration. They are a helluva lot of fun.

In the Hood,"As I pointed out last week, sex and partying are important, but to really have a healthy emotional life, working hard and being productive is a key ingredient. As a matter of fact, Hyperallegeric.com ran a story this week on the same theme of being productive in artsy places like Bushwick, titled: ,  I struggle with this shit myself (hello hours spent at Pine Box). Btw: If you’re an artist supporting your art with a day job, the day job counts in the hard work/productivity category. The hard part is motivating for your other job, art making.,Angela Washko, who is an overachiever—has a great social life, makes tons of art and dresses great on no money. I tried to get Angela to share some of her secrets. Angela, who is 26,already has a resume that is way too long to be included here (it has seven categories!). Most recently she served as curator of the ,. Plus, she kicks ass at applying for and getting residences, so she has traveled far and wide without having a lot of cash. Some of the places she’s had a residency:,Finland, Iceland, Philadelphia, and the Flux Factory, New York, NY (she ran the residency program there as well). Plus whenever I see her out, which is fairly often, she is having fun and surrounded by cool people. Oh, I’m sure she has her shit too, but that’s not the point right now.,A. That is a tough question actually.  I have always felt compelled to participate in as many different and challenging things as possible.  In high school (and before) I participated in marching band, jazz band, chorus, field hockey, basketball, soccer, track and field, and created artwork. (Not to mention playing video games and reading a whole lot!)  It’s taken me a long time to focus on things that are actually interesting to me, which is now basically creating my own artwork/research, facilitating/curating exhibitions and events, and going on adventures.  I think finding a subject that is exciting to me and working on new projects challenges me to make new work.  Participating in an exciting community of people doing innovative, challenging things drives me to organize. The pursuit of things I’ve never seen or places I’ve never gone drives me to go on adventures.  I’m not very interested in “nice things” or “lucrative career things”.,A. I guess it is easier to maintain your social life when so many of your friends are all creating challenging, engaging art pieces and you end up going to their awesome performances/exhibitions/talks/events.  So it’s kind of like killing two birds-with one stone.  You get to cross off a social obligation AND see really great art.  I guess I also end up organizing tons of events that include my social community, so sometimes I end up achieving my social obligations by default when my friends show up.  The biggest obstacle is always feeling overwhelmed!  When I produce too much, I’m not taking in enough of the outside world and enjoying the sillier things I like to go to (karaoke, dance parties, The Chris Gethard Show, anything at Flux Factory, walks in forests, odd little post industrial towns) which ultimately improves my own artwork.  If I go to too many of these things and socialize a lot, and then have work obligations and other commitments, I sometimes feel like I am not getting enough of my work done, and that can make me a little depressed, lost, and irritable.,A. I was living a life of extreme poverty for a while—always having just enough money to get by month to month, living in alternative housing situations, eating communally and frugally.  I am still incredibly frugal, but in the past year I have gotten more steady jobs and, consequently, more reliable income. Now I also get honorariums for site-specific works and curatorial projects.,The big travel opportunities have just recently happened.  Now that I’ve created a lot of work, that has been shown and performed at increasingly more prestigious places—institutions pay me to go there!  I just got a grant from the Danish Arts Council to do a research visit and meet with artists in Copenhagen.  I also am headed to Helsinki after that for a fully funded residency.  I am experiencing this nice shift from applying for everything to being asked to participate and getting to be more selective.  –In 2010 and 2011 I paid for residencies.  But now one of my criteria for participating in residency programs is that they are funded or at least offer decent fellowships.  I have also always been poor and resourceful—so I am willing to look for money and go through all kinds of bureaucratic bullshit to get it!  If I don’t find it, I can’t go anywhere.,A. Aw gee, thanks!  *Blush!* I think figuring out what kind of art is interesting to you and finding a community that is actively making work that you like is an essential first step to having fun and being productive.  Being around other artists who I respect and who are very motivated inspires me to organize events surrounding those people and also gets me psyched about making my own work.  It also improves my “art world” vernacular!  I also work with (and consider my friends) a lot of activists, pranksters, troublemakers, performers, and radical collectives—people that are (generally) inherently fun. These people help my practice by introducing me to things I otherwise wouldn’t know—histories, artists, books, variety shows, improv performances—which make my art more informed and also lead to good times.,A. I have always been attracted to ambitious, specialist, know-it-all people that can also fix things. I really admire people that see things and say “I can fix that” as opposed to ignoring it (whether it’s a tiny hole in my backpack or a public transit problem). I think that attitude is really sexy.  I let things slide sometimes because of my own inflated perception of how busy I am.  But I only find myself attracted to people who are actively engaged in research and figuring out ways to both get shit done and be the change they want to see.  I can’t say there are really too many lazy people in my life, so I guess I am inherently not attracted to laziness.,A. You are too kind. I think that sometimes I am a little bit aggressive and I have been told a couple of times that this can be emasculating. I like to pick up people bear-hug style. I am also someone that lacks a filter, so I will argue with anyone about anything sometimes. This can be a little socially awkward and occasionally not very gracious. My lack of a filter also leads me toward being frank about everything!  I am not interested in games. I always end up asking guys out because if I am interested, I will go crazy if I don’t know that it is mutual.  I haven’t had too many dating disappointments because of being intimidating; I think that if someone were immediately intimidated by me, we’d just never click. I am a tomboy at heart and most of my closest friends are men. I find myself behaving socially and career-wise more like a dude .  I also think I actually intimidate more women than men—which is sometimes a little frustrating.,
Getting to know good people is always a healthy choice. If you take things super slow and are upfront right away about your plans, there is some risk of heartbreak, but honestly what is the alternative—saying no to human nature? I do think in this case however, it is super important to emphasize the go-slow part. You don’t want to integrate someone into your life too quickly and then feel like you’re cutting off your arm when you move. This is always a good practice anyway. Some people are more careful about adopting a pet then they are jumping into a relationship with somebody., ,    ,    ","Dr. Lisa, S.P., is a self-proclaimed psychotherapist, artist, performer and comedian.

He added that Bushwick is slowly but surely becoming a good brand in the world of art: “When fair visitors see the signage at the fair that locates us in Brooklyn, many people ask if we are in Bushwick, especially Europeans and Asians.

So far we’ve brought you neighborhood recommendations for , - great restaurants and bars serving everything from comfort food, to Vietnamese pho, to classic cocktails; , - visit museums, take classes, and even go kayaking for free; and now we’re turning on sights on where to live in this beautiful area.While LIC is a ‘neighborhood,’ it’s actually comprised of a bunch of smaller neighborhoods, including Hunters Point, Queens Plaza, Court Square, and Dutch Kills., ,When people think of Long Island City, they are usually thinking of Hunters Point (,). Originally Hunters Point referred to the piece of land the juts out into the East River near Newtown Creek, but these days it refers to a larger area, bordered by the East River to the west, Queens Plaza to the north, Newtown Creek to the south, and Skillman Avenue to the east.,Hunters Point for a long time was primarily an industrial neighborhood full of factories and bakeries, but these days it has embraced a rapid rate of development and turned out some impressive buildings, both new and renovated.,The waterfront is home to a number of high-rise residences, including , (originally a real power station for the LIRR and Pennsylvania RR) and , (home to LIC’s most expensive condo); rental buildings, including , (part of the East Coast development), ,, and ,; and the oldest of the high rise buildings, , co-op (co-ops are rare in this part of LIC).,The waterfront continues to see new developments rise up; in particular two new residential rental towers to be built as part of the extensive TF Cornerstone , development along Center Blvd near 46th Ave. It will be 21-acre development that sits on the location of a former Pepsi-Cola bottling plant. Rentals, condos, and retail are planned for this area. 3,000 residences will be built in total; the project is over halfway through, with four towers completed and three to go.,The large , project will be built on the tip of Hunters Point, just south of Gantry Plaza State Park. It will be a mixed-use middle-income housing development on 30 acres of waterfront property with up to 5,000 units available.

Editor's Pick,"Bushwick, embrace yourself for jingles, Christmas trees, carols and awesomely tacky lights that every proper Bushwick house hold should have installed by now! Holidays are around the corner and that means an influx of holiday parties, craft markets and whiskey blended egg nog. Yum!,Before we indulge ourselves in the seasonally festive atmosphere, let’s take a look at the coolest cultural and art events happening in the hood this week!,On Friday evening do not even think about missing out on recent works by Naomi Safran-Hon and Shirley Wegner at Slag Gallery located at 56 Bogart. Once you’re there, say hi to energetic gallery owner Irina Protopopescu who is so charmant that you will be crushing on her in no time, whether you’re a boy or a girl. No joke…, ,As we get older the toy objects we crave change, but the desire for the toys remain strong. New art show at Parallel Art Space (17-17 Troutman) explores the concept of the toy and how it changes as we move into different stages of life. Sounds like a fun night to us!,Et al Projects, a gallery at 56 Bogart invites you to the solo show of painter Devon Dunhill Clapp on Friday evening. In the work and imagery of Dunhill Clapp one recognizes taboo and kitsch, indiscretion and language, death and sensuality. Clapp explores “the fetishized natural world, where dualities at first seem contradictory but on careful examination they are revealed to have parallel affects.”,Outpost Artists Resources in Ridgewood have teamed up with Ghana ThinkTank for a series of workshops and events focused on solving the “American Problems.” The think tank analyzes problems collected in the first world and proposes solutions. The solutions are put back in the community where the problems originated whether the proposals seem impractical and others are brilliant. The first workshop is taking place this Friday and the series will continue through December 14.,I think that we will all agree that Bushwick has almost all kinds of fun activities. The only thing we might have been missing is a proper karaoke night. But luckily for a karaoke fix you can now head to Cobra Club every Friday night.  Dance, squeal and squeek with Sarah Booz & Esquire.,…and finally a holiday sale of prints and jewelry! On Saturday, after brunch, head to Forth Estate Studio on 272 Morgan Ave. Oh, there will be a printmaking workshop as well!,Curator David Gibson claims that when looking at any work of art, we at first have to render it as real, and then as beautiful, or at least useful.

On Friday they are hosting another installment of the Brooklyn Poets Reading Series. Join them for the night with poets Jenny Zhang, Jennifer L.

In the Hood,"I’m going to answer this sexual question that I received this week, but before I do, I would like to share this artwork with great advice for artists from seasoned professional, , In the last few weeks all we seem to talk about is sex. I just want to remind people how important working hard is for the soul, particularly if you have a creative pursuit and also need to make a living. Hard work is the best way to make yourself feel better and have balance in your life. It also takes a lot more grit and self-discipline than sex or eating. If you look closely at the top of Powhida’s piece, it says “move to Bushwick,” so you’re already off to a good start. Don’t waste it! Although Powhida’s artwork has the word “cynical” in front of “advice”, here’s a man who, besides showing and selling his work consistently, has a job teaching , a wife.,BTW: Please send in some career questions for next week. I want to see some inspired people out there trying to get shit done., , The problem here, from what I can tell, is that you are bringing too many six packs of guilt into bed with you. And the guilt is getting in the way of you communicating with your partner. It’s not your fantasies that are the problem, it’s that you have to keep it to yourself, which creates an intimacy barrier between the two of you. And it now sounds like you are caught in a spiral, which you fear will get worse. As an attempt to exorcise your guilt, I am officially approving your fantasies and behavior. Someone’s getting to you and judging you—who is it: the Pope, Judge Judy, your mom or dad? Banish them from your head and your sex life. Bring them out for charity events and family gatherings you’re not in the mood to attend.,Listen up people—this is for all of you—,It’s no one’s fault, it’s just the way it is. You can continue to spice things up on your own or you can bring your partner into the mix. IMHO, sharing porn is the most efficient way to do this. Take turns picking out videos that you both watch together. It will do the double duty of getting you both aroused as well as teaching each other new favorite tricks without having a heavy ’splaining conversation if you’re not up for that.

"Featured,In the Hood","I’m not the only one who decided to endulge in my passions while majoring in a not-so-practical concentration in college. I’m sure half of our reader base did the same thing- English majors, Painters, Classics, I’m looking at you. Some of us are lucky enough to be living our dream and making rent off of our artistic skills. For the rest of plopped out into the career no man’s land of NYC, pursuing our interests fruitlessly, there’s always dog walking, waitressing, and drug peddling. Just kidding. Or am I?,That’s why I decided to take a class at ,, Bushwick’s media-based adult education center. A self-taught Photoshop dependent, my futility impulses and minor ADD kick in whenever I try to learn a new program. For the member price of $209, I took a three-week, 9-hour intensive, ,, and learned how to navigate the software better than I could have in 50 hours on my own., Having an artistic eye, creative impulses and working knowledge of Photoshop are great credentials, but let’s face it- in this economy, unless you know the full Adobe suite, you’ll be extremely lucky to find even the most basic job in creative digital media. So, I unbuckled my belt and prepared to get my creative Mojo a-flowing.,My class was taught by patient yet prudent ,, a Brooklyn local, and a renowned multi-media artist. , revolves around patterns printed onto fabrics and assorted animation video projects. After browsing her website I learned that she’s not only a teacher at 3, Ward but also has lectured at the likes of Stanford and The Museum of Art and Design.,I was undeniably the youngest student in the class, but was among others with similar interests and many who wanted to benefit their own businesses by stepping up their online/print presence by creating logos, business cards, designing personalized graphics, etc. I wanted to learn to use my abstract design drawing/painting style in an online format that I can built print profits off of. That’s the dream, at least.,In the 3 weeks of learning, plus much practice at home, I now feel confident with my Illustrator skills – enough to list them on a resume even! I learned the basics of the program, the various tools (pen, pencil, brush, etc), the swatches (patterns, gradients, symbols) and text formatting. With a bit of creativity and some practice, Illustrator isn’t the intimidating villain I imagined it to be. Having a patient teacher to guiding me though each step and providing practical advice on what to use each tool for really made a difference.,In fact, I’ve started to design my own line of greeting cards to give as gifts for Christmas. On a barely-employed budget, or even on full-time-with-benefits budget, imaginative homemade gifts are a fabulous money saver! Maybe there’s even a way to turn a profit in the future.,3, Ward is waiting for all of us creatives who might be intimidated or unequipped to tap into the right brain.

"Featured,Food and Drink","Good news for anyone who suffered through , : there’s a new bar in its place, and it’s probably not going to mysteriously transform into a Thai restaurant anytime soon. ,, co-owned by Lucas Walters (of Williamsburg’s The Commodore) and Jason Merritt (of nearby wine shop Big Tree Bottles) opened last month in the Morgan’s old spot off its namesake subway stop, and it’s serving up classic down-home food and drink in a lovely, old-school space.,Walters named Tutu’s in memory of his grandmother;”tutu” means “grandmother” in Hawaiian; and the bar itself is fashioned as a testament to her, in a way. The bar is comprised of a front room, a back room and a basement, and the front room is filled with antique portraits, artwork and other knickknacks pilfered from employees’ and owners’ homes. Both the front room and back room bars are made of beautiful, classic finished wood, and the basement, which will function as a dance/party space once the heating system kicks in, features vintage church pews. Even the bathrooms are unique – one is papered with pages from old textbooks, another lined with paisley print.,Tutu’s serves brunch and dinner, and rotating food options are tasty but limited. We sampled the mushroom sliders ($10), and while we found them to be a bit crumbly for our liking, they came paired with superb rosemary shallot fries. They were also serving a lamb burger ($14), sautéed brussel sprouts ($8) and a kale salad ($12) that came with brazil nuts, eggs, and goat cheese. For dessert, we tried some delicious fresh apple cider doughnuts ($6) dipped in sweet apple reduction, which were delightfully crispy on the outside and soft and gooey within. As for the drinks, we had a “Penicillin” ($10) made with Laphroaig whiskey, blended Scotch, ginger and honey. The drink was tart, strong and to our liking, though once the extra-large ice cubes melted it did get a bit watered down. The kitchen also offers a number of meat and cheese plates, and is currently open ’til midnight, although they plan to have a late night menu available until 2 a.m. in the future.,On weekend nights, DJs (including Walters) spin music in Tutu’s, and the owners say they’ll soon throw parties in the back room and basement – we even threw our , there earlier this month. They’ve also got a projector where they plan to show movies and sports games like the Superbowl, and see the spot serving as a popular neighborhood joint. For us, Tutu’s is a bit too pricey to be our go-to bar, but we’ll certainly be back again, if just for another glimpse of the decor., , , ,Further reading: ’, ","Writer, blogger, Brooklynite and carbo-loader.","bogart street,brunch,drinks,hipster grandmother,Jason Merritt,lucas walters,Morgan Stop,supper,The Morgan,Tutu's Bar","

I recently left the great state of Texas and my first tattoo was meant to represent my journey from Texas to Bushwick. The state flower of Texas (a bluebonnet) is a classic Texan reminder to living and breathing in Bushwick today.,Gnostic Tattoo has already been gaining the reputation as the go-to place in Bushwick. Co-owner Leaf Chang, an artist and Boston native, has lived in New York for the past ten years and is excited to branch out by starting his own business.,A mixture of religions and pagan deities surrounds the tattoo shop and might make tattoo virgins like myself feel a little confused but strangely relaxed. “Tattoos have always played a part in ancient religions and cults, ” Leaf said, explaining the small touches of ancient religions and traditions that are located throughout the shop.,When it came close to getting down to business, the soothing trickle of the fish tank and the print of The Virgin Mary doing a line of coke seemed to tell my pounding heart, “You’re making the right decision.”,The paper work had been signed and the ink was being poured; there was no turning back. I was laid out on a plushy chair that felt like it belonged in a dentist’s office – my bare arm about to get its cherry popped.,My artist Maggie was more than accommodating once she began. “It’s not so much about the tattoo as it is about the art,” she said when asked why she wanted to tattoo.,I was getting close to jerking my naked arm away from the invasive tattoo gun, when Maggie reassured me that the process wouldn’t be as terrible as I imagined (I have a slight fear of needles).,She started with a small line, and I was finally ready to lose my tattoo virginity. Obviously the feeling of a foreign object being inserted into my skin was a little weird, but within a few minutes my skinny arm went limp., , , ,After a while my arm was telling me she had had enough, but I focused on The Virgin Mary.

"Featured,Opinion","Anthropology students Sidsel Filipsen & Jonas Bruun Nielsen share some observations they’ve made studying gentrification in New York and Bushwick in particular.,When doing anthropological research on gentrification in Bushwick one quickly finds out, that it is not a thing easily done – especially when you’re not even from this country., We came from Copenhagen having seen what we believed to be gentrification in our own city, but as expected, things move a lot faster in New York. That is probably why gentrification has much more of a place in people’s minds over here. Telling people in Denmark what were going to study all we got was “gentrifi-what?” But in Bushwick everyone seems to have an opinion about the topic – whether they think it’s good, bad, neutral or natural. What has surprised us more is that no one really seems to agree on what gentrification actually is., – Anonymous Bushwickian,And in New York, so it seems. There is hardly anything to do about it. We’ve seen it in Soho, we’ve seen it in Williamsburg, we’ve seen it tons of other places all around the city. People move because they have to, because the rent goes up. But when they do so, the rent goes up somewhere else and then other people have to move., – Anonymous Bushwickian,But yet that would be oversimplifying the whole thing, wouldn’t it? Gentrification often also means lower crime rates, better infrastructure, more art- and cultural events. Or does it?, – Anonymous Bushwickian,To some gentrification means Starbucks. To some it means displacement, of themselves or others. To some it means flourishing art and cultural life. To some it means diversity and different kinds of people living side by side. One thing seems for sure though. Gentrification is a buzzword, and a kind of indefinable one at that. Whether it is good or bad, and what it actually means to people, still seems stranded in uncertainty., , ",,"anthropology study,Bushwick,copenhagen,gentrification","

In the Hood,"Let’s just say, I’m a Thanksgiving cynic. I can’t help but see bullshit in some of those “Happy Thanksgiving” greetings. I may not be popular, but I can relax in my honesty. There are so many reasons why Thanksgiving can be frustrating. One big reason is loss of control over basics like where and when in regards to eating, sleeping, going places. This is the same reason why I hate group outings, which is the essence of Thanksgiving. The times that I’ve been single are the ones that have bugged me the most. When you are single, you are much more vulnerable to other people’s whims, with no one to complain to privately afterward. Of course then there is the time I was with my boyfriend when I walked into my Aunt Amanda’s house one year and upon seeing me she exclaimed, “You’ve gained weight!” right in front of him.,You’re bad. OK, now do you feel better? You know what you did is wrong, so think about your motivation for what you did so you don’t find yourself in this same situation again.

I’m wondering if there’s some unresolved conflict within your family that you’re repeating—I hope not, but it’s worth noting. If there is, it’s too complicated for an advice column and would be worth finding a therapist to discuss this with. At any rate, you made an error a year ago. It is time to move on and keep your mouth shut. Let the guilt that you’re experiencing be the reminder to never let this happen again. Your sister’s boyfriend does not sound like the most trustworthy guy but, quite honestly, that’s her problem. Go visit your family, but stay home for the after-dinner festivities. Say you’re too tired to go out. Your loyalty is to your sister. If she’s with an untrustworthy guy, she probably needs all the unconditional love she can get whether she realizes it or not. BTW: In the future, if an engagement ring ever shows up on your sister’s finger from this A-Hole, all bets are off.

Arts and Culture," has earned itself a big shiny spot on the Bushwick gallery map. Through consistently excellent programming, the gallery has proven that their shows are not to be missed.

However, you will get there by very different means. Get ready for a surprising, adventurous journey as your sensors receive a different type of information than what traditional media utilizes.,Garet’s art will occupy your sense of sound and sight with the aim of captivating your consciousness. I suspect that through multiple layers of noise, color and light, the artist manipulates the frequency of your brain waves. He takes you on a fluid journey between the feeling of acuteness and the feeling of quiet. In the quiet you have a chance to experience the space between thoughts, where nothing is worth thinking about and you simply feel a connection with yourself…, , , , ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

A dog run has opened on the north end of Maria Hernandez Park, on Irving and Willoughby.,Dogs and owners are equally excited by the development. “It’s good for them to socialize with other dogs”, says one resident, “it’s good for their temperament.” Charlotte, who owns eleven-year-old Junebug, remarked that prior to the dog park options were very limited. “My friend used to take her dog to the local baseball field, but you had to watch you didn’t get a ticket.”,Even residents who don’t own a dog were impressed with the park’s newest addition. “It’s good that they got their own park”, says one woman, “ ’cause now they don’t do doodoo in ours!” You can’t argue with that logic.,There was lots of roughhousing going on this morning.

Dré chose her signature Lisa Frank cheetah print and turned one of the boring trucks into a travelling sensation!,“I was inspired by the 1983 documentary , about New York street artists and the hip hop culture, ” said Dré while shaking up ,purple color spray. “I love how the street artists painted trains and those would then travel through boroughs. I love the idea of an image going ‘all city,’” she smiled.,While biking around the parking lot of cement trucks on Boerum Street, the idea hit her. She talked to the United Transit Mix Inc. owners Danny and Tony Mastronardi who at first hesitantly but ultimately proudly let her paint one of the trucks. “I told Danny I planned to use very feminine colors and I was a little worried but then I saw him snapping a picture with his phone, and I knew he liked it.”,Dré prepared a mock up in Photoshop, bought a lot of spray paint and black house paint. She used magnetic stencils to create cheetah patches, which we believe is genius.

"Featured,In the Hood","To get a wider view of the Bushwick social engagement action, I talked to a happening bartender who watches people interact socially for a living. I chose ,, a bartender at the bar ,at 253 Bushwick Avenue. Sally likely gets told she reminds people of Scarlett Johansson. She’s been a bartender at various bars in the neighborhood for the past 3 years. I picked Sally to interview because she seems to be a strong, independent young woman with an equally balanced view of men and women. I spoke to her for quite some time before asking her specific questions for this column., Sally is 27. She studied creative writing and acting in college and came to New York, (Bushwick specifically) around 3 years ago from Richmond,Virginia, to pursue her career as a comedic writer/director. She is working on a funny web series and performs at the PIT (People’s Improv Theater) when she’s not making money as a bartender. Sally says that in her time in New York she’s dated a number of guys, and has had 3 relationships. She went on a few OK Cupid dates and stuck with one of them for over 6 months. She’s good at vibing people and when she can, she tries to get some action going at the bar for people who seem interested in pursuing some. On a personal level, she’s professional and says she’s never gone out with someone she’s met while working; she’s not interested in the least. Okay dudes – I challenge you to try to make it happen!,When someone is constantly surveying the room, eyes darting about. Girls tend to fling their hair around, laugh loudly and men might theatrically throw back a shot or stunts. This is all from a specific sample size but you’ll know it when you see it. Someone who is generally restless yet giddy., I think some women try too hard and some men not enough. I think there is probably a law somewhere wherein the number of drinks a women has is directly correlated to a heightening of pitch. Both men and women get louder but the high frequency cackle is physically a concern. Dressing like you have no self-worth and too much make up comes off as trying too hard. Also, women seem to compete with each other. I think two of the most unattractive things you can be is desperate and judgy., The worst mistakes men make are using a tired approach or not approaching at all. Unless you’re super hot and have friends surrounding you validating your every move, chances are a girl is not going to approach you. The best thing you can do is make a little fun of her. This shows you’re not scared and you have a sense of humor. Remember just to tease not offend., , , If you’re looking to hook up with a stranger in a bar, bring your friends. That way at least your target will know you’re not a complete freak. Otherwise a party, show or art event where lots of mutual friends will be is the best bet. As far as how to look, just be your cool self, a well-groomed version unless that’s just not the type of dude you’re looking for., I think most women look for the social leader in the bunch. The cool confident guy that has all the answers or at least doesn’t care if he doesn’t., , One night stands are certainly a lot more common than they used to be and Bushwick along with most of Brooklyn has become very progressive in its views on sexuality. There’s less of it happening, however, than one may think. I know women who boast about their ability to sleep around untouched by emotions and I’ve been able to do the same but I’m not sure anyone prefers it in the long run. In both sexes, at times, it strikes me as a defense mechanism.,
Sally: I can guarantee that if you are confident, truly confident, and playful that it’ll be in the bag for you in no time. Don’t talk shit about other people. Be interesting. Read a book or even a news article before you go out. A quote from my favorite anonymous person goes, “Intelligent people talk about ideas. Average people talk about things. Small people talk about other people.”, I wonder at times what the most appropriate behavior in the presence of an ex is. When you’re the one who’s made the decision to go separate ways I think it’s just as hard as it would be the other way around. You could be questioning if you’ve made the right choice. Then what do you do if you see him with another person at the same social event!? My first instinct is to drag that ho out by her hair, but I just can’t image that that’d be the right course of action., Yes, Sally, hair dragging another girl is never the first course of action. I think breaking up is hard, no matter what end of the equation you’re on. It’s also a big change in your lifestyle, friends and when holidays like Thanksgiving come up, it can affect those times as well, especially if you spent last year’s Thanksgiving together. The most important thing to remember is when you see your ex out with someone else, it’s likely an idealized situation. He’s on his best behavior, probably so is she. Plus, usually it’s in some sort of  social situation, one that’s where people are to have a good time. Not one where he’s being annoying playing video games or not showered in two days. But yes, it’s a painful sight to see your ex with someone else, no matter what, even if you happen to be with another person. You must remind yourself at these times why you broke up with this person. Go right away to that mode; it’s the a good way to get through it. If you start focusing on how much fun you used to have, you may disregard the whole picture, and pile on more unnecessary torture and confusion for yourself., ","Dr. Lisa, S.P., is a self-proclaimed psychotherapist, artist, performer and comedian.

We danced on through British DJ ,, who is most known for his drum’n'bass numbers.

Known for outstanding remixes, but alone renowned for his scathingly original soundscapes that are as complicated at times as they are minimalistic at others.

Gold Panda has the pulsing, flying hands of a musical genious and the twinkle in his eye of a madmen who is trying to make things right. Seeing him live was a transcendental experience, and the absolute highlight of BEMF for me.,Saturday I returned to the madness and to a lot more great music, starting with the remarkable , at Cameo. He had the crowd pumped and going, and for good reason- his beats and samples favor the funky, ushering a whole new realm of dance music.,A quick stop at beloved Public Assembly did not dissapoint- DJ ,was dubbing it up, driving  the crowd nuts and bringing chicks up on stage with him.,Like Friday night, the main event of the night, Nicholas Jaar, was happening that night at Music Hall of Williamsburg.

Those of us who don’t memorize musicians faces were confused, having expected an entirely different type of music. I didn’t even realize the mistake until days afterwards… this disorganization the only disappointment of the fest.,BUT, it was all okay in the end, because I left to catch ,perform in his wild way at Glasslands. He is so much fun to see, bringing all of his spunk, energy, and talent into each performance. His music is most definably glitch-hop, but encorporates a lot of vocal harmonies, spoken-words samples and sunny, ambient noises to a pulsating heart-like beat track.

"Featured,People","Monsters, both in the figurative and literal sense, have been utilized worldwide in cultures for millenniums. Boredom, however, is relatively new to humanity, created by industrialization and fueled into overdrive by digital technology. These two motifs, along with the concept of celebrity, are explored in the form of a sitcom, ,, written, directed and starring video artist Elizabeth Theis, which screened recently at the ,. , is a story about an agoraphobic hypochondriac who believes she is destined to be the next big thing. In her work, Theis often uses themes involving our relationship with media, narcissism, boredom and mortality., from , on ,.,I sat down with her to ask her about her transition from experimental video to comedy.,Well, it wasn’t an intentional transition. My work has always been somewhat of a social commentary, and it’s always had a sort of sardonic humor to it, but I only recently started defining it as comedy. The comedy audience is a lot broader. Though I still love making socially conscious documentaries or experimental films, it can leave you feel like you’re preaching to the choir.,With the show, I’m a member of the group of people that I’m critiquing, and I don’t want to deny that by getting on some intellectual high horse.,Narcissism is definitely something we’ve seen spreading in the past ten years, but each emerging form of media that has been introduced since the oral history has become more about he individual as opposed to the community. When you move from oral culture, storytelling and things like that, to a written culture, it becomes more about the relationship that the individual has with words on paper. From there it becomes further and further fragmented with industrialization and radio. The more choices we have, the more individualistic it becomes, especially now that we can create online personas where we can show the world the way we want to be seen and hide what we don’t want seen. Lizzie represents this modern dilemma and the way we’ve become so immersed in digital technology that we shut the world out and only relate to the world via devices.,I use a lot of analog media, because I want this character to be timeless, at least from the point of industrialization. The concept of boredom is a product of industrialization and modernization. Everything from the mid 19th century to the present is cultivated in the show because it’s all symbolically representing the psyche of boredom, narcissism and individualism. But at the same time it’s a stylistic choice because that’s what I’m attracted to.,I think as an artist some of the decisions you make are just inherent or animalistic in a way and you just do them without realizing what they symbolize until later. With that, a lot of what I’m focusing on I want it to be universal, at least for my Western audience. Everyone has had that night where they’re bored, watching television and something like Home Shopping Network or an infomercial comes on and it’s depressingly mesmerizing. That to me is one of the quintessential American experiences. I wanted to use that as a basis to stem from, all the absurd media that Lizzie Boredom parodies in her hallucinations is a nod to that empty, late-night feeling of being satiated yet unfulfilled.,Without sounding pretentious, I don’t think you choose the thing you’re passionate about – just as you don’t choose the person you fall in love with. There’s just a chemistry once you stumble over it; you find something that makes you feel good and you just keep doing it. I discovered my passion for video during my adolescence, which was pretty broken. My parents divorced and my mother became chronically ill around the time I entered middle school. I became really reclusive and detached myself from the world around me. I was lucky enough to get accepted into a publicly-funded arts high school in a nearby city, to which I owe a debt of gratitude for having saved my life. It was there that I took my first video production and photography classes. I enjoyed how these mediums allowed me to quietly observe and critique the world around me, they gave me a voice. The process of making films was therapeutic and still is today.,Despite the self-centered comments about filmmaking being therapy for me, and despite the fact that I’m writing about an axe murderer, what I really want to do with Lizzie Boredom is relate to people.,But it’s new ground for me. I’ve always been really serious and earnest with my work, and because it’s so grounded in philosophy, I end up isolating people. Humor is more comfortable and allows you to cast a wide net, because you’re exploiting the mundane details of everyday life. I feel like a lot of us are scared of how mysterious life can be, and it’s nice to be able to laugh at how absurd “it all” is. Lizzie Boredom is full of allegory and meaning and philosophy, but I don’t think I need to harp on those in order for people to “get” it. As long as they’re laughing, they’ve got it., will be screening at the , at New School University on December 7.","Eric Nelson is a fiction writer, freelancer and curator living in Ridgewood Queens.","Bushwick,Bushwick Film Festival,Elizabeth Theis,Killing time with Lizzie Boredom,video art","

In the Hood," ,Here in Bushwick we were very blessed to have been very lucky in regards to the relative hardships from the storm. One stressful area that might not be as obvious: the tension this type of disaster can bring to relationships, especially for couples that aren’t living together. Having to decide who goes to who’s home and when can be difficult to navigate during the mass transit shutdowns (read L train). We all know it’s nothing compared to what some people are trying to manage, but it can be legitimately upsetting to say the least.,Well, to say the least, if it is true, your girlfriend is pretty disorganized. Do you feel like she hasn’t been completely honest about other things—does she tell her friends the truth or do you notice her ease with a flexible truth?,Either way, a girl who runs from disaster and brings leather lingerie sounds like a lot of fun. But someone who cannot keep track of her own underwear may not be ready for a serious relationship. Are you sure a relationship is what you want, too? Or are you just drawn to something that you can’t quite have? People subconsciously choose people they can’t really have because they don’t want a commitment themselves.,It doesn’t sound to me like you totally trust this lady. The more important part of this equation is you—make sure you’re not distracting yourself by getting tied up with someone who is out of reach, unless you know you’re choosing to do so., , It’s hard to say for sure, but in this case I would take the high road and give him the benefit of the doubt and stay out of his way. If his work and career are dependent upon using his laptop from home, this could be tougher for him than you realize. He may be trying to keep up with his business, not wanting to let his clients think he can’t deliver. Neediness is never attractive. Stay busy. If you need something to do, volunteer: that will surely impress him and make you feel better. In the meantime, try to discipline your brain not to think about him—and staying away until he’s back on track is the best thing you can do for the relationship. When he does get in touch next time, be sure to focus on his needs, not your neediness. Be fun and upbeat. And if after all this, he does want some space, at least the L train will be running by then; There are more dudes all along the way., , ,See you next week!,

And, if you’ve been off work and trapped in the borough like many Brooklynites, you’ve probably been looking for opportunities to help. We , by , and volunteering, and it’s amazing what a huge feedback we have received.  On Friday I volunteered with a group of eager young Brooklynites from the mostly-untouched Williamsburg/Bushwick/Park Slope areas who simply wanted to help as much as possible. ,After gathering an astonishing amount of goods in a one-day donation drive, almost 50 people showed up at relief headquarters and neighborhood haunt , to make 1000+ sandwiches, snacks, and organize goods at 8 am. From there, we set off in 6+ cars to the , that was hit hard and remains mostly without power.,Once we reconvened at a set of huge buildings in Canarsie, we set to work communicating with the Russian volunteers and community members who were already organizing aid. We sorted our goods into “emergency packs”- bags including water, canned and non-perishable goods, toilet paper, toiletries, and assorted other goods.,Our next priority was to find out who was still living in the neighboring buildings. These massive complexes, 23 stories high and lined up like century-old giants right along Ocean Parkway, had been evaculated leading up to the storm. Many residents, especially elderlies, chose to stay, without another safe place to relocate to, or physically unable to leave.,We began by combing through the pitch-black powerless buildings in small teams, knocking on each door, calling out that we had food, water, and help. We were told to call out the Russian words for food and water, as many residents spoke no English at all. We were also told to speak clearly, gently, and helpfully because many people inside were afraid of opening their doors in fear of being looted or robbed. Most residents we came across were scared and lonely but extremely grateful for our help. We wrote down specific requests for goods and sent teams to gather exactly what they had asked for.,Upon returning we we handed out our most requested items- , Many apartments were dark and would only become darker as night wore on, so we provided extra candles. We were thanked with kind words, many in Russian, kisses, and even tears. Many of these people, some appearing in their late 80s, were physically unable to leave their apartments to walk up or down stairs, and had already run out of their Hurricane provisions.,It was wonderful to be able to help these people in need, as we passed the information of who was remaining in the building on to the community volunteers who will hopefully followup with more food and provisions. These buildings are expected to remain without power for up to two weeks.,The mission was a good example of DIY volunteering. You can make a difference without all of the “red tape” that comes along with The Red Cross’ specific volunteer programming.

You’ll have to wait out everyone else to the end of the party though, and you might run out of energy by then—a burrito will likely distract you from any human no matter how appetizing., Jessica’s costume, a hurricane inspired windblown ensemble, was smart, of the moment  and all business.

He’s flaunting drugs, but it’s done in an intellectual, not in a visceral way, so it’s hard to tell what his point of view is.

In the Hood,"To strangers who asked if we were mother and daughter I replied, “We are friends”. We are contemporaries, members of a mutual admiration society.,I introduced myself to Katarina after the 1/19/12 Bogart Salon , panel to thank her for the Bushwick Daily coverage of my exhibit , at ,. Effervescent Katarina was enthusiastic when I told her about my plans to walk every street in Bushwick for my series in progress ,. I suggested we go photographing in Bushwick together sometime, and we did this summer.,What a duo. One, a life long New Yorker, came to Bushwick in 1981 to teach art. Constantly taking photos throughout a 31-year public school teaching career (14 in Bushwick) that were stored away. Decades later sifts through to discover diamonds in the rough, polishes each facet carefully to begin exhibiting the gems. The other came from Eastern Europe to NY a few years ago to study (and then abandon) law and two years ago decides to photograph and write about Bushwick and put it out there on the web on a daily basis.  What we share is a fascination with NYC, Bushwick in particular, everyday people and events. I sense we share an awe for the role of photography in art and society.,What do two people walking and photographing Bushwick chat about? A little shop talk: I ask her advice about using my new camera on the manual setting. She inquires about my philosophy/ways of street photography- asking to take photos versus capturing the action anonymously. What are the answers to these burning questions on a beautiful summer day? Katarina uses the manual setting or the aperture priority mode. I usually ask permission before photographing. Both of us use fixed lenses (not zoom), she a 50mm (normal lens) and I a 35mm (slightly wide). Enough tech talk- on to ice cream. I suggest gelato at Circos and she suggests we go to Maria Hernandez Park to eat it up. The sole defined destination was to head up to Palmetto Street where I used to teach, and back again to Wilson at the end of the day to get her bike locked up in front of Storefront Bushwick. Our eyes and feet led us wayfaring through the streets.,Some photographers think going shooting with another is awkward or competitive- getting in each other’s way or “ruining/stealing the shot”. Artists, like children, often struggle with sharing. Recently I led a , with ,. On both occasions photographing together was pure joy, a work out for the feet and camaraderie that enhanced the journey.

"Featured,Mind and Body","“People don’t do enough rituals these days,” said , in her cozy studio on Troutman Street in Bushwick. “And if they do, it’s to reaffirm the old, like celebrating Christmas or Hanukkah. The rituals I design for people are meant to invite something new to their lives; to help them manifest their destiny.”,“Wow! Bushwick is becoming a mecca for spiritual wisdom,” I thought to myself. Only a couple of weeks ago I interviewed inner wisdom coach ,, and now I was invited to , of Emily Tepper who was talking exactly my language. Emily Tepper is a petite energetic woman with an interesting career path. From professional dancing, through a masters program in behavioral design, and years of teaching pilates, she has recently decided to open her own studio, here in Bushwick.  Emily is set to serve her community through pilates, craniosacral massage and experience design. Let’s look at how these three parts of her practice relate to each other and why is having Emily in Bushwick so excellent.,“What makes pilates a spiritual experience?” you are probably asking right now. “Well, pilates allows for the perfect control over your body,” says Emily who has been teaching pilates for over 15 years.  “You’re like a sculptor of your own body,” she smiles. Emily promises that you can have the body you have always wanted. Yes, exactly , body. Emily teaches pilates one on one, using pilates machine and different tools to perform exactly that one specific, subtle move that she wants you to perform. Even if you don’t have any experience with pilates, Emily will make sure you are doing it exactly right. While exercising, you will be perfectly concentrated on a particular muscular activity, and you will be very present in your own body – this is in fact synonymous to mediation. So while you are working on your body, your mind is working as well. I personally found it interesting that, thanks to pilates, Emily discovered some imbalances in my muscles and bones, which I acquired due to bad habits when running. It is totally empowering to be able to listen to what your body has to say because, trust me, it talks to you. We just forget how to listen.,Craniosacral massage was a very mysterious part of my experience with Emily, and I had virtually no idea what to expect. Well, let me tell you that craniosacral massage works with energy and can be pretty intense. Belonging to alternative methods of medicine, Emily will place her hands on different parts of your body and will pay particular attention to your neck and head. Craniosacral therapy relieves stress, neck and back pain. Through the focused treatment Emily was able to name a couple of my emotional issues, quite precisely.,I find the ritual design to be the most interesting part of Emily Tepper’s practice.  In fact, I am completely fascinated by it.,Emily says that a ritual serves as a ribbon cutting ceremony for turning a new page in your life. A ritual can break a negative habit and move you out of negative repeating loops in your life. A ritual can help you solve a problem. “My clients have experienced profound changes in their lives following their ritual,” said Emily. She will even give you your money back if the things don’t change for you within three months. So how does that work? Emily will discuss a problem or an issue that you’re currently facing in your life; it will typically be something that you don’t feel is going in compliance with how you imagined it. Emily is very good in articulating the problems, and soon you will see a very clear analysis of what’s going on with you. I found this phase particularly nice because the problem that previously seemed too huge to handle suddenly became something manageable. Most importantly, Emily will make it clear to you that you’re not the only person in the world dealing with a particular matter. It feels good to see that us humans are so similar.,The ritual itself consists of some action that feels a little bit on the edge, but also feels doable. Remember, it has to be something you don’t do every day, in order to feel extraordinary and life changing. Emily will pick something that relates to the medium you work with if you’re an artist, or something else that is deeply connected to the core of yourself. You will symbolically break the pattern, release yourself from the problem and begin the life you would like to live. Symbols are powerful language of your subconscious mind, and so a ritual like this may trigger amazing experiences for you…,As for my own ritual, it related to fear and letting go of my past that was holding me back. I felt a little hesitant and even silly when the day of the ritual arrived, but Emily was on the phone encouraging me to go with it. I did, and I must say the euphoria that followed was priceless. Has anything changed in my life? Yes, it has! Have I lost my fear forever? I hope so. In any case, a ritual will empower you to face and get rid of your problems - and Emily Tepper will be there for you.","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

In the Hood,"The predominating social sexual structure is that women and dudes meet, hookup, move on, and repeat. No hard feelings! Is this kind of readily available sex a good thing? I took to the streets this week to find out how people in Bushwick feel about the dynamics between men and women.,As a pretend therapist I hypothesize that this mostly works great for the appropriately not-ready-to settle-down age group, but I believe that underneath it all there is some defensiveness and fear of rejection. See what people said to me and then weigh in with your own opinion. . . ., ,I asked The Anonymous Man, 25, DJ and party promoter, if he ever gets hung up on any of the girls he hooks up with and ends up wanting to see them again. I seemed to jog his memory and he went through a short list in his head of women he’d been thinking of calling. The way he described it, I imagined little slips of paper scattered around his apartment left by various women. “I feel like if I ask a girl out for drinks, she’s more likely to want to go than if I ask her out for dinner, like dinner is too much of a commitment. I guess I don’t really trust women that much. When I first moved here from upstate, I think I trusted people too much,” he said., When I asked Jeffrey, 22, about the state of ,sexual relations in Bushwick, he told me, “There’s an abundance of beautiful people here. People that come here are very ambitious about their careers and don’t have time to pursue relationships.”,I asked Jeffrey if he ever feels like he gets hung up on a girl he’s slept with—he said he doesn’t have that problem.,“What happens if a woman gets hung up on you?” I asked.,“I take a step back,” he said. “I’ll wait a few days and maybe see her again. That way she’ll understand that I don’t want to make this such a regular thing and get the message that I’m not looking for a relationship.”, Moving on to a discussion I had with two ladies that I’ll refer to as Entrepreneur #1, age 27, and Entrepreneur #2, age25, where I’d say I got a feel for the take-charge attitude of women in Bushwick.  I got the feeling that they, like me, think that a lot of people are self-protective out here, emotionally that is, but not when it comes to condom use. They both complained about dudes’ condom etiquette. GUYS, WRAP IT UP BEFORE YOU HAVE TO BE ASKED. It gives women pause when you don’t automatically use condoms. They each shared a few war stories, both fun and not so fun, about hooking up in Bushwick. Entrepreneur #2 had been sleeping with a guy somewhat regularly for about six months. When it came time to find out what was going on and she asked directly, the response she got was disappointing and she regretted wasting time by not acting sooner.,Entrepreneur #1 says, “Take control and be direct.”  Entrepreneur #2 strongly advises, “Know what you want going in. Don’t hook up with someone and then later say that you want a relationship. If you want a relationship, then know that. And if you don’t, be clear about that as well.” I’d say the message here is speak up!,I’d love to hear your take on this topic. Post your thoughts here or send me an e-mail.,Thanks so much!

Arts and Culture,"Born in Argentina, raised in Brazil, Guillermo Creuss currently resides in Bushwick. Guillermo originally came to New York to pursue his career in painting, although these days you are more likely to come across his curated art shows than his own work. And most importantly, you are very likely to come across his online gallery ,. ,Guillermo has been immersed in curating since 2009, when he curated his first art show on the second floor of 56 Bogart building. “I think that being an artist is a good asset for a curator,” says Guillermo, who as a foreigner has more or less successfully battled the English language and titled the first show Fortress to Solitude, instead of Fortress of Solitude. The name with a cute mistake stuck, and created a brand for months to follow. “As a curator I opened my eyes to the large amount of work which is in the neighborhood and also worldwide. That wasn’t the case when I was focused on my own work in my studio,” said Guillermo.,For a couple of months in 2010-2011, Guillermo was able to use an unoccupied building on Boerum Street. While the owner was trying to obtain the missing paperwork, Guillermo was curating eclectic shows there and inviting artists and gallerists from the area. Simultaneously with the realization that he would prefer to curate art shows in multiple spaces came the owner’s decision to take the building back. Fortress to Solitude was put on hiatus – but not for too long. “I have been a web designer for many years, and so the online thing made a lot of sense to me,” said Guillermo. The online platform of Fortress to Solitude was launched in June 2012. “The works on the website took much longer I than expected,” says Guillermo. In November 2012 they had a WordPress site, but another web developer came along later on and developed the site from scratch to create its current version.,Looking at the enormous international reach of Fortress to Solitude as an online platform (the gallery contains art from Bushwick, Brazil, Berlin, Copenhagen and more), one has to ask: Will the traditional galleries be replaced with online spaces? Or will they coexist as two modes fulfilling similar purposes?,Fortress to Solitude currently offers archival prints, which is a model that was successfully adopted by Jen Bekman and her 20×200 project. “The internet has made it possible for people to have visual access to art, and being able to afford low cost but high quality archival prints is amazing,” said Guillermo.,
“However, Fortress to Solitude is a little bit more exclusive than other websites. We do limited editions of about 25 pieces. All of them are signed and numbered, printed locally, in the best quality.”,
This process incorporated a lot of photographers and digitally created works, but Fortress to Solitude plans to also offer works on paper and unique pieces in the future, still at affordable prices.,So what do you think? Can you imagine your art being featured in an online gallery? If your answer is yes, than soon you will have a chance as Fortress to Solitude plans an open call for new artists, likely in partnership with a Bushwick art institution., , ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

"Featured,Music"," ,Days after the brutal, sleep-deprived, over-boozed, and numb-eardrumming end to CMJ, our concert experiences are still rolling in. Deadlines? PSSSHHHH.

It was an eruption of loud music, crazy dancers, $2 beers, and all-around Bushwick rowdiness. Oh, and an incredible rooftop. I now want to do this every weekend.,In case you’ve never heard of ,, it’s a basement venue in an apartment on Stockholm street. The 4-room apartment is connected to the beautiful loft building. There’s a similar venue next door, called ,, that also hosts shows. So rad.,I arrived in time to hear ,breaking the speed of sound downstairs. Heary, garage-layered punk rock, with emotional yelps for vocals, they tore through their set which the crowd bodyslammed., were up next.

Their always venue- filling afro-punk rock sound bounced through the basement like a bouncy ball, sneaking up on unsuspecting dance victims, who jumped on stage to shake it with Osekre.,Neighborhood favorites ,took over the airwaves next, bringing with them a bevvy of dancing ladies and a whole lotta sweaty dudes. Jangula is an intricate, melody-driven punk rock band with ritualistic lyrics. These friends have been together playing for years, but their passionate stage energy never gets old while their music jangles its way to extraordinary life.,I had to take a break from the sweaty, smokey downstairs to peer out on the amazing rooftop.

"Featured,Opinion","My involvement with , started over a year ago when a proposal I had for a public art project in India led to my first meeting with Peter Hopkins at Life Café in Alphabet City. Anyone who has had a chance to converse with Peter can imagine how I left that first meeting. At age 56 he had more energy, and enthusiasm than anyone I had ever met. We talked for 2 hours, about the art world, India, Detroit and more. We talked about possibilities, not anger or fear. Days after it slowly struck me! I had just met an art world “YES!” person. “Yes” you can make new ideas happen, “Yes” the art world is melting down, but seize the moment as an opportunity, and do not waste your time working on small things, or seeking approval from small people. It made me realize that up until this point that was the attitude that led to the realization of my curatorial projects and my co-founding a non-profit, ,. It turned out that I had met Peter at the right moment. At that time I still entertained the thought that I might possibly be a little crazy to think my life’s motto was – ‘ do something to make a difference.’ I was still confronted by individuals frightened into submission by the old order and the economic crisis. Those people would speak of “risk” and “creativity,” but were more concerned about not appearing “wrong” than they are about what the “new” might actually look like.,There were many reasons that got me deeply involved with citydrift. First and foremost, it was the fact that this was an experiment towards enabling two essential factors – connectivity and collaboration. Networking and careful building of relationships in the art world are not new. However, oftentimes my previous art world experience led me to believe that the process was not open enough. We are taught to be fearful and constantly in a competitive mode – let’s not even go into egos that constantly come in the way. citydrift is an attempt to counter these notions. Its philosophical underpinning, based on the idea of the , or drift, facilitates an experiment towards an open, giving, non-hierarchical, inclusive event. An event that embodies what the ‘new’ cultural model should look like. How can we create a premise where everyone – artists, poets, urban planners, writers, students and your mom – can can engage in a dialogue to truly find a cultural model that is accessible, sustainable and takes us beyond discussing the “death of” or the “crisis in” galleries, museums, cultural institutions, or on a broader scale, cultural production?,One of the key aspects of citydrift is that it’s a replicable event that takes place just one time in a particular part of the world. One that is never an imposition but rather a dialog that will be unique to the city, culture, time and space that it takes place in. We aren’t taking citydrift/bushwick to Detroit or India but enabling citydrift/detroit and citydrift/india with its own unique set of social, political and cultural circumstances. As it travels, the idea is to not impose a structure or a model but function as an enabler, for both local and international communities within a broad scope of creative and non-creative industries. Both established as well as emerging entities are able to come together and discuss the future of cultural production in that city/country, and set up the impetus to follow through with it.,This is something I started to do with Peter on a different scale with another project ,. Both citydrift and Isha have effectively brought people from every walk of life to collaborate in telling a story. To engage not on a superficial level, but through what Randy Pausch, in his famous The Last Lecture, calls “Head Fake.”  Pausch explained that if one wanted to play football, it’s not about learning “the three point stance or how to read a play. Football teaches players things like Teamwork, Sportsmanship, Perseverance…etc.” citydrift was that game. The rules were that there were no rules. For me personally it reaffirmed the fact that creating events/projects like citydrift or Isha is the new way forward – it’s what cultural entrepreneurship should look like.,We have to create a space (physical, digital or collectively connective) that generates and enables experiences that will alter and re-wire the way we think of culture and what we want it to look like in the future alongside with some specific art world models like exhibitions. This model is also a business model, which is more in line with social entrepreneurship than pure non profit or for-profit set ups. And that is what I am working towards becoming – a cultural entrepreneur.,As an Indian immigrant woman I have had to fight just to get a foothold here in the States, staying on the right Visa while paying off huge loans, but something in me is simply wired for entrepreneurship. What I see around me is cultural replication and this notion of “credibility” lent through an established Western cultural institution.  For example, the opening up of a “branch” of the Guggenheim or Louvre. This has been done in countries that sought to build themselves an “international” or supposedly “global” cultural identity. Where is the authenticity in that? Isn’t authenticity what we should be striving towards?,I have seen this striving for authenticity, this drive to just go do what needs to be done and the success of it in the work Katarina Hybenova is doing through ,, for instance. It is an interesting model that combines various forms of media online – be it the blog, a radio or an online gallery alongside specific physical exhibitions – and is very invested in defining the Bushwick cultural identity. And Hybenova’s approach like Hopkins’ is fun, inclusive and connective.,I also saw this real authenticity on a recent trip to Detroit, the city that will see citydrift’s second iteration later next year. Through Peter, who has been planning this event there for over two years, I met with the couple Tim White-Sobieski and Tate Olsten, who literally drove across the U.S. without a final destination in mind, and who didn’t see Detroit as ruin and desperation but as opportunity and hope. With monies borrowed and raised over the past 4 years, they have been working literally by hand to build Kunsthalle Detroit (kunsthalledetroit.org). They bought an abandoned bank and employed a local handyman, Al. Al was out of a job and basically homeless when he just happened to walk by one day while they were at the space. Since then he has been singlehandedly supervising reconstruction along with Tim and Tate., I also met artist Gregory Holm, who is based between Detroit and Brooklyn. Greg bought a space and he has been working to rebuild it with other artists, not only from Detroit but from as far as Puerto Rico. They are collaboratively working towards turning this property close to Eastern Market into a multi-experiential space. It will be a bakery, an inn and much more. He is focused on opening up the space not only to artists and to art world visitors but to his Bangladeshi neighbor who “could enjoy a coffee while perhaps a dancer interprets a carefully crafted meal”.,This kind of cultural entrepreneurship is the way forward. To do it in cities like Detroit is the key as well. To go out there and buy some of those abandoned homes is entirely possible if you are enterprising enough and willing to take big risks, and, yes, hustle if you must.,I wonder what stops artists from moving to Detroit for instance? Why must the “action” be within the context of New York alone? Why must it be performative within the context of what the art world defines as social, political or performative? Why might it not be “performative” in the way Greg’s Inn or Tim and Tate’s Kunsthalle projects are to my mind?,And this brings me to a key aspect of citydrift that was pretty much what Katarina, Tim, Tate and Greg have been doing intuitively – this idea of “letting go,” taking big risks and embracing the idea of failure. Because Failure is the most difficult thing to experience, yet the most important quality to develop as a cultural entrepreneur. At the project level in Bushwick, I saw that while it was easy for a lot of the drifters to “let go” during the specific time of drifting – all of that vanished when artist presentations were being made the following day. It changed into individual artist presentations rather than discussing and sharing what the drifts themselves meant or did for everyone. My intention here is not to pinpoint or put down artist presentations as a bad thing, but it just wasn’t what citydrift sought to enable. This was perhaps the “failure” within citydrift. And that was perfect.,I think it’s this fear instilled right from when you get into our education system that makes it so difficult to “let go.” It’s a notion that has been drilled into our heads: If we work in an ”art world” job it helps us to connect and helps our career move in one direction – Up. But then when we do fight for getting a better pay or getting a pay at all within the current institutional and funding structures, I wonder if we are beating a dead horse?,I actually value my art market oriented education because within the program I learned how the world works. And believe me, it took me some time to put those things into perspective. I didn’t come out of the program with an idealistic point of view. Neither did I lose real world perspective of how things work – the biases, the politics, the fact that I’m a brown woman and that will matter whether I like it or not. I came without a trust fund but with a massive loan, as I mentioned earlier, like many others. However, I also learned that money is not a dirty word. And that’s huge. I also believe that artists are essentially entrepreneurs and that they should start to look at themselves that way. Embrace it. Because personally, I’m interested in how one can channel the industriousness of most cultural producers into something concrete and mutually beneficial. As a creative community we are enterprising by nature. Yet it is a bizarre relationship with money and an addiction to whining constantly about how the whole world is against us that often leads us to underestimating the power that we possess.  The power to re-think what cultural production and its infrastructure/models/institutions of the future can look like and how it can be sustainable, profitable and socially conscious., ","Meenakshi Thirukode is a writer, curator and artist based in NYC.

Music,"What can I say about the re-vamped , that I couldn’t say about the former Party Expo?  Well, there’s a chandelier.  And the walls are black!  Matte black. As if everything was covered in gaffer’s tape.  There’s a pool table.  There’s what I would describe as a clear “standing-pod” off to one side, in which you could stand if the mood struck.  But most importantly, there’s large bar running the length of the left wall.  That’s a huge improvement for anyone who visited the old Party Expo in it’s waning prohibition days, a time when patrons were viciously foo-fooed for BYOBing but then fuck it you’ve already bought a six pack of tall cans so like secret frat boys or teens at a Young Life retreat you periodically sneak off to the bathroom to shotgun a can or two. ,Tonight, the guy at the door was nice enough to lay a couple drink tickets on me so I hit the bar first.  Glancing around back there for the beer selection I can’t help but notice the prominent microwave / toaster oven setup whose use was to remain unclear throughout the night.  Remembering the folding sign out front said something about beer and shot I order that. Dude hands me a Rolling Rock (kudos, no joke I love RR) and a little cup of what seems like vodka but what I later learn to be Soju, a low proof Korean liquor that’s a creative if not very tasty way around not having a proper liquor license. So I’m all set.  I know where I am, I have a drink, and I’ve been so caught up in the microwave/pod vibe I hardly noticed there’s a band playing.,I tune in for a minute but it sounds like stripped down late period nu-metal or something that could come out on a compilation CD next to Powerman 5000 so I don’t necessarily want to.  I try to take a look at the stage hoping for some visual inspiration, but my view from the bar is blocked by a cowboy hat.,I rule out a potential western-wear resurgence when I realize this guy’s prolly 50 and not in a “I’m 50 and cause I did too much acid I now live in Bushwick” kinda way.  More like a dad 50 kinda way.  Broadening my scope to the crowd it seems like somebody invited their whole family.  Over yonder you got hippie pants mom and creepy vest uncle.  This one guy with a receding pony tail is vibing with a notably kinetic and earnest dance and when I look back in front of me cowboy hat dad is going all bobble head.  This is probably the most genuine enthusiasm I’ve seen at a Brooklyn venue in a while, especially during the early ‘text your friends and update Facebook’ part of the night.  Highly refreshing fare.,The aged audience wasn’t a huge surprise since I knew the bill included ,.  There’s a video on their website where you could determine as much about their fan base. Wharton himself was born in 1953, but seeing him you wouldn’t know that: dude has been blessed with that Iggy Pop been there done (all) that but somehow youthful complexion.  There could be a bit of the fan boy clouding my judgement as well.  While I can’t verify the musical resume of cowboy dad, I know Wharton Tiers engineered and produced some massive records out of his now defunct Fun City Studios.  Notables include early Sonic Youth, all the Dinosaur Jr. records that you care about, Helmet’s punishing 90s output, and multiple works with composer Glenn Branca.  That’s the shortlist; , is huge and warrants further investigation.,The ensemble takes the stage around 11PM.  Maybe he does this at every show, but it feels spontaneous when he sets up his drums at the front of the stage with his back facing the audience.  He’s got the kit setup in about 2 minutes, and watches with a congenial puppet master’s smile as his acolytes assemble in a ring before him.  There are 4 guitarists and a bass player, all of whom are rapt in brow furrowed tuning and plugging.  Earlier sets in the evening (like a lot of sets in 2012) were laced with backing tracks and short on musicians, so it feels almost theatrical to see so many people on stage.  Taking them as a crew, I instantly think…bookstore employees!  It’s an apt description.  They seem like highly educated outsiders, bound together by a certain camaraderie, who are all wearing relatively baggy jeans.,The band launches into a tight, driven groove that sounds like a punked up version of the ,, and  whatever the group lacks in sharp style they make up for in performative flare. There’s this one searing chick with a cool Berlin haircut and hot red SG who’s got the perfect power straddle.  One guy with long hair (if this were a bookstore he’d be the D&D fanatic) has a whole arsenal of gape mouthed rock faces and well timed hollers.  The bass player hitting notes with little Pete Townsend flourishes and hopping around Wharton’s drum set.  Just to see 5 people on guitars without shame or pressure of being the alone on stage, totally “rocking” in their own distinct styles is pure entertainment.   And like any good drummer, Wharton spends his arms akimbo and constantly head banging.  He’s super solid, and he owns every aspect of this group.  After a few songs it really begins to sink in that this is an engineer’s band.  Hearing the mix of 4 guitars on 4 different amps and is like hearing the live version of a , record.  There’s a really snappy electricity that demands attention.,This is an “un” CMJ showcase but when Wharton wraps up and headliners , take the stage in their black centric, beautifully styled outfits I start to feel the potential “buzz” cloud amassing within me.  The band is great.  The guitarist plays squelching noise leads over a really solid backbone.  But in the wake of the purity of the Wharton Tiers experience, I’m left feeling like any approach to them would be too whorishly CMJ to be appropriate.,A couple songs in and it’s getting late now for a Tuesday, after 1AM anyway, late for a show.  The old folks have mostly cleared out and made way for lone, wandering men in leather jackets.  The desperate wolf desire is thick, leaping out towards these girls.  I’m getting creeped out and anyway Rolling Rock and Soju doesn’t make a very good dinner.  Hungry and with no word on the mysterious toaster oven, which would finally come in handy, I’m homeward bound., ","Matthew Sanders started hating music in 2010.

Here is our list of worthwhile things to do in LIC, from museums, to parks, to recreation., ,This 19th century schoolhouse holds some of the most current art available in NYC; it is one of the oldest (and largest) nonprofit contemporary art institutions in the US, founded in 1971. Various kinds of new and experimental art in all media are displayed throughout the space, and MOMA PS1 considers itself more of an exhibition space, rather than a “collecting institution.” As indicated by its name, PS1 is affiliated with the Museum of Modern Art.,Each summer, PS1 launches their weekly “Warm Up,” a music (often DJs) and dance extravaganza held in the courtyard of the museum, surrounded by the winner of the “Young Architects Program,” usually in the form of a large scale art piece that consumes the place. Inside is the newly opened ,, the creation of Sarah Obraitis and Hugue Dufour of M. Wells Diner fame, and probably the best place in the borough for , prepared food and other culinary delights., (,),This museum is devoted entirely to the works of the acclaimed sculptor and artist, Isamu Noguchi. The space has a solid, industrial feel to it, as it originally was a former printmaking plant and gas station. Noguchi’s work with stone is what many expect to see here, but there are also drawings, designs, and works with metal.,Docent-led tours are available, and on Wednesday through Sunday, Japanese language tours are available (call to reserve). The museum also produces various ,, including First Fridays (in the Summer and Fall, admission is pay-what-you-wish, there’s a cash bar, and the museum is open late), Second Sundays (dialogues with experts), and a variety of live music performance, from jazz to world music.

The SculptureCenter was originally founded in 1928, and is “a not-for-profit arts institution dedicated to experimental and innovative developments in contemporary sculpture. [They] commission new work and present exhibits by emerging and established, national and international artists.”,The Center’s interior space is 6,000 square feet, and they also have a 3,000 square foot outdoor exhibition space. Exhibitions and events happen throughout the year., (,),This arts non-profit is “dedicated to promoting contemporary visual arts to a broad public audience.” They strive to help the public understand and appreciate contemporary art through dialogue. This is a special place for curators, too, as they are given the opportunity to highlight artists they deem important in the world’s contemporary art scene.,By visiting, you’ll not only get a taste of contemporary art, you’ll also have the chance to understand how the curator came to choose the particular pieces in front of you, as well as read their thoughts about the works in the illustrated brochure provided by the Gallery., (,),Housed in a former parachute harness factory, this private foundation is home to the contemporary art collection of Emily Fisher Landau. She is a philanthropist who, starting in the early 1960s, purchased may of the pieces in the collection from artists early in their careers – some of those artists include Andy Warhol, Cy Twombly, and Robert Rauschenberg.,The museum itself was designed by Max Gordon (designer of the Saatchi Collection in London) with Bill Katz, who is the curator of the collection. The mid-century furniture in the Center is designed by Warren McArthur. The exhibition space takes up three floors, and on each floor you’ll find a staff member happy to help guide you through the immediate collection., (,),This non-profit arts center “supports and promotes emerging artists through exhibitions, commissions, residencies, and collaborative opportunities.” It serves as an “incubation and laboratory space for the creation of artworks” and collaboration is an important part of that process.,Flux Factory runs a residency program for artists, produces major exhibits a year, as well as numerous smaller ones yearly, including open studios. They have also produced a number of classes and workshops that anyone can take, as well as monthly salons, lectures, film-screenings, and receptions for visitors to the center., (,)",,,"

Another possible scenario could be that your fiancé was planning on marrying someone with a job, and now that you’re in transition, he may be acting out with his partying. Or he may simply not be ready to settle down the way it sounds like you are. Also, bear in mind that losing a job can wreck havoc on one’s self-esteem and you may not have the strength in the relationship that you had previously, and he may be (hopefully unwittingly) taking advantage of your TEMPORARY stumble.,Remember, there’s nothing necessarily wrong with his wanting to go out a lot drinking, it’s just that it sounds like you don’t want to be married to that, and the mom in me says, “Good!” Get the deposit back. I’m not saying you have to call this relationship off, but the job-loss dust has to settle. Remember, all jobs are temporary, but marriage is (hopefully) forever.,See you next week Bushwick!,-Dr. Lisa","Dr. Lisa, S.P., is a self-proclaimed psychotherapist, artist, performer and comedian.

Arts and Culture,"In the past couple of weeks we checked out a bunch of shows in Bushwick and beyond. We would like to particularly mention four excellent galleries, their current and upcoming shows: Theodore:ART, Inter State, Bull and Ram and Regina Rex.,At ,, it was all Barclays Arena protest talk. In a very timely manner, Stephanie Theodor curated a solo show of Peter Krashes who also happens to be one of her yearlong favorite artists. Peter Krashes is a painter and a civic activist, for whom protesting and his artistic practice come together in a natural unity. In his works he repeatedly analyzes the role of media in a protest, the means of protest and engagement of the local residents., , ,, a gallery of Tom Weinrich’s, has made a big move over the summer and changed its location from 56 Bogart to 66 Knickerbocker. Tom worked really hard to make a raw warehouse into a pristine white gallery. The good news is that the quality of the art hasn’t changed at all, and it’s traditionally great. ,, a solo show of Cheon pyo Lee examines questions of medium and genre.

That way the photo can be a little more natural where subject is not feeling my presence,” says Johnny about his selection of gear.,Johnny says that he has never had bad a experience shooting on Bushwick streets.

People,"While walking down Forrest Street during this past summer, I’d often see an open garage door. Inside was a man in bright shorts with a large, black beard with many paintbrushes. He’d usually be standing near a wall working on a tapestry filled with fantastical nude creatures.,On occasion I’d stop by to see how they were coming along. Sometimes he’d be meticulously working in the borders. Once, while repeating a floral pattern he turned to me and said, “I can’t believe I started doing this to myself. These borders take a lot.”,“They’re worth it though.”,“Yeah, I’m finding things along the way that enhance the paintings.”,We chatted for a while and I asked if I could record a conversation., My name is ,. I’m an artist from Florida and have been living and working in Bushwick for the past seven years. I do paintings on scrolls and I make ,., What brought you here?, Well I grew in a small town and there wasn’t much there for a painter of dirty drawings. I wound up moving into , Gallery pretty soon after moving here. That was how I met people around here. I was painting there and I got involved with the gallery and started showing with them., Was your work similar to what you’re doing now?, No at that time I was doing these rough – crude drawings with crayons. This series started in the past four years.,I was in the hospital and they removed my ball, my testicle. I painted on the bed sheet there. It was sort of in this style too, I had a pen and watercolors and put the color on top of the drawings.,I was in there for two weeks and was bored. I wanted to do something so I started painting. When I got out, I started looking for a fabric that was similar to the bed sheets so I could keep the kind of washy, watercolor-and-pen style., What happened to the sheet?, I took it., Would you say that having your testicle removed was the thing that changed your art or was it having all that time in the hospital to yourself?, It made me think about things a bit… It definitely influenced me. It did something to me, but I don’t know what… Maybe it was my bad ball and I had to lose it.,My art was already slightly perverted so it went along with it. Sort of streamlined the , [laughs]., When did you start showing with English Kills?, Maybe two years after they opened. I moved in and was just around for a while., How many shows have you been in, in the past year?, I don’t know. A lot of group shows. I haven’t done a solo show in a while. This studio project is sort of a show, but it was also a studio space that I was getting. It was for Bushwick Open Studios and it opened for that., How long do you expect to be here?, Until October. I’d love to keep it longer. But it’s such an open space with the garage door that it may not be the most ideal space in the winter., With the garage door open, a lot of people probably swing by. Does it affect your work?, I love having people come by. It’s a nice distraction for a minute. People will just kind of wander by and come in. That’s how we did this interview today.,I like that. I enjoy it a lot., I saw that Loren Munk stopped by., Yeah, he’s cool. He stopped by, checked out what I was doing and took a picture. Then moseyed along on his bike., The first time I saw your work in person was during the last Beat Nite. There was a twenty – or so – foot long tapestry hanging in English Kills. How did you tackle that piece?, That was an old painting from a solo show at the gallery. I was using a friend’s studio and unrolled the whole thing in it, because he had just moved in and wasn’t completely utilizing it yet. I painted that one in about a week, I didn’t have much time to do it.,I wanted to see what would happen if I did a huge scroll. What it would look like., Did you put the rods in that piece to make it a proper scroll?, Yeah. They’ve all had the rods. Now I’ve started putting slightly more elaborate pieces on them. Adding borders to them. They’re becoming slightly more decorative in places. But keeping with the imagery I’ve developed., What influences your imagery?, Artists I’ve looked at a lot are people like Rubens and Gauguin. I like a lot of Hindu art. Eastern and Western art.,It’s always the figure though. I’m influenced by the figure. I’m trying to dig into myself.,When I began this series I only painted flesh and figure. I began adding elements like fabric and flowers over time. The incorporation process is slow and it lets me pace myself in adding new things. It keeps me interested in the style.,I don’t know what will come next. Maybe dying the fabric eventually. I’m trying to keep myself interested., How long is your attention span?, Pretty long actually. Maybe you can get an idea of how long by looking at the borders. It takes a lot of patience to complete one of those.,When I did the large piece that you were talking about earlier, it might have been the first piece that I added pencil to. Before that I was just applying pen directly to the canvas. I wasn’t drawing anything out before hand. It was an automatic process.,I always knew that I was drawing a figure. So I could always go back to that in my mind. If I felt like I had made a mistake then I could just work it into the figure., How do you deal with mistakes now?, The same way. I use more pencil now to figure out where my lines will go. The pen isn’t directing me so much anymore, I’m using the pencil to direct it.,All of the pieces come from my life. I’m trying to make my own mythology of my life. They’re not really political or social, it’s all just my inner… you know, my shit. I have to keep a steady head and keep doing what I’m doing.,None of these pieces are even for any shows. They’re for imaginary shows that I like to create in my mind. They eventually end up somewhere.,You usually only get a month’s notice before a group show. And a solo show maybe three months. So I have to keep working on the imaginary shows.",Sean Alday is a writer originally from the Florida Keys and now residing in Bushwick.

One of the most distinctive galleries at 56 Bogart and in the neighborhood as well, has released a note addressed to their friends and supporters last night. “,,” writes the gallery director and the curator of the galleries in the building, Peter Hopkins. Peter Hopkins doesn’t explain the details of his abrupt end at 56 Bogart. In order to obtain an explanation, we tried to reach the owners of the building Ted Hovivian and Adrienne Saccone by phone, however we didn’t have any luck.,Peter Hopkins regrets to end the 14 months at The Bogart Salon. However he is promising some exciting news for the future: relocating to another location in Bushwick and an “even bolder and more expansive vision for art and culture.” ,I believe that it is safe to say that The Bogart Salon under the reign of Peter Hopkins was an extraordinary gallery.

Music,"When I moved to Bushwick from Los Angeles, I knew this scene was a force to be reckoned with. I mean, the amount of facial hair alone is pretty intimidating… It has taken me just about a year to navigate this ‘hood true LA Chola style-drunk and disorderly with my music blasting!’ I checked out this show last week at  , in Williamsburg. I have been to this spot over 20 times since moving. I am that girl in the shadows sipping on Vodka head-bopping. I have put in my time, and $1, 000s of bucks at the bar.,The line up for that Tuesday was of a hodgepodge of local bands and visitors. I did a solid walk around the room to throw my vibe out, and hit the bar. Hard. I just didn’t know what to expect, and was by myself. With no band, no friends, I feel like it’s no Dice unless I am sucking down at least 4 Vodka Tonics. Plus a sistah’ is trying to get holler’d at up in the ‘Burg., Wasn’t too sauced to see that a little band called , was up first. Bushwick’s finest. I had seen them six months ago sandwiched between two horrible bands at a festival. So I made my way to the dancefloor to give them a whirl. Then this song, ,happened.,This song filled up the room with this gorgeous sound. Who the hell is Fan-Tan? Where the hell am I? In a movie? Where’s my wallet? All of these questions were answered soon enough. Lead singer Ryan Lee’s vocals are mixed in with these half distorted, plucky riffs. Bassist Sandee K brings in a bassline bed to hold up Mike Sherburn’s banging drums to build up this drama. Drama!! I felt like I was in the movie , So much so I was working a total Molly Ringwald look; biting my lip while looking around for Jake Ryan.,All I could think was, wow these cats are well oiled and rehearsed. , is the second single off  , by Goodnight Records to be released in late January 2013. I want this album! They  also played , which was so unbelievably charged with intensity. The first sound you hear from , is the lead guitar just pounding his strings. This song changed the mood not just in me, but the room. People were paying attention. And really they should; Fan-Tan is not a “Shoe Gaze” band other than the fact they use a lot pedals.,Their set was pretty diverse, danceable, and emotional. I can see this band playing at Hotel Cafe, early slot at Coachella side stage, or on rotation at KCRW or KROQ in LA. The music stalker that I am hassled the bassist Sandee about the songs I didn’t know. She said there was a new song tentatively titled “Crease.” This is what I like about professional bands. Even with an album coming out, they are still creating.  Yeah, this band is definitely part of my life soundtrack.,So here is the setlist: Mimpi, Window, Chapter, 1989, Everything Will Be Fine, Crease, In Waves.,Catch them during CMJ at the Gutter on Thursday and MuchMore’s tonight.,I tried to stick it out for Grandfather and Heliotropes since I am such a chick band lover, but the booze did me in. I am catching them during CMJ. For sure my girls Imma get low at your show! I am saying it now too, these bands are ready for the next level. You might want to get in on them now. I am glad to have seen them in my home away from home Glasslands. I should get my mail delivered here. Definitely putting this place on my Parole Officer’s list of places to find me if I skip bail.

"Featured,People"," That’s a belief that many of us, especially in Bushwick live every day. It is a repetitive pattern: you have a crappy day job in exchange for a paycheck, and work on the things you truly love after hours.  But what if I told you it’s only that belief that is holding you back from doing what you love and receiving abundantly?,Impossible, you say? Maybe , can change your mind. Darcy lives with her husband in Bushwick and makes her living as an ,. It’s a career she’s created for herself in order to fulfill her purpose and follow her deep passion to be of service to people. In addition, she is a reiki master and she teaches reiki at ,. Darcy virtually changes people’s lives through career coaching, energy work and counseling. However, it wasn’t always like that and Darcy herself experienced the same journey to self-discovery as she’s taking her clients on. ,She graduated with a bachelors degree in ecology and biology and was began to teach science and environmental education. Despite doing all the “right” things and having the right relationship, she felt this internal angst and emptiness. “I kept looking for that fulfillment outside of myself.  I just kept feeling like the next thing, the next job or the next place I move to will maybe fill this internal void that I didn’t know how to talk about,” Darcy said. After a couple of years of living everything that , good for her, Darcy found herself constantly doubting her career path. Then even the relationship that meant to her so much ended. “That pain really let me to be open to things that I would never be open to before,” said Darcy about her joining a 3-year long energy medicine school.,Despite being constantly skeptical about the energy medicine school, she kept on taking little steps and completing the program. “It’s called the divine paradox,” Darcy smiled. “The choices that seem the biggest are the smallest and the choices that seem the smallest are in fact the biggest, and the truth and the power is always hiding in the bushes. Gods never show off, they don’t have to. And so the path that I took was the smallest choice next to the smallest choice. Each step seemed in the whole continuum of my life as a random choice but when I look at it now that’s absolutely how our lives unfold just by taking the next small step…”, ,Through reiki and energy medicine work and couching, Darcy discovered that all the answers she was looking for were inside of her. “I found out that I had the ability to know what I wanted and go for it; feel creative, and feel the sense of passion and purpose. I really reconnected, and once I did that I was able to create a career that really matches. Cooper [,] and I got back together and we were able to create a relationship that was real for us instead of all the , and have ,.”, ,So …are you feeling any more compelled to change your life? So how does it exactly work?  We asked Darcy., , ,I call it inner wisdom coaching. It is about helping people to align their heart with the work they want to do in the world, and really bring more of who they are in everything they do., ,I think the biggest point is to transform the idea of ,. A lot of us have this connection that if we do what we want and what is really calling to us, we also need to be poor; we can’t have both – abundance and be fully engaged in our passion. That’s something that I find to be completely untrue. It is actually that belief that stops us; the idea is we have to trade off being creative and making money. We operate from the understanding that we just assume that we are going to be poor. I think it’s absolutely important that we get away from the belief that those two things need to go together; and instead operate from the possibility that when you fully follow your passion, and you are giving yourself in the exact way you’re meant to, you can receive even larger than you’d be able to if you fit yourself into some career box that was tight and didn’t fit for you. We think that we have to be certain way in order to be able to make money but that’s really locking the flow of what’s natural. It’s really natural for us to be connected to our creativity, connected to our inner power. It is also natural to be in a giving and receiving relationship with money, abundance and all those kinds of things. It’s like breathing; we inhale and we exhale. They are even.,Yeah, and it’s controversial. A lot of people have a strong believe that it’s not possible, and that’s ok. It’s ok to just notice what our beliefs are, and what happens when we follow our passion. For myself I know that in the beginning I felt so lucky to be in a path that follows my passion that I expected to be poor, and I expected to not receive from it. That expectation meant that that’s what I got. It wasn’t until I realized that it’s my birthright to be very open about what I give and receive… and when you’re fully pursuing your creativity, you’re in a place where you are fully giving out, which means you can also fully receive back., ,Yes, and the idea that we’re making a trade-off continues: because we’re following our passion, we’re going to be poor, we’re going to get kicked out of the areas as they become nicer…,My husband is a visual artist, and I can see that that world is really challenging, so I know that these things are not simple and that there is no quick fix to shifting the paradigm. It’s really important to be aware and notice this paradigm: that being an artist means being poor., ,I see reiki and energy work as a tool for being able to connect with ourselves. When we’re fully connected with ourselves, we’re confident, we can really feel what our passion is, what our purpose is, and so we’re not as easily sued by rejection. We are not as timid to reach out, to connect with people, to be at the openings we need to be at, to offer our work to places that we think are above us. When we’re connected to why we’re here, we really feel the power and the sense of ourselves, that’s when we’re the most effective and we can connect with the idea that we can be both creative and abundant. When using reiki to help someone to relax we use our hands. We’re not asking for any external relationship to save us or any external power to help us or that call from a gallery owner to save us. We really see that all the power we need is inside of ourselves. So it’s a way to feel stronger.,One way is when we know that we are productive passionate people, but we feel a sense of energy drain throughout the day, we have no motivation for doing things, we know that we should be doing things but we can’t get ourselves to really do it. That sort of general laziness that we feel. Often that is a sign that you’re not connected with yourself. Another way comes out as angst. You’re always so angry internally. You might put a smile on your face and other people will say: “She so great, she’s so sweet.” but inside you constantly want to cry in the bathroom. You feel like inside it’s a totally different environment that what’s on the outside, that face you’re putting out there. That’s a real sign that the inside is not aligned with what is happening on the outside. That’s a real energy drain for you. It takes a lot of energy to put that mask on everyday and so as you continue to do that you just loose motivation and you have a general sense of wanting to give up. Or you’re feeling stuck; feeling trapped like none of your options is a good one. You’re tired of the same pattern, you don’t know what to change or how to change it.,When you reconnect with yourself it allows you to be in touch with all the different possibilities that are there and you see them very differently., ,One of the ways to shift energy is a breathing exercise. Close your eyes, and take a few nice deep breaths, in through your nose and out through your mouth. With the breath you feel yourself releasing all the anger, angst, frustration, whatever you’re feeling. Also bring your attention to your spine, vertebrae after vertebrae and rest on your tailbone. When you bring your attention to your tailbone, it brings you back to your body. As artists and creatives, we spend most of the time up in our heads thinking of new ideas, creating new things - and that’s great in a sense, but we’ve got to stay in our body. Then you just keep taking those breaths and you put your hand on your heart, and just get quiet. It doesn’t take very long. Set your timer for three minutes and this is all it takes to just settle in your body. And then notice as you come back, wiggle your fingers and walk around, notice how your internal environment has changed, there was a shift. If the next email you get is a rejection, it’s not going to be the end of the world., , , ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

Seriously, I only got two letters this week and lucky for you one happens to be from a brilliant comedian who I’m a fan of—alright, truth be told I asked her to submit—I had to! I don’t understand why you aren’t taking advantage of the opportunity to get free advice from a non-licensed therapist with more than ten years of experience. OK, so I don’t have a license for therapy but in exchange, I have a license to tell the truth.,Dear Dr. Lisa-,I am a comedian with a lovely husband and a full-time day job. People tell me I am talented, but it’s a struggle to get my writing and performing out there since I work at my day job—a lot. I have a potential “way out” of the job, but don’t feel right about quitting and spending all my time on comedy without a fully formed plan on how I will approach structuring my time to further my comedy career. Plus, I feel that it’s not right to quit my job to do comedy until I’m earning enough doing it to quit.,
–Emily Epstein White, ,Dear Emily,,Emily, Emily, Emily, this is a cold, cruel world and even crueler for people with strong ethics. Although I admire you for wanting to do things the right way, that’s never going to work in the ruthless world of comedy. Just look at the lives of so many successful comedians/musicians/artists: a lot of them start with sleeping on the floor somewhere when they first arrived in New York. You’ve already proven yourself as stable by holding down a job and a successful marriage. Your idea of making enough money is paying rent. David Cross’s idea of making enough money is to be able to pay for parking so he can sleep in his car. You have way too much talent to not take the risk and get out there. You hinted at a “way out.” Think hard about taking the “way out” with or without a plan. I don’t think you will be able to make a good plan until you see what it really feels like to give yourself the freedom to pursue your comedy career. In other words, you’ve created a conundrum that will keep you stuck. I smell fear—and it’s the fear of success.,-Dr. Lisa,The Connotation Comedy Show is always on the 2nd and 4th Wednesday of every month.

What I’m sensing here is, you are questioning his judgement of how he treats other people; is he a compassionate guy? In my opinion, I’d say yes and no. Yes-if he’s compassionate towards you, he’s certainly capable of being compassionate. And No-in the big picture, if he has disdain for people who have obstacles and need help. Even then— to what degree—does he not think handicapped people should get help, or just slackers who are waiting for their unemployment to run out to start to look for work? I can’t possibly evaluate from your letter, but you can think about his behavior towards other people that you see him come in contact with. If he doesn’t treat YOU with compassion, well that is a deal breaker and you need some therapy.,Part of having a successful relationship with anybody is how you negotiate and this is a great chance to see how you can do this together. It sounds like the politics have gotten personal and is making you a bit critical of each other. Try to gain some awareness together, if you can, of what makes each other angry when you talk about politics.

"Arts and Culture,Featured","On a largely industrial strip of Melrose Street (save the apartments closer to Irving Avenue) a brightly painted rolling door covers a former auto repair shop. Last Saturday afternoon, under a dark cloud cover, groups of people continually walked into the fenced-off yard next door as noisy psychedelica poured out. The scene from the outside-in couldn’t have been more suitable. After all, this was ,’s One Year Anniversary in their Bushwick location.,Different than any other gallery in the neighborhood, Secret Project Robot hosted their anniversary in the afternoon. “We wanted it to be for kids and open to everyone,” said Rachel Nelson (no relation). That became evident during the opening set of psych-prog band Oneida, when one of the member’s toddler sons joined his dad and the rest of the band onstage. The crowd cheered him when he left. ,SPR favorites played both in the backyard and inside all day into the early evening, among them crowd favorites Guardian Alien (ex-Liturgy) and of course the badass K-Holes, whose set was reminiscent of a noisier, more energetic X. The quality of the performances came as no surprise.,“At Secret Project Robot, we usually have really strict criteria for art and music events. Art shows need to be submitted at least six months in advance and musical performances need to be more artistic and special than just a rock show that you can see anywhere else,” said Nelson. “Special and with love are words that are really important to us.”,As a space that grew artistically in their former location at Monster Island in Williamsburg (where they operated for 13 years before the building’s demise,) their relocation to Bushwick has only increased their mission to challenge audiences and artists and be a space for the surrounding community. Since their opening, the various rooms inside have been further decorated, including walls near the bathroom covered in stuffed animals, while the gravel backyard, in addition to housing shipping containers, now contains a stage, bar, tables and large potted plants and flowers. Clearly this is a space run with love and awareness of the surrounding environment’s past, present and future.,For a space that’s already hosted events this year such as the ,, the , and countless noise salons and exhibitions, they’re already looking ahead. Says Nelson, “Bushwick is growing fast. Hopefully all the Spanish families aren’t going anywhere and will continue to have barbecues on the streets and play really loud music at all hours- that is why I moved to New York and I hope Bushwick keeps this.”","Eric Nelson is a fiction writer, freelancer and curator living in Ridgewood Queens.","Bushwig,Rachel Nelson,Secret Project Robot,You Are Here","

"Featured,In the Hood","Try to talk about Bushwick and its future to ten people, and you will get ten different opinions. The funny thing is that these ten different people will likely never talk to each other about it. While Bushwick is a favorite topic among artists who regularly hold , on creating a sustainable future of some sort for Bushwick, some of the important actors on the scene are rarely invited. After I realized that realtors speak a very different language and have different paradigms when it comes to Bushwick, I thought that a trip to midtown would be worthwhile. I talked to Eric Karmitz from Halstead Property, who is the salesperson for the 260 Meserole building that is currently for sale.,…which, by the way, is the building where ,.   ,260 Meserole was built in the 1860s and used to be a brewery. Nowadays, ,, named after the owners Danbro brothers, is a home to a community of musicians, a number of creative professionals (i.e. The Sweatshop, The Bushwick Supply) and, most importantly, to ,. The Wick, which has been not opened to the public yet, promises to be the greatest beer hall in New York. The Well is an enormous concert venue that opened in July and has already brought some incredible names to our beloved neighborhood.,“The building is already making over one million dollars per year and will make for 7-8% return for its future owner,” Eric Karmitz told me. Eric further explained that there is still 20,000 square feet of vacancy space that would be suitable for a hostel or a boutique hotel.,Eric Karmitz can’t hide his excitement about working on a 260 Meserole sale as opposed to his regular Manhattan office buildings. 260 Meserole is the only Bushwick/East Williamsburg building that Halstead Property is working on. “I get to go down there in the middle of the day. It’s great!” Looking for a buyer of “the music warehouse” requires a completely different approach. Eric also came across the issue of how to explain Bushwick to potential buyers. “Hip is a word that our parents are likely to use…” In other words, Halstead is looking for a quirky buyer who gets Bushwick and who really loves music.,“The building will change the area,” Eric said proudly. The conversation got really interesting when Eric pronounced conclusions that the , in September danced around but no one dared to say aloud: “Williamsburg is the new Manhattan, and Bushwick will be the next Williamsburg in five years.” Eric also predicts growth in rent earnings for the property owners and arrival of well-known retail brands to the area.,I asked Eric if they ever thought that the increase in rents in the area might not be good for longtime residents. While it seems that this is not an issue Halstead regularly contemplates, Eric quickly responded that the area around 260 Meserole is not residential anyways. The area is zoned as ,, which means that no residential use of the buildings is permitted. The manufacturing zone is also home to hundreds of artist studios in the area, which are likely to be responsible for making the area so desirable (sociologist , explains why in her book ,). While the NYC Department of City Planning doesn’t seem to be planning to change the zoning to residential for the moment, if this happened it would indeed be a fundamental change to the area. Many of artist studios and other manufacturing spaces would likely be turned into condos, which are far more lucrative for the property owners.,I was interested if the company Eric works for has ever contemplated a financial support to the artists and/or the families in the neighborhood as a way to give back to the community; they would earn a substantial commission from the sale after all. Eric said that he doesn’t know of Halstead planning anything like this; in fact, he hasn’t even thought in these terms. However, Eric agreed that it is a point worthy of discussion for the industry. Although, it should be noted that Eric Karmitz is an employee who cannot guarantee a shift in corporate responsibility of the company he works for.,Whether you are an artist or a longtime resident in the neighborhood, the conclusion we should be making here is that the discussion about the sustainable development of Bushwick will only be productive if it includes all players of the game: brokers, property owners, city planners, urban policy creators, theorists, artists and longterm residents. Without the discussion across the spectrum of players, realtors are unlikely to learn about the needs of the existing community and how to handle its future responsibly.","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

"Featured,People","Hadar Pitchon’s vision of hybrids, emotions, and the future are what makes his ,, as well as his ,, visual Meccas for young, burgeoning male models, equally talented photographers, and top model agencies. What stands out about his work is that he’s extraordinarily self-aware about his environment and about the times he lives in. Hadar doesn’t blindly collect beauty. He puts himself in front of his own camera with equal zeal and vulnerability. With Hadar, it isn’t just about the photography, or executing a simple narcissism project. His process is meta in its approach, timeless in feeling, a performance art on the gritty streets of life. ,I met Hadar over the spring after seeing his , series. And like all life-zeitgeists, it was at the right moment at the right time.  My unhealthy fascination with the , and the , had reached an all too annoying peak. My friends were tired of my late night phone calls on weekly trifecta theories. Hadar and I, along with ,, indulged whatever fit of inspiration I had. He understood what I was projecting, because he does it every day. ,. Hadar is most certainly a triplet of conflict, creation, and re-invention; the exact combination required of any zeitgeist.,“I’m just too much,” said Hadar one Sunday afternoon as we were finishing up blueberry pancakes I made for us. That day I didn’t know how to respond. But 25 days later I can think of certain situations in life that if they hadn’t been “too much” they would have never changed the course of history (,, ,, ,). When Hadar turns the camera on himself, it is strange, unsettling, and at times, yes, too much. But ‘too much’ is a welcome and refreshing change-up to ‘keep-it-cool’ minimalism. I think it’s high time we all stop apologizing for ‘too much’ slather on the purple lipstick, don our intricate headpieces, and go to WORK., ,I photograph because it is my means of self-expression. I also love photography because it allows a sense of escapism. Through the lens I can create my own reality. Give myself or my subjects a freedom that I feel lacks in our everyday lives.,I think Bushwick has definitely inspired me since I moved here. I find it is hard edged, gritty and yet still there are places where art can catch your eye. The best analogy I can think of is that sidewalk where it is all concrete then there is that one little flower growing through the crack.,I think some of the hardest things facing photography is finding your voice. In a world full of social media, blogs, and so many other outlets it’s easy to get lost amongst the masses of images produced day after day. It is why I try to strive for photos that are iconic or timeless. I also think the starving artist element is alive now more than ever. I struggle with making ends meet. Many of us are waiting for our big moments, and we spend endless amounts of time wondering if it will come., ,I do believe we are living in this moment. The struggle is part of the story for most artists. It reminds me of those years where Madonna wandered the east village probably doing every odd job to make ends meet. There is a certain magic to that moment, I think most people do their best work when no one is looking. So it can be some of the best most productive times, the struggle keeps you hungry for more.,I don’t know if I would call it performance art necessarily. I think I try different looks for a combination of reasons. I love to see what a look can communicate to people and what reactions are made. I also think it is another form of escapism, it allows me to change something in this moment and feel some sort of relief. I also think it comes down to the fact I didn’t change my appearance for the first 20 years of my life so perhaps I am making up for lost time.,I think when I first moved to Bushwick it was a shock. I moved from living in a high-rise in midtown with my sister to a basement in a neighborhood I felt was in the middle of nowhere. But as time had gone by and I started to explore, I saw the art scene and met more people and loved the neighborhood. I see it as the new movement, so many amazing people trying to make big things happen!,That is a good question. I think there is always a certain level of attraction that draws me to someone. I look for a dreamlike quality, someone with innocence and yet a stern sense of themselves. I like dreamers and unique beauties. Sometimes it’s there, sometimes it isn’t. I feel there is very much energy with a subject. I find if it ends up to being a good energy the shots come out that much more powerful.,I think the energy from being out here has definitely influenced my work. It has gotten more raw, more gritty. I feel like its stripped down and imperfect, just like the surroundings in Bushwick can be.,Well I have always said vulnerability is the key to my work. I always want to break through that wall and capture something that is so vulnerable and real you can’t look away. I find vulnerability to not only be sexy, but beautiful and what keeps me looking at any image. It is all about developing a relationship with your subject, making sure they feel like they can open up.,I think if I lived anywhere else my work would be different for sure. I find here so many amazing subjects and different types of people! I love that element, and the magic it can hold. I went from creating work in college that had a sense of naivety to moving right to NYC, in doing so I became more attracted to the raw vulnerability the city leaves you with.","Ana Lola Roman is an electronic musician, composer, singer, dancer, choreographer, occasional photographer and wanderlust.

"Arts and Culture,Featured,In the Hood","I’m in the Triangle, the outdoor home to the Bushwick Five Points Festival of Summer 2012. We’re smoking and chatting with the Five Points’ street art patron and curator Joe Ficalora. Joe has been good enough to show me his favorite street art pieces, sprayed expertly on the concrete walls of Joe’s family business. Frank, Joe’s business partner and childhood friend, now passes me a cigarette within the confines of the mysterious Triangle as this native Brooklynite talks about growing up in Bushwick, and bringing art to its streets.,Joe remembers the Bushwick of his childhood. It wasn’t safe enough to play in the streets, a pleasure many suburban children enjoy, and the landscape of the neighborhood was grey and industrial. But Joe also recounts the small community that flourished here, even in those early days. It was the neighborhood butcher who recognized and saved Joe’s grandmother one night. It was Frank’s father Antonino Mattarella who cared for Joe after his own parents were killed in Bushwick. Joe depended on close family friends for support in the community, and still enjoys it today, as he waves to every other person on the street with jovial familiarity.,Even with his close ties to the community, however, the neighborhood “felt like you were in jail.” Before street artists from around the world came to the Five Points, the landscape was a bit bleak indeed. I believe most Bushwickers are familiar with the stretches of industrial decay that give character to our harrowing bike rides home. Unlike today, where street art is abundant enough to off-set the back-drop of the urban, Joe’s horizons were often broken by juvenile graffiti and gang signs.

Sometimes before you can even get to the work, you have to manage some relationships first. Especially if your work involves collaborating.,T.J.,Dear T.J.,
I think it’s likely that you are not defining relationship with your 2 ladies explicitly enough in either direction. Unless there’s something you’re not telling me (really no flirting with this collaborator chick?), you need to take charge and let everyone know where they stand instead of letting them fight it out for themselves. Making art is work, like one of those job things where people pay you for doing something you’re not in the mood to do. Therefore, your collaborator is a colleague. Although making collaborating on art can often be more intimate than working together at “a job”, you have a task that you are both focused on. No matter how personal the work is, try to keep the relationship aspect of your collaboration as professional as possible, particularly when you’re in process; it will be better for the work and everyone else.,Once you feel more in control of your relationship with your collaborator, I think things with your fiance will clear up and you will be more relaxed and productive.

In the equally awesome backyard, I had a chance to speak with a co-organizer Ian Evans who explained this ginger obsession of his and his roommates. “We have been very interested in growing root vegetables in our backyard, and especially ginger.” From ginger growing, there is only a very small step to extracting a tincture of ginger and mixing it with whiskey, naturally.,The Bushwick Ginger Social roof parties started as small gatherings of friends.

"Featured,People","A gigantic snake was wrapping around her, embracing her with its strong limbless body. , responded to her pet snake’s hunger for affection with a motherly tenderness, and to my entertainment with a hint of friendly irritation.  Just as if an old friend of hers wouldn’t shut up about this new guy she met. “Her name is Schoen. It means beautiful in German,” she smiles.,Antoinette invited me to her new place at Bushwick Avenue, to take pictures and to chat about ,.  It was a sunny Sunday morning, but she was ready in her eccentric outfit and distinctive make up. ,At  Le ,, she will be showing her paintings, but calling Antoinette Johnson a painter would hardly do justice to her being. Antoinette is first and foremost a strong individual with a colorful, visually rich soul that begs to be let on the surface. She is living her existence, as she is her art.,Antoinette’s appearance plays an important role in her creative expression, and it’s not easy to put a label on it. Antoinette has always been fascinated with clothes and with fashion running parallel to trends. She uses the term ‘hair sculpture’ to describe the hair she wears and creates for others. Antoinette’s look combines rough and gentle and is full of pop and sub-cultural references. Antoinette herself names cartoon character Elvira as her first and foremost influence, although she adds she’s not trying to copy the look. As she goes on in naming important influences on her, she names a fetish model Kym McLaughlin aka Razor Candi who did her first Mohawk back in the days in Florida. Antoinette recalls that growing up and wanting to express herself in Tampa and Palmetto, which wasn’t always easy. She has met many good people who were important in her life, but still her departure to New York felt like a major liberation.,Shortly after coming to New York, Antoinette landed in Bushwick. She moved in a loft at ,, and opened a big new chapter of her life. “I started to paint again because everybody at 950 Hart was painting all the time, and it was just so inspiring,” she smiles. Very soon the loft was transformed into a gallery that Antoinette co-ran with her roommates, and the course of almost two years brought a ton of new experiences and people into her life. Unfortunately, the history of 950 Hart ended somewhat ,, but ultimately the important stuff remained.,Antoinette’s distinctive style and visual language has soon started to surface in her paintings. She started to paint very flat, with a meticulous attention to detail applying bright neon colors onto the surface. Her art is dominated by a female figure wearing a Mohawk on a neon background. Almost like a mythical reflection of her own self is the female figure in Antoinette’s painting, and then the painting has to serve like a mirror into the ideal colorful world that is much better and much more fun that the real one.,Just like Antoinette herself, her paintings are full of dualities and contradictions. Both Antoinette and the figure in her paintings are rebellious and vulnerable at the same time. Details of their appearance, such as the Mohawk, studs and spikes refer to cyberpunk and fetish. But the feminine side to the artwork and the almost child-like choice of colors and themes are present just as intensely. I believe that her piece ,is a great sample of this omnipresent duality. The female figure is holding her heart that she cut out from her chest. As ugly and rough as the presence of an organ might look in a painting, there is this playful and funny element to it that feels almost as if we were looking at a page of teenage girl’s scrapbook.,I remember Sunday mornings at 950 Hart. In the morning light Antoinette was wearing a cotton shirt and no make up. In the zone, oblivious to her surrounding she would sip on her coffee and paint. She looked so peaceful and intimate. I remember wondering where did the neon-color-Mohawk-wearing cyber girl from last night go? Antoinette smiled softly and I realized that these “contradictions” are in perfect symbiosis and allow for Antoinette’s perfect world to exist, right here on Earth.

One person looked like a pineapple. A person who didn’t look like a pineapple screamed toward the roof of 49 Bogart to “Spread the Jam!” This sent a bunch of hipster extras in a free-for-all running hither and yon, never straying from Bogart Street.,Then, there were some “suits” sitting outside Brooklyn’s Natural at conveniently placed tables and chairs. After start-stop running (which will probably look cool with the HD steady cams that were operating) all the people gathered under an Econoline Minivan with a mountain lion airbrushed on the side.,A young lady was there to preach at the crowd with a megaphone, and here we finally found out what was being sold: “Jam Bluetooth Wireless Speakers comes in six spreadable colors – Spread the Jam!”,Then all the hipsters and suits began dancing in the streets, throwing buckets of corn syrup on one another. Spreading the jam as it were.,Later, they attached a fire hose to the hydrant and began spraying down the street and prop cars. No harm, no foul right? Well, 49 Bogart had a sticky residue on the handrail. Swallow Cafe felt the need to put up a sign that read “Our bathroom is not the Cast and Crew bathroom.” and two of the “hipster” extras blocked the goddamned door to the cafe for two hours.,Part of me wants to say you brought this on yourself Morgantown.

Arts and Culture,"I’ve had the pleasure of , , two of the three art exhibitions I’m about to write about. I’m coming around to the opinion that art should be experienced with a lucid detachment. The kind that comes with waking up next to it as the sun begins to shine in the large loft windows of an old garment factory.,No coffee. No cigarettes. Just a good deal of blinking and possibly a stretch. Things come to you in waves. The realization that a day has begun sinks in and the only consolation is your surroundings.,In ,, the show is ,. Oddly enough, it was the color fields that jumped out first. They sparkled like something you’d expect to find in Studio 54 circa 1979. There were three of them, green, blue and red from the window. The sun hit these first and as it crept in further the netted rocks on the floor began casting shadows.,These rocks, upon first walking into the gallery warranted little more than a glance over, or so I thought. I’d encourage anyone to lay on the floor and face the color fields. It feels like taking a swim off the coast of the British Isles. If anyone looks at you oddly, remember, they’re not seeing the same thing you’re seeing.,Finally, the assembled chair sculptures really set the show off. A figure can be found in one of the sculptures that is easy to overlook upon first wheeling around. Once the sun has made it around to light the entire gallery, look at them from as many angles as possible.,There are many ways to take art in. Much contemporary art requires action on the viewer’s part. No art is created in a vacuum and it never stems from waiting for the paint to dry or the film to develop. With that said, I’d be remiss to not mention the black and white photography that makes up the ‘image’ portion of the show. They flank a paper tapestry that gives off the appearance of being wrinkled. When the windows are open, the tapestry floats with the breeze.,Once you’re ready to move on, it’s recommended that you go to ,. The solo painting exhibition of Sander Cedee: , will challenge everything that I said in the above paragraphs.,The action that is asked of you here is mental. You have to put yourself within the title of the show: Are you inside looking out or are you outside looking in? Where does the distinction even lie?,There are brightly rendered scenes of empty airport lounges. Dark industrial scenes that could very well have been the basement of the building you’re currently in (especially given that it was once home to a huge woodshop).,The thing that got me about this show (and it’s personal which is only fair to share, as I’m asking you to allow yourself the same in this case) was sleeping under the psychiatrist’s office scene. A severe portrait of Freud within the portrait of everything he represents (while we’re on the subject, imagine Freud railing cocaine off of that mirror-like floor), as with every portrait people are nowhere to be found. Except in the case of this one. The ghosts aren’t implied, they’re right there watching over the scene.,In the case of this exhibition: Sleeping here was like having a room with windows to all the other rooms.,The next gallery, ,, is exhibiting , by Colin Keefe. Once again, you have to forget everything I asked you to do before. I viewed this show only as a passerby, let me relate my findings:,This exhibition is a laboratory. Not one that you might find Dexter in, this is more on the level of Captain Nemo’s submarine. Imagine looking out of the portholes and the sea-monkeys (plankton) have actually begun architecturally altering the scene.,They’ve begun building seaports, waterways, causeways. Being eco-conscious they’ve even laid aside many areas for lush algae parks. It’s as though some of the brainier sea-monkeys studied the agricultural history of Papua New Guineans and laid out terraced hillsides to account for the water current’s wilder side. The ancient people of that island nation had to account for tremendous mudslides which could wipe out entire crops.,What the plankton are doing in their imagined cities is hard to know. One thing is certain, some are more aesthetically inclined than others.,It could all be blown away by a blue whale skimming along with his mouth open. Blue whales feed in highly concentrated areas of zooplankton. These entire cityscapes could be blown away by baleen and mouth plates.

"Featured,Food and Drink","When , decided to have a family and headed over to Park Slope there was a sense of emptiness. In its place opened Broomies, which I personally loved for its weekly trivia night. When that closed I lamented loudly over where I would get to play trivia, but after a month of being closed something amazing opened in its place, ,…. (Photography by ,),Three weeks ago, Skytown opened its pretty little doors to the public. Its owners - Jeff Pan, Sabra Saperstein, and Ian Cronin - are all New York City residents who at one point lived in the Bushwick-Bed-Stuy area along Broadway avenue. Ian and Sabra started Skytown by hosting “family dinners” for their friends every Sunday and then migrated to having a booth at the Brooklyn Flea and the Williamsburg Smorgusborg. They met Jeff and began to collaborate on opening a restaurant. Fortunately, six months ago Jeff bought the old Beauty Bar space and opened Broomies. A few months later, with the assistance of friends in the interior design business, they closed what was then Broomies and began building the space for dimes.,The cafe is lined with iron light boxes that remind me of the constellations and the wood accents in the restaurant gives it a warm feeling. The food is fresh. All ingredients are from local farms, and the talented chefs also make the jams and several other ingredients in-house. The sign on the front of the door says “Best Egg Sandwich in Brooklyn” and, boy, was it one of the best egg sandwiches in Brooklyn with arugula, goat cheese, and tomato on a roll. The olive oil granola with yogurt had seasonal fruits, a perfect healthy meal. The Skytown bowl is a medley of grains (in this case rice), the vegetable of the week (green cauliflower), beans, avocado, kale, red cabbage and cheese cooked together. It reminded me a bit of a bibimbap without the egg and the crunchy part.,The cocktails are cheap, only $6 for a Manhattan.  The best cocktail I had was the Hug and a Kiss, made with Blue Moon, pineapple juice, and Aperol. The combination made it taste like orange soda. When I go back to Skytown I will be getting that more often. Unfortunately, the Bloody Mary could have been a bit spicier and/or boozier. I’m a Bloody Mary kind of a gal, sorry Skytown., ",Park Slope transplant living in East Williamsburg,"Beauty Bar,Broomies,drink,food,green,Ian Cronin,Jeff Pan,Sabra Saperstein,Skytown","

The showing was a great warm-up for a Saturday evening- $6 draught, delicous sausages were available at the food truck,  and the beer benches were packed. ,Like many of us who live in Bushwick, I was (and AM!) a huge LCD Soundsystem fan, having seen the band a handful of times in their local NYC before they really hit it big and became a national name, headling festivals and making radio. LCD performs as a collective band, but is fronted by songwriter ,, who first became famous as an ecclectic DJ called Death From Above before beginning LCD Soundsystem in the early 2000s, immediately gaining a cult following for their innovative “disco-punk” genre association. Their three albums, ,, , and , were highly acclaimed, all representing the band’s fresh fold in dance and electronic music- genre bending, startlingly unique, textural, emotionally and lyrically driven- one that has been highly immitated in the years to follow.,So, when James Murphy decided to call it quits in early 2011, fans, self included, erupted in sadness. There was to be ONE “last show ever” April 2nd at Madison Square Garden. Why exactly did he decide to end an extremely successful band in their heyday of success, popularity, and incredible sound-making? , is an elaboration of his decision that it was time to “move on” with his life, having reached the ripe-old age of 40. The “documentary” was clearly an incarnation of Murphy’s own vision (he was one of the producers) of how LCD’s ending would be presented.,The film chronicled the 48 hours surrounding the last show ever. It was a touching, dazzling, chill-inspiring experience for fans of LCD, especially those who had been at one of their last shows ever (me!). Most importantly it was a perspective from where to relate to (instead of hate) James Murphy for ending this superb music machine. Plus, the concert footage itself was spectacular, forcing many of us to get emotional, to get inspired, and even to get up and dance.,Thanks for the free movie, The Well and Rooftop Films!",strict rule breaker. photographer. music obsessee. brooklynite.,"bike-in screening,Bushwick,lcd soundsystem,music,shut up and play the hits,The Well","

Their back garden is quaint with barrel tables scattered amongst regular tables. The ivy-laden walls strung with Christmas lights gives it a DIY Bushwick aesthetic. People sat around smoking their fags and sipping on house cocktails, wine or ales. ,Inside the dim-lit restaurant Victorian paintings hung on the walls, ceiling fans blew, and the tin ceiling added an old world flare.

My name is spelled phonetically.”,He was right. It was hard to find him there.,However, the three dimensional aspect of our meeting allowed us to reconnect in , almost a week later.

The show is called , and it is a well-curated, long-gestated, international-and-local-artist-featuring group exhibition without a theme.,It is also one of those excellent shows that sneaks up on you. Something that won’t be done justice with a press release or hype or any of that other bullshit that I sometimes have to wade through in the search for something transcendent.,I use the word “bullshit” lovingly.,I asked Steve about his curating method for the show, “It was about finding a piece that the artist was comfortable showing. It was really fortunate that we got such good work.”,Yeah, I hear you but what did that method produce? What’s being shown?,As soon as you walk in, there’s an idyllic painting by Erika Langstroth of centaurs, green color fields, and what looks like a tornado coming. Centaurs aren’t exactly idyllic creatures so there is a subtext (which I want to tie to North Brooklyn but won’t here) (and there’s that tornado, which are making a come back). Immediately to the right of the opener is a large painting of two female wrestlers engaged in a hold that looks painful or passionate. The thing about it though, is that , painted them so subtly that they look like they’re in a free fall, plummeting to somewhere but unwilling to give up the fight.,The other pieces that really fill out first floor room (though there are many) include one by ,, a classical nude on a bicycle covered in clematis vines, be-smirked or vandalized with a wide clowning smile. Another is a painting by ,, a Picasso-like nude-self-portrait with breasts. Mr. Waters was one of the first artists to be invited into the show.,On another note, I had breakfast with Steve under that painting. It holds up to cowboy coffee and kale mornings. I can’t wait to revisit it in the evening.,“So that was the first floor,” Steve Mykietyn said to me while I pointed a camera at him in his garden, “I didn’t necessarily care for figurative work. But it’s important. It reminds us of what makes humans human. Conceptual work is an idea stripped down which can be beautiful, but it doesn’t give full voice to the complexities of being human.”,Downstairs, to the proper gallery space, I saw two pieces similar in idea and execution coming from two artists across the pond from one another. , and , have horror affiliated creations playing with (supposed) innocence. Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein see-saws with a little girl in Martin’s piece, Freddy Krueger and Ronald McDonald wrestle in the nude, smiling.,A strange idea sparked in my head, Ronald McDonald and McDonald’s food is an abomination stitched together from death and obsession much like Frankenstein’s monster. A truer picture of American horror than Freddy Krueger. The way Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein is a disturbed Prometheus bringing fire to people, was it worth it to give the people what they wanted before they knew that they desired it?,Are fast food and fire and Greek myths and American myths really drawn from this? I’m curious as to whether or not you see simple pop art, or if their proximity and suggestions add to something larger? It may be a reach, but it’s been turning over in my head since I walked down the steps.,I do know that Freddy Krueger is as much of an imagination creation as an innocent child. Remember Freddy Krueger started off in a nursery rhyme. A sing song voice coming from the top of the see-saw maybe? I didn’t asked the curator because we moved on to an amazing collage by ROBY One.,A small sculpture by Ben Godward featuring lava slides of eye candy, a large bucket and children’s toys for sandcastles.

Need a cure for that frayed party soul of yours?  Check out the art that was going up on Bogart between Meadows and Stagg.  Owns, an established neighborhood artists you may recognize, commented that the work was going on all day, and some LA artists were showing up periodically to contribute.  Here are some images of the two gentlemen hard at work.,

Food and Drink,"Brooklyn is right to be proud about its diverse food scene, but it’s no secret that Queens also has a lot to offer when it comes to food, too. The borough is known especially for its authentic immigrant food – Greek, Mexican, Colombian, Uzbeki – but Long Island City in particular has become a home to European-influenced and New American dishes, as well as myriad artisanal foods. LIC continues to gain a reputation for excellent eats.,We love you, Brooklyn – hey, you’re just over the bridge from LIC. So come visit – bike (the Pulaski has a safe bike lane), walk (it’s a short walk, we promise), drive (we have parking), take the ferry (from DUMBO or Williamsburg), or take the subway (7/E/F/M/N/Q/R, and the G). We’ll feed you well.,Here are some places we think you’d like to check out when you’re hungry. We’ve grouped them by street, and most are accessible by subway, at the least.,If tasty pub grub and an seemingly endless beer list appeal to you, Alewife has your number. It’s only a couple of blocks from the Vernon-Jackson 7 stop, and shows off with a beautiful, warm dining room and terrific group of bartenders and servers to help you out. We’re partial to their fries, which come with parmesan and truffle oil. The burger is also terrific., (,),This is one of the new kids on the block and is a restaurant that should not be missed. Chef Ian Kapitan brings all sorts of interesting dishes to the menu with the imprint of New American style throughout. The menu also changes with the seasons. Anything having to do with pork is a winner, like the Berkshire pork loin (BTW, occasionally they’ll hold pig butchering classes at the restaurant); the pickles are delicious and are made locally (the carrot and sweet tarragon is especially good); the Long Island Duck is also amazing. Cocktails also change with the seasons – give their gin-based Quince Cooler a try if you find it on the menu. Brunch is also served on the weekend, where you’ll find croissant french toast, a stellar BLT, and their popular wild mushroom toast.,¬†(,),This cool, sophisticated, yet unpretentious wine bar is owned by Tournesol proprietor Pascal Ecriout, and is¬†located just next door to the restaurant. Stop in here for a glass of wine, cheeses from Artisanal, and local oysters and charcuterie. Late nights there’s often jazz. This is a real refuge from the hustle and bustle of the city, a great place to relax with a glass of vino and your loved one(s).,(,),This new Vietnamese spot is serving classics like pho, clay pot dishes, spring rolls, and banh mi sandwiches. Particularly good is the ginger clay pot chicken – the dark meat chicken is moist and the rice below soaks up the sauce. Give the homemade pickled plum soda a try for something a little different, or the ginger lemon soda, recommended by the staff.,¬†(,),Welcome to the home of great and varied comfort food – consider a half pound burger that comes with sweet potato fries, pulled pork tacos al pastor, disco tots, and chicken fried chicken. The cocktails are also delicious, including the Jim Jam that comes with muddled blackberry and orange with a bourbon base; the pisco sour is also fab.

"Featured,People"," Tell me about 2012., This year I’ve concentrated especially on my street. Getting familiar with all the Hispanic families and people who’ve been here for thirty years. One guy’s been here for 55 years. It’s been eye opening, in a way.,I enjoy it. I look at other areas that have been quote-unquote gentrified. And I’m really happy that this little neighborhood the correct Spanish word for it is , has survived like it has. My block is like a village, like a , in that it’s really concentrated.,There’s so much Spanish culture here and I find that a lot of people outside of that don’t really interact with the people or the food. I mean if people think that going to the , that Anthony Bourdain did a review on – if you think that’s coming into the neighborhood and being a part of the neighborhood then you’re very much mistaken.,Although I wouldn’t discount that place. The history behind it and the tortillas they make that pretty much supply Brooklyn. It’s only scratching the surface.,There’s so much culture here. Though it’s been diluted a lot; even by the Hispanic people themselves., What’s the most remarkable thing that you’ve learned since you started focusing on your neighborhood and your block?, Well, keep in mind when I say that, that when I left South Florida I lived in a predominantly African American neighborhood, but I was always surrounded by Hispanics, Haitians, Jamaicans. I mean the Haitians used to call me , which essentially meant white boy.,I was always mixing it up. I’m not saying that I didn’t hang out with white people. That would be some form of self hating. I was searching for something other than the surface and something more than who I am.,I think that growing up in an Italian-American home, and we were more American than Italian for sure, but life was about Sundays being dinner days. My mother was adamant about that and she’d make , from scratch. Even though I’d consider myself a typical white person, I do fight it a little bit, and it comes from the roots of something bigger.,Going back to your question, it’s the community! And I knew that it existed, growing up in South Florida I saw it all the time! You know that, you’re from there. Even just tonight hanging out on the stoop, you see the kids running around, and you hear people say “Go get some ice cream at the bodega.” Every day is a block party but no one labels it that. There’s no proclamation. It’s more “this is who we are” rather than “this is what we do.”,For instance, I was talking to this one guy who now lives in the Bronx and he’s been there for six years. He grew up on this block and he comes back once or twice I month. I see him that often.,And we were just talking and he’s like, “I got to come back to my people. I got to come back to my block.”,I asked him how long he has to travel and he answers “An hour and a half one way on the train.”,Like I said, he’ll come back at a bare minimum once a month just to see the people he grew up with. That’s how close the community is.,I was talking to one of the guys on the street, and I can’t call them these guys. They’ve become my neighborhood family. They’ve become a piece of me. I can’t walk down the street without seeing one of my family members and sometimes you go “Hey, I’m busy what’s up? What’s going on?” and sometimes you stop and talk for five minutes, sometimes you stop and talk for two hours. Sometimes I’m sitting inside and I just have to go outside and talk to my family. Sometimes I’ve spent all day with my family., ,It’s not like I tried to do that. But in the back my mind I felt like that’s what old New York was like. I can’t really say the late seventies to the eighties because there were some bad times. But maybe during the sixties.,Ultimately where are people really hanging out? They’re outside barbequing in their gated area. Or they’re inside spending time with their family.,Some of my family members are single with no kids, some are single mothers, some have wives and kids, some are older and divorced. It’s all across the board. But there’s a consistent community. Everyone watches out for each other. Cook together, drink together, some people smoke this or that. This is where they live.,I think that mentality comes from when they grew up. Back then you didn’t want to leave your street. You didn’t step on someone else’s street because they ran that street. That mentality is still there. Now it’s not like that, but back then you didn’t go on someone else’s block. And you didn’t come on this block if you didn’t know anybody. It’s the New York City mentality where everything is confined. It’s claustrophobic. So when you have a space, that’s yours, I own this space. And it’s a big space, it’s a block., What was the moment in which you broke through whatever was there and met your future family?, Well there wasn’t really a moment. I didn’t really do this on purpose it just happened.,Actually, I can tell you this. One night I was coming home, it was late and I needed a lighter for some reason. So I asked one of the guys, you know, “Can I borrow a light?” I lit my smoke and hung out for a few minutes and talked with them.,It was just showing respect. I needed something, you had it and let me borrow it. Let me return the favor by hanging out for minute. Just showing respect.,You have to give respect to get any. I think that’s it.",Sean Alday is a writer originally from the Florida Keys and now residing in Bushwick.

Arts and Culture,"Your meteo-sensitivity will be on alert when you come to , this weekend.  Deborah Brown, curator and the owner of the gallery chose an interesting duo of classically trained painters: , (in the main space) and , (in the project room). Common to the work of both artists is the dense atmosphere created by the weather, whether it’s an apocalyptic gloominess of Karen’s tornados or foggy peacefulness of Kerry’s Empire State Building. ,At Storefront you can see natural disasters and peaceful landscapes painted by Karen Marston, shown side by side. The striking moment provided by these diametrically different kinds of subject matter comes when you realize that they are actually not so different… Maybe antipoles of one. Karen’s work can lead to almost meditative realization that whether it’s a beautiful sunny day in a countryside or a destructive tornado, they are just two modes of one great nature, the all-creating force. In her paintings, Karen doesn’t evaluate; she won’t have you scared or pleased. Karen simply states: “There is a fire in the forest;” her statement is vivid but it lacks any assessing connotation.,To paint the natural disasters, Karen used photographs collected from newspapers and news feed.  ”I simply like how the tornados visually look.” Karen’s paintings don’t have narrative or documentary function. They are an homage to the beauty of nature in its purest form.,The project room has rarely felt more like a giant window to a quiet cold night than this month. The walls are filled with paintings of one object painted from the same angle over and over again. The Empire State Building on a black night background is what Kerry Law sees every night from his Ridgewood apartment. Kerry in fact makes a painting of his view almost every night. Depending on the weather and the illumination, the painting slightly differs every night. Sometimes it’s sharp with every detail visible, sometimes the structure is hidden under a thick layer of fog and you can see only a silent winking light from at the top. Kerry Law’s repetitive work is quiet but insistent. Just life itself. As Kerry finishes his painting and goes to sleep, another night flows by followed by another night. But two nights will never be the same, just like Kerry Law’s painting quietly reminds us…","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

"Featured,People"," I want to hear about how you came to Bushwick., I moved here in 2008… I didn’t realize that I was going to end up in Bushwick. I planned to move into Manhattan but that place fell through. I was feeling pretty anxious because I was moving in four weeks., Luckily things came together though my sister’s friend. It was quite different than what I’d planned.,I remember getting off at the Morgan stop… It was actually New Year’s Eve going into 2009. This girl I was shooting, her sister lived in Bushwick.,She told me “Meet me” at this address, I don’t think she even said the name of the place. I didn’t realize then, but it was the Wreck Room where I was meeting her. I don’t think it could have been more perfect because I find that to be the most legitimate bar in the area that reflects late 70’s, early 80’s New York. The only one in the area that holds true to that time period.,When I got of the subway, and keep in mind that this was New Year’s Eve, there was one person on the street other than me. I remember feeling a little uneasy. Maybe people feel that way now, I don’t know. The only thing there at the time was Roberta’s which may have been closed. I think King’s County may have been open, but I didn’t know that those places were even there. That was it. There wasn’t even Eastern District, which is gone now.,Let’s make a long story short here: At Wreck Room, at the bar, one of the girls said “Can I touch your dick?” And this whole night was a total New York moment that you think is what’s going to happen to you once you get here. It was the epitome, in my mind, of what New York represented. And I’m not saying here, now, that Wreck Room represents that.,Imagine a first timer getting off at a completely desolate subway stop, going to a bar that was spray painted and stickered, and a girl at the bar asking to touch your dick. Then after all of that, I go back to the subway and there’s this guy acting totally crazy, acting kooky. I mean absolutely absurd. We start talking about , the Marin Scorsese movie which took place in SoHo in ‘85 I think. You couldn’t pick a better movie to talk to me about.,And that’s totally died for me. I don’t run into people that talk about , or act as kooky as this guy. But we became acquaintances and I ended up going to the Brooklyn Museum with him and his girlfriend. Afterward he says, “Oh let’s go to this loft party.” Well, I didn’t know it then but it turns out to be the McKibben Lofts and AKA Potion was the café there then. It was awesome. I remember we tried to go to the loft party and we couldn’t find it, so we go to the other building across the street from there and we’re just walking around. We saw these blue lights on, it turns out to be AKA Potion which later ended up opening some doors, and the Potion Collective started later on, a few other things that I’d rather not go into…,But it was very cool there was someone painting in there, someone was playing piano, there was a group shooting a video that I ended up being in., Can you find that film anywhere?, I really have no idea about what happened to that.,But we walk in and we ask “Is this closed?”,They go, “Uh, kinda.”,Which is such a New York moment! When was the last time you go to a business and they’re like well we’re kinda closed? It reminds me of , in that respect where he walks in the diner and asks if they’re closed and he answers, “Well it’s kinda after hours.”,Anyway. That was my first experience with Bushwick. Which was just two days into New York for me., Where were you living?, I was temporarily staying in Greenpoint. But I kept coming back, even though I didn’t live here, it was my first experience of Brooklyn other than where I lived. I didn’t have as much work then so I was coming back at least four or five times a week.,My permanent residency here began three years ago. It wasn’t that I just made friends here, I had friends already living here. Plus, you know, I was coming back almost daily. What was the point of taking the G to the fucking L?, , Then the first artists you met were the future Potion Collective?, No, I was brought in later by a guy by the name of Bill Bartholomew and he was running a venue called Bushwick Studios next to the Anchored Inn I believe it’s called…,After they closed up shop he calls me up and says that he wants to start a collective. Basically bring Potion back. He and I had a meeting, he said that there was an “unofficial” collective at the time, once he brought me in we became official with a logo and all these other things., ,So we put on one of the more successful shows of Bushwick Open Studios 2010 at the Loom. Now everyone shows there, but then they only had one art thing going on. Now it’s this permanent collection of shops…,I don’t know, I went there recently and there was this weird candy shop or dessert store… But Dan Victor, who is an awesome musician, he introduces me to Tobias Stretch – who’s done videos for Radiohead, Crystal Fighters… – anyway, he was showing work during Bushwick Open Studios with us and at the time he was a Philadelphia artist. He was showing against that wall where that shop is now!,And it’s kind of, you know, boo hoo, but a lot has changed. A lot has changed…, , What was the next phase after that for you?, After that… I guess in a way it was you guys at 950 Hart and staying in my neighborhood. I think that while I was in Potion I began realizing that the Morgan Stop was really changing from something that I wasn’t interested in anymore. So I decided to stay in my neighborhood, and I won’t say the street, but somewhere around Hart [laughs] and , on Knickerbocker, the infamous Tony’s.,I want to give a shout out to Lorenza and her family who’s owned that place for 40 years. They grew up on Hart interestingly enough. She grew up on Hart. Her dad has owned that pizza joint since… the late 60’s I want to say. That’s a legit spot. He actually owned the original Tony’s and sold that. But I don’t want to go into that., , The birthday show in October [2010]?, Yes! I was hanging out at that show in October and the next big thing for me was , at ,., Yeah! The Trailer Park Crew., Right! So after that I came to the group show at your place in December. Then we hooked up for the group show in February. Then I showed again with you in June for Bushwick Open Studios. Then we had , in September., ,I guess in between that I was doing a lot of stuff in Manhattan. Yeah, it was 2011. I was doing a lot of club stuff, showing videos.,We kind of fast-forwarded a lot, but that’s a general timeline. It’s weird, I don’t think that there’s been a foggier time in my life living in New York.

You have a chance to find out at , art show ,, which opens ,. ,Alan and Michael Fleming are twins who have never been separated. That is until 2010-2011 when one of them lived in New York and the other one in Chicago. They missed their joint studio practice and each other’s company, and thus the twins began a true long distance twin brother relationship using post cards, “psychic” games, Polaroids, calendars, and other ephemera. The twins have been playing “rock, paper, scissors” over the phone for months not knowing who won; they have been thinking of the same color, and investigated the alleged psychic connection between twins.

Hiding it’s coolness from Brooklyn under a Queens ZIP, it shows its loving face only to folks open to adventures outside of their favorite borough and simply open to finding that mythical ,. ,Several galleries and artists of the Williamsburg and Bushwick legacy have moved their artful existence to over the border to Ridgewood.

No doubt that these excellent female painters will provide for some Friday night artful enlightment in Queens. Of the strong foursome, I would like to point out Israeli painter Gili Levy. Gili has been proving on a number of occasions that she owns Bushwick’s , heart, and rightfully so. Let’s recall her excellent shows at Centotto, Ethan Petit Contemporary or Brooklyn Fire Proof.,The next stop on a Friday night stroll through Ridgewood is Palmetto St. Look for a small black door because it leads to consistently beautifully curated art space lead by artists Matthew Mahler and Jonathan Terranova.  Gallery space , has been taken over by the pure life force energy – artist Julie Torres.

For example, a Jenny Holzer flyer from the ’70s, similar in spirit to what you might receive from an occupy rally today, is encased now in glass. On the opposing side, a fingerprinted reproduction of The Diggers 1960′s piece , was available for the taking.,In addition to , the gallery ran a classroom series called , in various locations from July 5th – August 30th culminating at Tompkins Square Park.,The second gallery I’m calling best of the summer is ,. This may seem odd, since they missed Bushwick Open Studios and were able to host only one show over the summer. But it was another show that encouraged accessibility and openness to art.,Small Black Door held a show in July entitled , in which they asked participants to bring a piece of art – a piece of themselves – and they would receive a raffle ticket. Between the hours of 5-9pm the walls filled with 62 works and Polaroids of those who brought themselves hung on the opposite side. A potluck and music sets by jojoSoul filled those four hours until at 9pm. The work was raffled off and everyone who contributed went home with something.,Finally we come to the studio/gallery space run by our own Jen Hitchens: ,.,The inaugural show ,featured works by friends. Of friends. It included pieces by Nick Greenwald, Theresa Daddezio, and Julian Lorber along with 19 others. The prices ranged from $1.75 – $875. While the general run of this exhibition can’t be honestly cast among the mould breaking kind chosen above, this article is about the galleries behind them.,Following the exhibition’s closing party, a post was made in the Facebook event page telling those who “attended” that they could enter a raffle to win one of the pieces in the show, a geometric piece by Ricardo Paniagua. To enter the raffle, one simply messaged Weeknights with a number between one and one hundred and the piece would be shipped to the winner.,I talked to Jen about this raffle, stating that I entered with the number 42. She said the raffle was something she wanted to continue doing following Weeknight’s shows. A personal connection between the gallery, the artists, and the new owner of a piece could be made with this little bout of fun. It doesn’t hurt that Jen is a good curator.,Thanks to the galleries for changing the game this summer.",Sean Alday is a writer originally from the Florida Keys and now residing in Bushwick.

The band, who dashed around the BK music scene with brass, punk-garage tunes, first made a name for themselves in 2010 and played as recently as last month. The band is known for their widespread appeal (they have fans in Europe!) and unique sound- difficult to label, it falls somewhere between rock and operatic punk. And it’s very Brooklyn. There’s beauty trapped in the webs of their haunting lo-fi sound, bursting vibrato guitar and static drums falling in tune to lead singer Caitlin’s soaring, classically-trained vocals that produce spooky harmonies.,Since then, the band released 3 EPS and 2 singles on ,, all to high esteem.

"Arts and Culture,Featured,Opinion","Two ideas were organically integrated into nearly every discussion during the citydrift panel discussions over the weekend.,1. Art galleries in this neighborhood are artist enablers.,2. People involved in this scene, veterans of older ones, and even casual observers are keenly aware of the assumed narrative of what happens as artists move into neighborhoods.,To the first point, there were over three hours of artist panels on Saturday to kick it off. Artists who participated in , each gave presentations in ,.,The poets who hashtagged their tweets , spoke about the oddity of gaining followers as the night progressed, hashtags themselves, and about Tweeting to someone who was within reach of you. There seemed to be a self-consciousness that first enveloped and then dissipated as the night wore on.,It was an interesting discussion that also touched on gender, as at least one poet created a fake twitter account for a different gendered person and ended the night with more followers on that account than her “real” account. This may have been one of the more meta-drifts of the meta-event that was citydrift.,Michael Kronenberg and I sat on our yoga mats and discussed the ,. A year-plus long project in which he and I will stay in a different artist’s studio/home or an art gallery every night for a year. We began our project during citydrift in Momenta Art.,Essentially he talked about embracing one of the greatest fears an individual can have. The one we’ve identified as being most poignant is losing your home. For the project we are depending on the kindness of strangers to provide shelter in an energetic exchange that requires blurring our comfort zones to the point of nonexistence.,Mike spoke at length about how we had created a little box in our art gallery and we grew so comfortable that we missed many of the amazing things happening around us. He surmised by explaining that we are taking our yoga mats to everyone else’s little boxes and reporting on what’s happening there.,For her drift, performance artist , dressed as a chicken and gave out eggs and chicken on skewers. She was followed by two other costumed performers who pushed people into taking the egg and taking care of it. This was a fun drift to run into. The posse corralled me right outside the 56 Bogart building, we discussed a great many things including the plight of artists and picking up every penny you find on the sidewalk.,She discussed how people reacted to the offer of an egg and food. Upon taking the egg you then “owed her.” The debt could be paid with money or with your body. Many people attempted to give the egg back after being told they were in her debt. It seems that the option of paying with your body was either a red herring or not taken seriously.,I gave 26 cents in the form of a quarter and a penny from the sidewalk.,These panels ended up being an eclectic navel gazing festival. Peter Hopkins was one of the panelists who kept them interesting. A man on the curators’ and gallerists’ panels sighed audibly and bantered, verging on insulting, fellow panelists. It was reminiscent of Jack Kerouac on William F. Buckley’s show in 1968 (,).,There were a lot of repetitious questions that went something like, “Yeah, but what are you doing for the community?”,As someone remarked, art people go to art galleries.,I’m going to ask this question: Short of grabbing people by the arm and forcing them to look at art that they may or may not want to see, what can you really do for your community?,By asking that, I open the can of worms on display during these discussions. Which was a very defensive posturing that provided the opportunity to tell people what you did personally to engage “the community.” Definitions of “the community” are slippery and no one can give a concise answer.,I have a cognitive dissonance regarding this phenomenon. Which is “Good for you. Really. I don’t care.”,Don’t tell me what you did. Do it and let your actions speak for themselves. If you do the right thing, then it will be known by consistency only.,I think that citydrift was the perfect idea. A decentralized “letting go” of ego, prejudice, preconception, fear, and pretension. I only wish that the community will do so with full confidence in themselves going forward.

This mid-career artist experienced both highs and lows but it seems that no matter what, Fuchs is always able to stand up, dust off his shirt and put on a big smile.,Fuchs, proud resident of Bushwick since 2005, nearly lost his studio on Bogart Street earlier this year.

The work exhibited in the first room displays nude women, mostly captured asleep or in intimate moments such as in the shower or in a drug high. The work in the other room relates to the 9/11 tragedy. Fuchs was attending a roof gathering on Bleecker Street that day, and captured the first reactions of his companions to the event. People in the photographs could hardly comprehend the impact of the tragedy in that moment, and many of the images resemble vacation photos (“Oh, look that’s me doing a V sign while the Twin Towers are burning”). The images are shocking and offensive to many, but expressions of art to others.,The nudes in the other room are only seemingly unrelated. Just as Fuchs’ 9/11 series, the nude photographs pose the question of when it is acceptable to take photos. Who decides that and where exactly is that borderline? Rafael Fuchs said that he has model releases from all of the models so the posed question isn’t legal, it’s strictly ethical. The portrayed women vary from professional nude models to random acquaintances from Bogart Street. One of the sleeping women later died of a drug over-dose. Another photographed woman spent the night at Fuchs’ studio after she met the photographer while singing in the street. Fuchs says that she went to organize her purse, and was found later on “passed out” on drugs next to a huge mess., , ,So can you take a picture in a moment like that? If the answer is no, then does the fact that you are artistically compelled give you an exception? If the answer is yes, then what if the photograph doesn’t meet aesthetic standards? What if you took it with a camera phone instead of an expensive DSLR? Would it still be ok?

Arts and Culture," ,Combining crowdsourcing with the perennial trend of participatory art, ,, which will debut this weekend in New York’s most populous borough, is an attempt to produce a “community curated open studio project.” The pilot program is an experimental exhibition organized by The Brooklyn Museum, made capable through collaboration with a host of volunteer delegates coordinating the composite neighborhoods. In order to participate, you must be an artist with a registered studio or a registered voter who can “check-in” at any given location via an Internet application. Participants can nominate up to three of their favorite artists, but only after checking in at a minimum of five studios. Nominations will be tallied from the GO Brooklyn I-phone app, text messages, or numeric codes assigned to each studio on the mobile website. Ten artists with the highest number of votes will be awarded a studio visit from a Brooklyn Museum curator to select work for an exhibition opening at the museum on December 1, 2012.,Despite the numerous (and somewhat exclusionary) parameters of the project, the website is surprisingly clean and well designed. Under the “explore” tab, 12 artists are featured from a selection of randomly chosen studios (out of hundreds of registered locations) and users can also search with a keyword or name. Results are filterable by location, accessibility, and/or medium. The best feature? Registrants can save noteworthy entries to a sharable itinerary list to help organize (and remember) their path.,Over 1750 studios are signed up for GO Brooklyn, making it nearly impossible for visitors to hit every one in the two-day span. To help intimidated art-seekers get started, , to my own , itinerary (subject to change based on ambition level and reliability of public transportation in Brooklyn, which, on any given weekend, is spotty at best.),I am curious to explore studios in the Navy Yard, one of the more historic artist enclaves in Brooklyn.

Arts and Culture," , ,The Brooklyn Music Society’s , opens its third day of music to a crowd that basks appreciatively in this suburbia-esque setting, in these last days of summer. The Historic , sets a tone of green, cropped grasses, white picket fences, and drooping hydrangeas, specimens that could have recently enjoyed a grooming by one of the neighborhood soccer moms. We can end our comparison to the American ‘burb here, however, as artsy hippies, bedecked in fairy wings and draped silks swoop and pose around the hydrangeas. A belly dancer, whose attire chimes with every nubile step, entertains the locals in their lawn chairs, while stage hands scuttle over the main stage in preparation for Los Mas Valientes.,There are burgers and beer, blow-up kiddie pools and face-painted children, but Fall is in the air. The sun is decidedly gone by half-past seven and I’m finally not sweating my tits off in a summer swelter. As Brooklyn-native lead singer Jessica Valiente mounts the stage, I sway to her Latin gypsy flavor and reminisce. What were the highlights of my summer?,Niko and Olivia, true American gypsies, man the only vendor’s table at the fest. They have spent the summer in and around Brooklyn, selling their wares (osseous hand-made jewelry and chai lattes) at events around the neighborhood. I ask them what their favorite shows of the summer were.,“Oh, the Gowanus Ballroom.”  Olivia names her favorite music venue of the summer. She also mentions the Acheron on Waterbury Street.,Niko speaks up from under her black blanket (also a harbinger of Autumn), mentioning that she liked a show at the Vice Gallery in Williamsburg. But her highlight of the summer was the Bushwick Block party.,Los Mas Valientes have switched out to welcome The Grand Masters of Gypsy, house band of the cosponsor of the event, the Mehanata, a nearby Bulgarian Bar. I’m captivated by Yuri Yunakov on the Alto Saxophone, my own weapon of choice when the mood strikes.,Raffael, a DJ at the Mehanata, smiles knowingly at my expression, “Yuri is a living legend in his own country.” He scrawls in my notebook. Raffael’s friend Lucho agrees. Lucho says his favorite show of the summer was the Gypsy Tabor Fest at the Mehanata. The two gypsies point me in the direction of their manager, who says fairly, “I’m drinking,” when I inquire about asking the living legend a few questions.,Instead, I’m happy to run into the beautiful, the exotic, Gamze Ordulu, lead singer of The Grand Masters of Gypsy. The student laughs when I tell her I didn’t understand anything she said on stage, but understood completely. Her first name means “dimple,” and I’m intrigued by her taste in music. Gamze’s favorite show of the summer was at the Millenium Theatre in May (Okay, so technically it’s not summer, but I was definitely sweating in May), where she saw Israeli vocalist Sarit Hadad.,The crowd is warm and smiling after the Grand Masters of Gypsy leave the stage, and the gypsies of the Mehanata have by now convinced me to take another shot of tequila.

Opinion," ,Summer doesn’t end just because the calendar says it’s Labor Day on Monday. But one has to admit that it certainly feels a little different. Whether you like it or not it’s time to wake up from the summer romantic dreaming and GO! …or drift…,While the past weeks floated by sweetly in the form of watermelons and on tops of the roof, the upcoming week is filling me with great expectations and just a (lil), pointy anxiety as is always the case when the number of art openings in the hood exceeds 10. Not only is virtually every gallery in Bushwick having an opening, it’s also a time for two bigger events to happen. , and , will both happen next weekend.,Go! Brooklyn is an all Brooklyn open studio event organized by Brooklyn Museum. “Open your studio and wait for the votes from your visitors,” says Brooklyn Museum. “If enough votes are casted, and if you’re lucky, you might get a show at Brooklyn Museum.” In other words, Brooklyn Museum says that you better send out at least 5 emails to your contact list; create that Facebook event and buy 6 bottles of Trader Joe’s wine, to ensure that people come and vote, because a lot is at stake. I have to appreciate the lesson in self-promotion Brooklyn Museum is trying to teach us here. Yes, it is important to let people know you exist because if they don’t know you exist, does it even matter that you create? Interesting c, had this week Jen Hitchings with a married artist couple Jane Fine and James Esber, who have been collaborating for years and even share a studio, yet Jane decided to Go! and James decided not to Go!,On Monday, , from , and the brain behind another big event next week, , write about the concept and his inspiration. In his essay he pronounced a couple of amazing quotes on creativity and innovation that I wish we all pondered a little longer than usual.,I consider myself a Buddhist, and I like citydrift better. Much smaller budget, much smaller PR, much more concept to it. citydrift invites us to come to one of the participating galleries and join one of the drifts that will go on a walk around Bushwick. Each drift will consist of a small group of people, like 7 or 10, and will have more or less concept to it. What all the drifts will have in common is that you will be encouraged to experience, to perceive, to see, to feel, to drift… Whether it’s an intentionally placed art installation or an accidentally discovered beauty, citydrift is essentially a trip back to the beginning where we ask: Why art? Why feel? And most importantly, it places the emphasis on the experience of art that should bring joy, pleasure and happiness.  Because no matter what they tell you, a show at Brooklyn Museum will not bring you happiness. It will bring you societal recognition, but not happiness. Because happiness is your state of mind when you feel and create out of the pure desire of heart and the only approval that matters is your own., ,Anyway, I wish you an amazing “last” summer weekend. Enjoy and next week, back to work!, ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily. She can easily be moved by reflection of the sky in a puddle.

Arts and Culture," is a sometimes-bearded, ubiquitous face of the Bushwick art scene. But Alexander Duke is also a super friendly artist who has probably seen more artwork and galleries in Bushwick you ever knew about. He was (sort of) on a quest to be invited to be a part of a show but at first was too polite to ask.,He’s created deck designs for Consolidated Skateboards for over 7 years, produces freely distributed zines of original pop art, and is now getting his full sized artworks into art shows around the neighborhood. The first of which was a one night affair at Silky’s Skate Shop in the Loom replete with McDonalds’s burgers and fries as hors d’oeuvres., I tell people that I’m an artist. I work fulltime at a jewelry store. I ride a skateboard. I guess that’s what defines me., Do you work at Silky’s or do you silkscreen there?, I don’t work there. I’m friends with them, they let me silkscreen there. I hang out while they print my shirts., So if I went there now I could find your shirts and zines?, Yeah., How did you get into producing your zines?, I wanted to be in art shows. But I didn’t have the space to produce large pieces and I didn’t know how you get in an art show. So each zine would be a themed art show for myself. It’s easily accessible by people and I can just hand them out.,That’s kind of how that started. You know the Sexy Olympics, the Sexy Man book, etc., You put together a , of a lot of different art shows that you went to around the neighborhood. How many shows would you say you’ve been to in the past year?, Uhh… All of them. [laughs] I don’t know, a lot. Sometimes there would be five or six shows a night and I would map out my schedule of where I’m going in Bushwick and what my path is to other shows so… I went to a lot of them., Can you name any favorites off the top of your head?, The one I went to in the video where they’re doing the butt flexing. That was… you know where the church space is? That performance was diagonal across the street from that church. They had a bunch of cool performances that night.,They were friendly. That was another thing. There are a lot of shows you go to where the gallery is just starting out and everyone there will be friends with each other. So you might not get acknowledged unless you’re outgoing yourself and it sometimes feels weird., How many shirts have you designed? You wear a lot of your designs, but you always have something different., Before I started doing my own apparel, I would design shirts for other companies. So I have a lot from that. Now that I started my company I have eight designs that I’ve released publicly.,There’s a lot of one offs that I made for myself. I just wanted more control over what was on my shirt and didn’t want to wear someone else’s logo., When you were out and about, you said that you didn’t know how to get into art shows., Yeah., Did you ever think about just asking if you could be in a show?, No.,[both laughing],Because, I didn’t think that my art was good enough. I would set all these arbitrary goals, one thing I thought was that I had to get a studio before I could have a show.,I guess I was looking for validation from galleries and thinking that someone would ask me. I don’t know if that was ever going to happen. So I called up Silky’s three days before the first Friday at the Loom and asked if I could have my own show in their space., Did you pass out your zines at the art shows?, Sometimes. At first I wouldn’t because I thought it would insulting for me to show up and start handing out my artwork to everybody. It started in bars and coffee shops. There are five different zines and I’ve made 100 of each., How did you get involved with Consolidated Skateboards?, Persistence. I called them, emailed, and mailed them drawings. I kept doing that over and over until they finally used some. By then their art director quit and I knew the process of how to submit the board design so it could be silk-screened, so I started doing a lot. One year I did twenty designs. Now it’s about one or two a year., Why didn’t you go that route when you were wanting to get you art into the galleries?, I thought about it. When I was working with Consolidated I lived in a really small town and these designs would be sold all across the world. But the only feedback I’d get was “Oh this is awesome.”,Or if I saw someone skating I could say I designed that and they’d say “Oh that’s awesome.”,So even though my work was seen all over the world, the feedback I got was a few people telling me it was pretty cool. I didn’t have much self value attached to my art at the time., How did you come up with the McDonalds French Fry wrappers for the zines during the show at Silky’s?, Well, one of my characters is Ronald McDonald. I called them up and ordered $100 bucks worth of food. It didn’t faze them. I didn’t want to do the normal wine and cheese thing, and people ate it up. There weren’t any burgers left after that show., Any parting thoughts?, Look at my work. I’m going to try to be in more shows so that people can see them in person.",Sean Alday is a writer originally from the Florida Keys and now residing in Bushwick.

Music,"“You bloody New Yorkers…You have it too good,” Peter Murphy said onstage at The Well with the most charismatic British accent you can imagine. I had to agree. This past Sunday, I was surrounded by the most stylish, eclectic mix of hipsters and Goths, all enjoying the show alike.,There is something magical about ,. Every concert there feels like a special occasion. And it actually is. The Well, located in a former warehouse on Meserole Street has been a pioneer in bringing the world-class musicians to our dingy part of Brooklyn. But that’s not the only reason why the happenings at The Well feel so special. The interiors of The Well haven’t been shown to the public yet, and all the concerts of this summer have taken place in a gigantic yard, which is surrounded by construction panels and concrete machinery. When the sun starts to set there, the light turns golden and the industrial wasteland feels so romantically dystopian…The Well is magical. Completely.,Small Black were just hitting the very peak of their performance when I bumped into Brad Hargett from Crystal Stilts. He was simply walking through the yard and chilling, giving me a “yeah-that’s-me” kind of smile and, in fact, there was something very natural and nice about it. I later took a photo of Brad and his girlfriend watching Peter Murphy’s act. Small Black, a cult Brooklyn chillwave band were really cool, making the crowd sway on their new single ,. Later, when Crystal Stilts played, they almost played me once again.  , ,If you’re into ‘80s music, you’ve surely heard of Bauhaus, who are considered to be the first gothic rock band. Peter Murphy used to be the singer of Bauhaus. When the band broke up, he began his solo career and a couple of other significant projects (Dali’s Car). You’re guessing correctly that he was the one who attracted all the Goths to The Well that afternoon. I have to say, I really enjoyed seeing such a dedicated fan base. I couldn’t hide my amazement with the accessories and details of the outfit of the lady in the first picture above. “Oh, that’s nothing, hun,” she said and laughed heartily., ,I am sure that Peter Murphy was aware of the arrival of his die-hards and he did a lot to create an intimate atmosphere at the industrial yard. He ordered the pro photographers to stop photographing during his performance (oh well, that’s alright). He also interacted a lot with the audience, threw in a bunch of anecdotes and seemed to really have communicated with the crowd on an emotional level. And when performing, Peter Murphy was simply classy. He didn’t go on a ride and just shut the door like we see often with younger bands. Peter Murphy surely went on that ride – but he took the audience with him., , , , , , , , , , ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

Music,"Lively DIY scene is one of the best things about Bushwick! People host parties in their loft apartments and rock shows in their living rooms with cheap (or free!) booze. This past Saturday, the second floor of a former cheap storage space off the Jefferson Stop was the venue for ,. Aputumtu showcases (mostly) rising Brooklyn bands, and this Saturday’s performances featured Gypsy Wigs, Life Size Maps, Gunfight!, Osekre and The Lucky Bastards, and headliners AVAN LAVA. WC Kids DJ’ed awesome pop songs for the growing crowd between each set. All the bands are from the Bushwick area, except Gypsy Wigs who are from across the Hudson in New Jersey.,The lively atmosphere and colorful stage made this showcase intriguing.  Although the crowd was slowly coming to the showcase by the third act (Life Size Maps) the crowd was reasonably large. During the show alcohol was plentiful and cheap as they had a sponsorship from Brooklyn Brewery, which kindly served the audience free beer from 8-9:30PM., , , ,The show commenced with New Jersey’s very own Gypsy Wigs’ African-inspired tunes which reminded me a bit of Vampire Weekend and concluded with AVAN LAVA’s electropop dance music and laser show that got the crowd grooving the rest of the night away., , ,Breakout Sessions V has done itself justice in terms of putting on a good show and exposing great up and coming bands to the public. The performance by Life Size Maps’ synthesized noise pop melodies made me a fan, thus making me heart one of their songs on ,.

During the remainder of the evening, I began to think of my friends who were unfortunately not in the crowd and I just had to send them a link to Gunfight!’s upbeat southern rock music (that made me tap my toes as if this NYC kid grew up in the South), and Osekre and the Lucky Bastards African punk sound so they could appreciate it as much as I did.,Aputumpu will be rounding out its BreakOut Summer Sessions on September 29th.

Arts and Culture," and , invited me up to their Williamsburg rooftop to discuss ,, the borough-wide open studio event/contest for a show at the Brooklyn Museum stirring criticisms, excitement, and curiosity. One reason for skepticism is that 1,806 artists registered for it, while 4,500+ did for Bushwick Open Studios. The most compelling reason for interviewing them was that Jane is participating in GO! and James is not, despite having been collaborating under the alias , for years, sharing a studio, and being married. Jane and James have both been working artists in Brooklyn since the late eighties., After thinking about it, I ended up feeling like if I didn’t participate and I saw whoever got the show and felt like there work was awful, I know I would’ve been kicking myself for not doing it.,: I feel like at this point in my artistic career, my studio is not really the best representation of my work. To some artists it’s less attractive. Plus we’re not in a building with a bunch of studios in it so not many people are going to come through. You also have to walk through mine in order to get to Jane’s anyway, so I guess it’s not all that bad.,: Yeah a Canadian friend of ours knew about it, and she asked if we were doing it and I said “what are you talking about?” Then we were in Bushwick later that day and I guess they had flooded Bushwick with the fliers, and that’s when we saw the deadline had passed. A week later she emailed me and said the extended the deadline, so we had about 3 days to decide. The strange thing about it is that James and I and the , artists and those who have had reasonably professional careers didn’t even know about it. It seems so professional now. It’s beautifully organized, and it’s not that we should’ve been a priority, but it was just a bunch of emails, and why didn’t anyone get some of us on the phone instead? Is their intention to make it a success and then in the next years everyone wants to be a part of it?,: I think whether or not it’s a success isn’t really going to determine the quality of the show. It should be more a celebration of artists working in Brooklyn. The idea of having a Brooklyn group show that takes place across the whole borough over two days and it just happens to take place in people’s studios, that’d be a really interesting idea. Then you’d also be showing art in a different context, because it’s in studios., Oh yeah Bushwick is going to get the most foot traffic for sure. And then whoever can get the most people to come to their studios is more likely to ‘win’ the show.,: Well there was Open House in 2004 at the Brooklyn Museum. Charlotta Kotik, the curator, it was her idea and in the beginning she said it wasn’t going to be a big salon show. As the months went by, we were lucky to each get two pieces in the show.,: There was also the Salon of the Mating Spiders exactly 20 years ago in 1992 curated by Annie Herron, over on North 1st between Berry and Wythe. It was just an open call to come bring your work and hang it yourself. By the time the doors opened, the line was around the corner. There was literally not a square inch of room from the floors to the ceiling that wasn’t covered with art.,In addition to these shows, the introduction to the Open House catalogue mentions the Gallery for Living Artists, “an exhibition space devoted to the work of those living and working in Brooklyn” in the 1930′s, exhibitions in the early eighties in the Gowanus Canal Art Yard, the , which featured over 200 artists, many from the East Village, which happened in a 32,000 square foot loft in Greenpoint. Another bring-and-install-your-work show happened at the Brooklyn Army Terminal in Sunset Park in 1983.,Though GO! Brooklyn Art is a very unconventional approach to a curated museum show, maybe it takes something this rewarding and accessible to open the closed doors of the thousands of Brooklyn artists to the public. Maybe some are refusing participation out of principle. All in all, no one will be harmed by an open studio weekend, or a show at the Brooklyn Museum. And it does provide an amazing opportunity to all those underrepresented artists out there. So if you are an aesthetic individual, make sure to stop by ,s studio, and say hi to James when you walk through his.","Artist, gallerist, and bike enthusiast.","Arts and Culture,Bushwick,drawing,Featured,gallery,gobrooklynart,Happening,painting,williamsburg","

This morning, in a beautiful moment of serendipity that mirrored the same bit of peculiar logic of ,I stumbled upon the words I was looking for in this quote from Oliver Sacks in his article in the August 27, New Yorker entitled ,where he describes the , for a project like ,in ways I could never quite sum up:, ,was created as an homage to my first gallerist, Colin De Land, and his ground breaking gallery ,In 1986, I had the great fortune to be a part of the beginning of De Land’s amazing endeavors, and I went on to exhibit and collaborate with him for over a decade. During this time I came to witness firsthand the ways that playfulness, and “letting go” can open up powerful states of creativity. He and his partner (later wife) Pat Hearn of the Pat Hearn Gallery went on to found not only their own unique and powerful art galleries, first in the East Village, and then later in SoHo, but also other incredible concepts like the Gramercy Hotel art fair, which originated the idea that the art fair booth ,, rather than necessitating travel to a distant city, like Basel or Cologne, and taking on all the expenses of participating in a fair,Now since done to death, this model was at the time enormously risky, and having been present at the first one, where I sat on a bed talking to a few of the attendees about a drawing of mine that was in the bathroom, I can say with certainty it seemed a poor model for future success. Later, he and Pat helped create the Armory Fair, and it too at that time seemed a project doomed for failure, just like all past attempts to hold a contemporary art fair in New York City had been. The West Side piers was at that time no one’s idea of a “hotspot” for gathering hundreds of galleries and tens of thousands of viewers from around the world., , ,The lessons I learned from these and the other things I saw were, first, to look for “the future” in unlikely places, places most everyone else had decided weren’t worth paying attention to, and second, to not try to replicate other past successful platforms, but instead “let go” of pre-conceived ideas and let your mind…drift.,After his untimely death in 2002, and Pat’s in 2001, I wanted desperately to re-imagine what Colin might do with the collapse of the art economy and wondered what he might now think of how his own successful attempts at changing the ways in which the art world perceives itself had become two more cogs in the machinery of normative culture.,I started to realize how his concept of “letting go” of fears and expectations was essential, and I embraced his willingness to critically inspect “the rules”, all the protocols that govern our daily art behaviors. None of this mattered, though, until I came to Bushwick in 2006 after having spent 23 years in Williamsburg. It’s here that I discovered the same artists and galleries thinking, talking and working in ways I had long since come to believe did not exist anymore. These incredibly thoughtful, risk taking individuals were creating the future; freshly graduated 25 year-old creative minds alongside 60 year-old former “whatevers”, from stockbrokers to recovering artists and everybody in between, all inside a thriving, ethnically diverse community. Most of them seemed completely uninterested in auditioning for somewhere else (Chelsea, Wall Street, the usual aspirant ranks). Most simply decided to , where they were and take the chance to create a new model of what was possible. For an example of this new spirit, look no further than the now-famous Roberta’s, a literal “hole-the-wall” pizzeria on the surface, but that once opened up shows itself to be something much more: a tiki bar, an urban garden, a radio station; an establishment that is open sourced, unpretentious, and deeply responsive to the needs of its community. This is the template of what Bushwick can be.,It is another question, though, whether this spirit can be maintained. It will require a delicate balance that I am at times wildly hopeful for, and at others profoundly pessimistic about. I am, at the very least, lucky enough to have witnessed this change taking place and I hope that , will play its own small part in it. I look forward to reading here in the coming months about the different opinions and perspectives from others from this same place called Bushwick., ",Peter Hopkins is an artist and gallery director at The Bogart Salon.,"Armory,Bushwick,citydrift,Colin De Land,Gramercy Hotel art fair,guest writer,Happening,Peter Hopkins,The Bogart Salon","

Arts and Culture,"Local artist and activist , was apparently approached by CNN’s marketing team to show a piece of art in pixels in their online art gallery. Since the dawn of the internet the online art gallery has been attempted, first in HTML form and moving into Flash and CSS forms. Since Apple Inc. declared war on Adobe Flash, the quality of these online galleries fluctuated wildly and with great hiccups.,It would seem that fuller scale mainstream acceptance is coming now that CNN (even at 2nd and 3rd place in the ratings struggle) is adopting the platform. This could have been mistaken for a one off fling with art, as it began last year with the 9/11 Ripple show to mark the tenth anniversary of the attack on the World Trade Centers.,However, , has decided to keep alive their tradition of spectacle and gimmickry with a presidential election , themed around power.

That’s a big to do item,” Chelsey says while sitting on a Victorian couch in her studio. The interior of the salon isn’t complete yet, but it’s clearly shaping up. A beautiful chandelier is Chelsey’s pride; distressed hardwood floors, subway-tilled walls, reclaimed wood features discreetly show Chelsey’s excellent taste., , ,Chelsey, only 28, explains that she has been working in the coloring industry for 10 years now. She is from Portland, Oregon, and moved to New York City, and most importantly to Bushwick, 4 years ago. “I really believe in this neighborhood,” she says. Chelsey has apprenticed under legendary Laurie Foley and worked in her L’Atelier de Laurie. She has mastered the painting technique, which is unlike regular coloring – it’s gentle on the hair and allows for a much more detailed and precise approach. Chelsey explains that hand painting is something completely different. The session takes about 6 hours, and the price is, as you can expect, in the higher range. “I have clients flying in from Texas for example,” says Chelsey. She is expecting clients from Manhattan, but is also very open to the clients from this neighborhood. Chelsey explains that Pickthorn is not a factory; she will have only three chairs. She dedicates a lot of attention to each client, trying to bewitch their hairstyle to match their personality, make their dreams come true and simply create “a better version of you.”, , , , , , ,[mappress mapid=""78""]","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

People,"“What is your biggest dream?” Maybe to the surprise of many, most of the Bushwick artists wouldn’t reply “international stardom” or “wealth,” but rather simply, “not having have to go to my day job, and living off my art.”,Unlike the hundreds who strive for the myth of creative life without the need to have a day job, Bushwick-based artist Steven Charles managed to do it. He lived in the spotlights of fancy Chelsea galleries for 10 years.,“I wasn’t rich,” says Steven, “but I was painting everyday without having to worry about my rent.” Steven was scooped from a Williamsburg gallery Pierogi directly by Marlborough. A Chelsea-based gallery offered exclusive representation, which sounded almost too good to be truth. “I had a full show every two years,” says Steven with eyes wide open. Looking at Steven’s meticulously detailed work, I understand that he had to produce a painting after painting like a machine in order to be able to do it. The trick is that truly creative work requires spaciousness of mind, and continuous work in a crazy pace can sometimes cause you to burn out and lose your inner fire. Steven sighs deeply and I gather that the art world isn’t always only about art. It’s a business in the first place., , ,However, Steven’s fate wasn’t to be at Marlborough forever. His fate has been twisted by the recession that hit the art world hard. In combination with reasons of a personal nature, Steven decided to quit the gallery and continue on his own without a gallery representation. “At first, it was tough,” Steven says. His art was still selling, but he also had to get a part-time job to make sure he could pay his bills. “They were asking me what I was doing during that 10-year long gap,” Steven recalls his unplanned job hunt. “It looked really suspicious to them that I only painted. They thought I was hiding something. I don’t know…that I was in prison or something,” Steven continues. Eventually, Steven found a job to put him in a stable place, and he currently works 2 to 3 days per week in catering and maintenance. The rest of his week is dedicated to what he loves the most – to painting., , , ,Steven Charles’ soul probably looks something like his art. It’s colorful, lively and giggling at a bunch of insider jokes. If you look closely and patiently you will see hundreds of amazing details and colors. A “lightness of being,” his colorful schemes that stroke one’s soul, little provocations by orange fur here and there, some tickling glitter – Steven Charles is an analogue child who discovered the 8-bit world of the first PC., ,Another milestone in Steven’s life is his “Bushwick Rebirth.” He moved to a shared work/live loft on Melrose Street and couldn’t be happier. “I love it here, and I’m so happy to be part of this!” Steven says passionately. He seems to be more creative than ever. Maybe it’s because Steven really likes his housemates, or maybe because of the Laundromat right under his building (“I’m SO lucky!”), but my humble guess is that it is because Bushwick is real. Bushwick art scene is about art and Bushwick life is about life. Simple.,Steven’s work has attracted many excited viewers in Bushwick. In June and July, Steven Charles showed at , at 56 Bogart and in , on Wilson Ave. Currently, he is preparing for a show at , in Chelsea, and who knows what else will happen. The Bushwick sun is glowing., , ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily. She can easily be moved by reflection of the sky in a puddle.

At least that’s how I feel about films I want to watch attentively and in their entirety.,It also transitions from a more or less feature-length pilot episode to approximately 45-minute chunks. Quite useful for those threes in the mornings.,When I got to episode 7, anyway, “Catch and Release,” the very first moments had me hitting the pause button. For as the scene fades in, the geographic indication at the bottom reads:,BUSHWICK, NEW JERSEY,This, of course, didn’t seem to make much sense. So I looked it up. It doesn’t seem to make much sense to Google, either. And it’s not in any blunders or factoids on imdb or Netflix—not that I found at the time, at any rate. I did learn a thing or two, though, about a company called Bushwick Metals that has a plant in New Jersey. If you’re looking for punching or drilling equipment, or perhaps carbon steel beams or grating, I know just the 750,000-sf warehouse you might like to visit.,So the Jersey indication was probably just a mistake. The show’s writers should have Bell (if you watch, you know) fact-check such things from now on.,Mistake aside, the nonetheless enjoyable—perhaps even all-the-more enjoyable—episode goes on to feature a somewhat rogue ‘alpha’ character named Skylar who fabricates extraordinarily engineered contraptions out of an industrial adorned with graffiti. You know, DIY-tech-style. She has a number of tattoos and snazzy highlights. She has a bit of snark and anarchist leanings.

People,"Last week we lost stylist/muse/fashion writer futurist extraordinaire, ,. Every generation loses someone pivotal that came before them; a film star, a thought leader, a president, a rock star, those denizens who made it before you and everyone else. They are not to be feared, but they are to be watched…closely. While alive and amongst the living it’s the craziest, most outrageous, vulnerable, and volatile artists that somehow get their points across. Points that burst the bubble, points that make people uncomfortable, and points that break silence. That’s what Bushwick is to me. Crazy, vulnerable, volatile and aching to burst. This neighborhood makes no one comfortable, and that’s the beauty of it.,Since moving to Bushwick in August of 2011, it has taken me awhile to get acclimated to the particular brand of creativity and chaos in the neighborhood.  Fast and cosmically, I was thrust into a lost boy/girl gang of manic, hardworking,,, collaborative, and ambitious individuals that have inspired me to write about them.  They have inspired me to break my own boundaries and veer away from my regular paths of creativity. As a singer, songwriter, beat-maker, and electronic musician, it’s too easy to always surround myself with other musicians. I risk over-specialization if that happens. It’s much healthier for me to challenge myself in writing, to surround myself with stylists, visual artists, poets, photographers, and Martians. These individuals are my muses, my inspirations, future friends, and co-conspirators. They orbit around me and make it possible for me to create sounds, atmospheres, and vocalize what the world is feeling and seeing through music. Oh, and I just simply want the world to know about them too.,The first burst of fruit flavor that caught my attention is ,.  Since arriving in NYC late last year, there’s really no stopping her. There’s more than enough flavor to go around when it comes to her talents. She’s a veteran of the Boston Electronic/Techno/Dance music scene and still operates under the name DJ VOLVOX. When she’s not mixing, spinning, and throwing her particular flavor of parties she busies herself with her hands—that is styling, sculpting, jewelry-making, altering, and creating the future. Paoletti’s state of mind is pure 2012 with a dash of Salvador Dali philosophy. One day while she was styling me for our first ever photo shoot, she quipped, “You know, it’s 2012. It’s supposed to be the future. I don’t understand why every bar in Williamsburg is designed like it’s supposed to look like the goddamn 1800’s. What’s going on here?!?”  Classic.,After throwing events and DJing as well as selling vintage clothing independently for several years in Boston, I hit the ceiling of what was possible career-wise in those fields.

So many amazing textures and prints. It really made we want to launch a line of leather bags! I find materials inspire my pieces. I collect all sorts of fabrics, findings, crystals and random bits then sit with them all around me and start to put things together.,Perhaps my greatest life influence is Salvador Dali, he is always reminding me to keep it classy, and keep it weird. In the realm of fashion right now I have been looking closely at the work of , from the 1960’s. I love how he has a background in movement and dance, and also his clan of collaborators; his model/muse , their photographer/Peggy’s husband , and the iconic hair cut by , himself which defined Peggy’s mod look. I enjoy designers who operate in a family-like creative atmosphere. The love of all the collaborators really shines through I think!, , ,I’d definitely say my aesthetic overall is very much influenced by particular threads of electronic music history, though I also collect images like a crazy person-photos from fashion history as well as industrial design, science and nature. When I’m actually working on making something I always use music to put me into another realm, whether it expansive mesmerizing Techno or a freaky Acid track.,How many awesome warehouse parties are going on all the time. In Boston we are psyched to maintain ONE raw underground space to have events in, and the cops are always coming in and shutting things down and sending everyone home. It just ends up stifling creative development within the underground.,Coming from a place as lush and verdant as Boston, the lack of real grass, trees and plants around is much harder on me than I expected. Then there’s the trash everywhere, festering in the sun, it’s disgusting! Also dealing with anything municipal in New York is just insane. In Massachusetts I had great healthcare for free. In New York, getting any sort of medical attention is a nightmare and always leaves me feeling rather helpless.,Sure. Fashion styling is actually a pretty recent development for me, kind of the natural result of having a large collection of clothes and meeting performers who are interested in my visual ideas. I always think of my work as sculpture, whether I’m sculpting a story around a person using clothes and jewelry or sculpting emotions by putting bodies in an environment with lights and music.,Lately, the new , album has been on constant rotation and , as well. I listen to a lot of classic albums, , is one of my favorites, as are , and ,., ,All these characters a similar in a way, each representing the counterculture of their respective eras.

The vast stretches of concrete are punctuated with roller door garages and giant storage facilities. I mean this in the nicest possible way: Bushwick has about as much charm as a shipping container. I think I’ve been in need of some pastoral therapy lately because I’m not a New York native and my Astroturf backyard just isn’t cutting it. To my utter delight, when I rode along Flushing Ave looking for Onderdonk Farmhouse I found just that. A farmhouse. A bona fide house-on-the-prairie wet dream.,The house dates back to 1709 and has been used for some pretty varied purposes. The site has been scrap glass depository, a geranium nursery, and a shop that supplied machines to the Apollo space program. It is now a museum and occasionally hosts flea markets and music festivals.,And the ,? Well, after ongoing disputes, in 1769 a rock was placed on the property to officially mark the Brooklyn/Queens boarder. The boarder has since moved but the rock remains.,So that’s the history bit. Let’s talk festivities. There were bands playing from midday till almost midnight. Beers were generously priced at three bucks and dogs were welcome (my favourite part). In between sets there were rounds of limbo and a more obscure Dutch game called ‘Spike a Poope’, which involved inserting a nail into an empty beer bottle from a backwards-squatted position.,Hmmm. Maybe not one for the museum walls., , ,If you haven’t yet had the pleasure, I really recommend a trip to the Farmhouse. Either take a weekend tour (and catch the flea market) or wait till the next festival., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ",,"Arbitration Rock Festival,Backwords,Featured,Happening,Katarina Hybenova,Not Blood Paint,Onderdonk Farm House,Pass Kontrol,photo essay,Therese Maher","

Music," ,Bizarre ethos, synthesizers, weird gadgets obtained via eBay, girls, UFOs, experimental process. Electronic band , is celebrating their freshly released album in all their Bushwick weirdness this , at ,. The night named after their album ,, will feature 4 other bands of a similar experimental mindset (Water Brain, Rarefaction, H.Honne Wells and Fall of Another Year).,You probably saw Paradise Club performing in ,, , or , last Thursday. The band is also preparing a collaboration with Jason Andrew and , on an installment of , series. Before we see Paradise Club in action, we used this opportunity to chat with the members of the band, Eric Trosko and Kiowa Hammons, about their creative process, their inspiration for the album, and mainly why cars on fire…, We have been making music together and with other people for a number of years now. There was just a point where it was just us two left and we decided to let machines do the work that would have been done by other members. This really freed things up and allowed us to engage in the kind of experimentation and discovery that we had always wanted to. This is when Paradise Club really came into being in the springtime of 2011., It felt like we were both struggling to incorporate more chaotic elements and performance art practices into the music we were making, and the decision to just start from scratch with a new name, line-up, and instrumentation really opened up the possibilities for a new sound. There can be a lot of clichés associated with branding a collaboration as a “band”—mostly associated with the celebritization of musical groups brought on by rock and pop, and that’s not where we wanted to go with this project. But I think we’ve sort of achieved a good balance between what essentially makes a “band”—which is people making music together, with trying to create something more bizarre and unique by bringing in the elements of more art based practices; such as performative actions, visual art, weird manifestos, etc…, while still incorporating a band ethos into the music. This helps to connect the sounds to people as somewhat structured songs with ideas, motifs, and emotions embedded in.,I like to think of bands as little mini-cults—a group of people who believe in certain ideas spend a concentrated amount of time building on said ideas and create different ways to express them, then the group start preaching these ideas to the people in the hopes that they’ll believe in them to. The interaction of ideas and energy grow into a collective unconscious, channeled through sounds, and then you have something., 2 synthesizers, 2 vocalists, 1 guitar, 1 saxophone., This is like trying to describe a mugger for a police sketch or something…so far I think we’ve kind of hidden behind naming the music and musicians that have influenced us rather than trying to put the actual sounds into words. I’d like to think of our music achieving a visceral effect similar to the distortion of sound when under water, or the audio physicality of a good nitrous oxide trip. Eric a while back just started calling it “Soft Skull”, I think it is good to have a new way to describe something new., ,: I don’t really have a favorite. I have the most experience with guitar but it really only plays a minor role at the moment. The Minimoog is really the backbone of our sound on this release. It is the starting point of everything we do. I am hoping to incorporate more instruments in the future.,: For me it’s the saxophone. I find that the tone of the instrument can both blend in with the atonal nuances as well as punctuate the more chaotic noises of the music in interesting ways. Plus I enjoy the physical challenge of the instrument; particularly its connection to human breath. There reaches a point with these songs that I feel like I’m going to pass out, and that’s when I know that we are playing at our best., It is the best results of our experimental process. We wanted to entertain ideas that are largely out of favor and fit them into the form of a pop song. Basically most of the music we hear today sounds like it is made for pussies; we are inspired by our opposition to this. The pop song format with all its convention is still the best way to advance the anti-pussy agenda. We try to keep it real and tactile. Real sound, real pain, real joy, real love, real dreams, no pussies…, The album is sort of a layer cake of different noises and atonal drones stacked and blended together to make something akin to a song. Sort of like looking at a cartoon rendition of the earth’s soil: you have the inner and outer cores, the mantle and the crust, with some dinosaur fossils, oil, and dirt; all crushed and fused together—now just think of this diagram as an audio experience…Lyrically, we tend to write songs about what we know: girls, political strife, and UFO’s.,There wasn’t any one particular thing that influenced the making of the album, beyond just coming to a point where we had been playing these songs awhile, and the order of the songs fit, so it was like “when are we going to record this stuff?” Plus we were able to work with our friend and master sound guru, Lou Sherman, so the pieces just fell into place., ,: No matter what I am making it is always the same approach. Musical sound is just another material to work with. What I like about working with musical sound is it exists in time, space, and can even be felt, yet it remains invisible. I think of our songs more as places that can be visited rater that something to just listen to. I like the collaboration of music rather than just toiling away alone in an art studio.,:  Looking at music and being in a band as more of an artistic project, similar to creating a painting or sculpture but with sounds, seemed like a better outlook to produce the music that we were trying to create.,: We are a Bushwick band. These streets with their once desolate warehouses and factory canyons and its whore-lined streets are our inspiration. 12 years ago burning cars were as common as overpriced cafes are now. “Soundtrack to a Car on Fire” is a fairy tale of an apocalypse long past.,: When a car burns it takes some time as the metal slowly melts and its flammable guts ignite. In my mind’s eye I can picture the act of a car (or any object for that matter) burning with a certain rhythm pattern; with the sight of the flames flickering and the thing itself slowly smoldering… creating a sort of visual opera. Our music has that kind of beat to it—long intervals of entropic destruction leading to a dead simmer and stillness—leaving only junk and ash and fumes for someone to sweep up.,[mappress mapid=""75""]","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

Food and Drink,"Being from Florida, I’m often asked to explain what grits are. This happens enough that it is a cliché, but it’s a very real cliché. My explanation is generally followed by a puzzled look that appears to ask “Why would someone eat that?”,To be fair, grits are ground corn that is boiled, served very hot and generally with eggs in the morning.,Now I can just point my curious foodie friends to Mama Joy’s and tell them to order the Shrimp and Grits or the Beef Cheek.,The dark lights and casual atmosphere often lull me into a whiskey and beer soaked evening. Before I realize it the world has blurred away, it’s three in morning and I’m stepping outside with the bartender for a smoke. It was during these smoke breaks with Bob that I learned , Mama Joy herself and that most of the core staff from Mama Joy’s met through Reddit.,The interior is like an old pirate ship in some respects, with the peeled away walls revealing studs and the mirrors behind the bar looking like port holes. But there are certain flourishes such as the eucalyptus on each table and the long bar that gives each patron space (unless it gets really crowded) that touch off the southern angle they’re going for.,Being a barfly doesn’t mean that one would be excused for not trying that food, at the very least one must sample the hushpuppies. Hushpuppies are another southern delight that I associate strongly with frying freshly caught catfish. Another corn creation, hushpuppies are made from a cornmeal batter (here with celery, corn and jalepeños added to the mix) that is then deep fried. They come with a dipping sauce that makes the hushpuppies worth having every time.,The menu is small but fits in a multitude of soul food specialties courtesy of Chef Nick. The first of which I sampled was the Braised Beef Cheek. Absolutely delicious and on that night it was paired with Triple Smoke Whiskey (which I’ve , before). However, the Triple Smoke has been replaced with an interesting choice from Texas called Brimstone. If you aren’t interested in trying grits, one alternative is the Pork Duo which is served like a cake on top of cornbread with cherries as the dressing.,Your vegan friends might feel left out at this point, luckily, a Roasted Mushroom entrée will allow you bring them by at least once. If that doesn’t do it, the eight beers on tap and great selection of liquor will have to do. With options like that, it’s tough to complain.,It’s being , overtly stated that a few changes may be coming to Mama Joy’s mostly in the form of a backyard and silly clambakes. One thing will remain the same: You will definitely see me at the bar with my drinks, hushpuppies and boiled peanuts.",Sean Alday is a writer originally from the Florida Keys and now residing in Bushwick.

In Bushwick, we report less events than on very productive weeks but this week’s events are truly awesome, which in the end is an equation we like. Here is what you should not miss!,Here at Bushwick Daily, we are really proud because we are helping to put up some really weird experimental electronic bands. It started with Paradise Club, a band of Eric Trosko and Kiowa Hammons, who just recently released their debut album titled ,(note: we love the name among other things). So we were like, hey why don’t we do a release party, and Paradise Club were like hey, why don’t we invite more bands. This Thursday, at 8pm the madness starts at Brooklyn Fire Proof.

Fashion & Shopping,"Like any freelancer, I’ve spilled coffee into my keyboard upon being bumped by an excited grad student in a crowded café. This kind of encounter has made me hate The Arcade Fire at times, usually because the excitement is borne out hearing “Wake Up” for the 10,000th time. I want to say “I know that you love this album! So do I and everyone else we could possibly know!”,I met Cody Sullivan and Natalie Chan after an Arts in Bushwick meeting at their clubhouse for freelancers called ,. Bat Haus is a co-working space for people who don’t have an office or studio and are in need a more professional setting than the usual café or bar scene that freelancers generally populate.,After a quick conversation I learned that Natalie studied philosophy of the mind biology in Austin, Texas. She then moved to New York and studied fine art at SVA. Cody studied analytical philosophy and English Literature in Rhode Island. Then I turned on the recorder:, That’s why we hit it off. Asking, “Did you study Kant or…” [laughs]., We both grew disillusioned with philosophy for similar reasons, lack of employment in the field, having a change of heart.,My main passion is writing fiction. But for work I do copywriting and I had a friend who helped me get a fulltime job in New York copy writing. Then some friends started a clothing company, I did some work for them.,Unfortunately, the company went under and I started doing freelance work. That’s when I got a taste for what it’s like to not have an office or a community of people anymore. I did the café culture, which is great in a way but it’s very unpredictable. Also, if you take yourself seriously as a freelancer, getting work done in a café is tough. There are a lot of distractions, the other thing is, especially in Williamsburg and this area, I’ve gone to four cafés in a row and they’re all filled up. By then you’ve wasted one to two hours of your time. If you do that every day it becomes exhausting., He’d come home and say “I can’t do this anymore.” One day I said, “Let’s do something about it.”,So we did a lot of research and found out about the co-working movement. There’s a lot of support for it, from different cities and they have regular meetings. We went to some and it seemed like a great idea.,I walked down this street (Starr Street) every day to take the subway to work and would look at this building. One day it was open and I looked inside, I thought it was pretty cool.,I used Loopnet, an application for commercial listings and found out that there was one space open on this street. It turned out to be this one, the one that I looked at first.,So we met with the broker and set about securing the space. We almost lost it. We were so upset, wondering who put the deposit down before us. But it turned out that the landlord was more interested in what we wanted to do with it, since we weren’t putting in a restaurant or a bar there would be less things to convert back once the lease was up., We jumped on this really fast too. So we aren’t coming into this with our community already formed or anything., We like that though, we wanted the community to form organically via word-of-mouth.,Cody has a writer’s meetup on Wednesdays called Write the Night for example. It’s a good chance for people to form an idea of what this space can be. The people coming to the writer’s meetup don’t necessarily have to be members but they can see what it’s like and meet people who do work here.,It’s a very different feeling than working from home, which we used to do. We have roommates so we know how hard it is to set up a corner office. Or to get work done when the cat jumps in your lap and the kitchen is so close and there’s always a good time to take a nap [laughs]., If you need that moment of professionalism we have the conference room. Most freelancers can’t bring a client back to their apartment., My friend is a freelance photographer. Try saying to someone, “Hey do you want to come back to my apartment to shoot?” Well no.,I want to offer people a second home base with more professionalism and more support.,[smiling] And we have barbecues., ,[mappress mapid=""74""]",Sean Alday is a writer originally from the Florida Keys and now residing in Bushwick.

Fashion & Shopping,"If herbs and flowers in gritty industrial Bushwick are a contradiction, then finding an herbal apothecary off Morgan L stop may feel like a little miracle. Gentle herbalist Anit Hora founded , from her apartment, and since then has created a beautiful line of handmade herbal products. She sells them on her ,, in an , and in several shops in Brooklyn (in Bushwick it’s Loom Yoga and Better Than Jam).,I gladly accepted the invitation to Anit’s apartment where all the magic happens. She transformed one room of her quiet and tidy apartment on Flushing Avenue into an herbology studio. As simple as it sounds, there is a solid wooden table in the middle of the room, a window that offers the cheap luxury of a royal view over typical Brooklyn water towers and roofs of warehouses; the walls are covered with shelves that carry neatly organized empty bottles and cans waiting to be filled and labeled. One section of shelving is dedicated only to herbs that Anit needs at hand. “But there are way more herbs in the storage,” she smiles., , ,While serving lovely ice cold chamomile tea, Anit patiently poured an herbal mixture into empty cans and revealed her story. “I used to work in fashion design,” Anit began. “It was so corporate that after some time I felt like my soul was slowly dying.” Anit founded Mullein and Sparrow in spring 2012, but the journey began much earlier. Five years ago she quit her fashion job and simply left. “I travelled in South America for a year and half,” Anit smiles. It was around the time of her travels that she became interested in natural medicine and herbs. She didn’t want to rely on traditional artificial medicine, so she began to search for ways of making simple cures from herbs. She points to the flasks filled with natural coughing syrup labeled Mullein and Sparrow and she smiles. After she returned to New York, she felt her calling strongly then ever. She would become an herbalist. “How does one become an herbalist?” I asked her. “I signed up for a course, but they don’t really teach you how to make stuff. They teach you how to work in a spa, which is nice, but I needed to know how to make this…” Driven by pure passion (and you can call it an obsession if you’d like) she began to study everything she found online or offline. Herbology, mixtures, tinctures, herbs, flowers, roots, simply everything. “But above all I like it really girly,” says Anit about her lip glosses, dry shampoos and herbal water in a spray. Anit uses her skills from fashion design to create beautiful labels and to generally make her products look really pretty. “We get most of the herbs from a supplier from West Coast, ”  says Anit; she also adds that she loves to collect them Upstate whenever she can, although that’s more for her own pleasure as the amounts are not sufficient.,While Anit sells her products online and supplies to several Brooklyn shops, her dream is to open an herbal shop in Bushwick. “For the moment it’s not possible,” says Anit, but you can feel the energy around her and the desire of her heart, and so one has to believe that what’s not possible today, can easily be reality tomorrow., , , , , , , , , ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

Food and Drink,"There are two things about , that stand out especially upon the first visit:,One of which is how non-descript the outside is. There is a folding sign placed out on the street, a recessed entrance, and two chairs on either side of an ashcan with a stag on it.,The second thing you’ll notice is how that stag has found his way onto the wall in the form of gold and red wallpaper. According to the owners, the idea behind Alaska’s decor was to give it a frontier feel. It was shortly before they opened that they settled on the name. This ideal is helped along by the mounted deer head above the bar. Hopefully, they said, he’ll have company shortly.,Lisa traveled to several flea markets in the tristate area to find the oil paintings of farm houses and rustic scenes that decorate the wall above a row of booths. When you’re seated there, be sure to look down as well, they made the tables themselves.,It’s a spacious bar, dimly lit and has many little design details to pay attention to. Also, being that it’s around the corner from , you may soon catch a few art heads in there having a drink and a chat.,Over a selection of bourbons, beers, house drinks [try the Alaska if you're in the mood for gin], and Bourbon Milkshakes, we sat down with the proprietors, Skyler and Lisa, to find out about their new space and how it came about., This used to be a biker bar, a clubhouse might be a better way to put it. When we first walked into the space there was a mezzanine. I don’t know what it was before that.,Lisa and I met in the McKibbin lofts at a music show about four years ago. The idea for this began really taking shape about a year ago., We really wanted to set up a venue space. Even a DIY venue, because we have a lot of friends in the local music scene, especially the Potion Collective. Slowly we came around to the idea of having a bar instead. One of the first questions Skyler asked was “What bourbon will we serve?”, Bourbon is my favorite drink. We have a really good selection right now, but we want to add more. [author's note: Wild Turkey is always a good choice, but ask for the bottle behind the prominent one.],We also want to add more taxidermied animals. We have the deer above the bar and an animal that’s sparked some debate, though I think it’s a wolverine., Yeah, the animals have become a new hobby for us. I think we’re most proud of the bar though, Skyler had a lot to do with finding that. It’s made from two pieces of reclaimed wood and was extremely heavy. Skyler found it, brought it in and created the bar from it. It’s really one of the best pieces of the whole room., is located at 35 Ingraham Street between Bogart and Moore.

Arts and Culture,"We’ve all seen , in The Metropolitan Museum of Art, MoMA, and other major museums. Is this a gag? A stunt? Is he the shock jock of street art? Perhaps. But one question he is asking loudly and clearly is, who’s to dub one work museum worthy and one not?,A major criticism in the art world will always be the commercialization of galleries. To the frustration of many talented up and coming artists, these large quiet spaces often come under fire for catering to the wealthy, specifically showing what’s “trendy” over what’s “good,” or art they think might fit in a loft in TriBeCa. What if these bounds were broken, and there was no emphasis on how “good” an artist is based on where their work is shown. What if all types of artists could have shows in notable places? What if you could hang your artwork at next to Van Gogh’s “Starry Night” at MOMA, in the trees at Central Park, or even in the Roman Colosseum? Bushwick based ,may have found a way.,When you think “augmented reality” it’s easy to picture holograms of Michael Jackson and Marilyn Monroe singing next to this year’s American Idol winner. But Skwarek has been exploring how the medium can change the way we think about art since the 1990s. By working with artists who are willing to submit their work to basically, thin air — Skwarek creates art galleries that exist in virtual space. By searching “BOS” on site in a , in specific parts of the city, a viewer can see works that he has specifically placed, in the sky, hanging on buildings, in different venues, etc.,“Back then it was very difficult to do, it wasn’t mobile,” he said, describing huge goggles and backpacks worn by people who wanted to participate in an augmented gallery visit in the 90s. “We developed our own app when the mobile revolution happened, and once it was in everyone’s pocket, all of the artists started jumping on board. It was a major shift.”,So if you’re still wondering about how to get your painting in MoMA, Skwarek spoke about one of his first major and successful exhibitions, an ,created in collaboration with ,. In 2010, he invited the hundreds of people that walk through the museum every day to view new art work in a new way. A disclaimer on the site reads “PS The MoMA is not involved yet.”,“We said [to artists] if you want to send us your artwork, we’ll make a show, we’ll put your work in MoMA, you’ll ,. What came out of that show was not so much about the DIY element, but it was about breaking and questioning the boundaries of one of the most prestigious institutions and the entire gallery system.” ,to viewing art in such a prestigious and traditional institution.,It’s clear that the possibilities for a relationship with augmented reality and traditional art are just about endless. “We’ve put stuff in the White House, we’ve put stuff at the Korean DMZ, I’ve put stuff at the Palestinian Israeli separation barrier. Recently we just removed all of the parthenon marbles from the British museum and returned them to Greece. It has a lot of freedom and you can do big things,” Skwarek reiterated.,But the one place on earth that has possibly the highest concentration of art in augmented reality? Bushwick. Bushwick appears to be a playground and an experimental space for Skwarek and his friends, and one of the most supportive communities for this type of work. Because it seems so steeped in technology, it does beg the question: Should this be classified as art?,“There are some people who are going to be hard to win over, but what’s happening is a shift in the understanding of the virtual and physical space, and it’s happening with the younger generation. The younger generation is starting to understand it because it grew up online, it grew up in the virtual space and it understands this experience as real.”,In addition to both playing with the laws of physics, and challenging the boundaries of art institutions, the project encourages people to get up and get out. While most art and technology platforms make it easier for viewers to never have to actually go to Paris to see the Louvre, (ahem, Google Art Project), one needs to physically be in these spaces to see the work.,The art world will always be in contempt about technology “invading” “traditional” forms of art. But one thing that can’t be argued with is Skwarek’s work in Bushwick is that makes the art world more accessible for artists and art lovers alike, knocking down the barriers that stand in the way of bringing all types of great art to people all over the world.","On a mission to expose the NYC art scene for what it is - fun, inspiring and exciting!

Editor's Pick,"Welcome, dear August. You emerged at our doors requesting a cup of warm beverage because “It’s raining cats and dogs out there.” Oh well, there there, August. Here is a coffee, but beware, it’s little bit bitter, as something’s telling me that summer is going down the hill from your arrival…. Despite or maybe because of that we have some awesome art shows going on in the neighborhood this week. From experimental video to recycled sculpture and roof festivities, here is what we recommend:, ,The “little hangar”- how , called the , of SoHo-based , on Boerum Street, is hosting its second art show.

Food and Drink,"The following statement never gets old: There’s a new bar in town. In this case, the town is Bushwick and the bar is Mazelle.,It has been open to the public for about three months and my impression, when I dropped by recently, was that it has hit the ground running. , , ,It was a late Saturday afternoon and the bar was just starting to attract a crowd. On the corner of Wyckoff and Starr, Mazelle has plenty of foot-traffic and is right off the Jefferson stop. In fact, move their front door six feet to the right and they ARE the Jefferson stop. It’s a pretty sweet spot to set up camp. (And speaking of the word sweet, ask the barman to make you a Botanic Garden.), , , ,On a hunch, I’d say owner Yury Maze knows good food. Like any good New York restaurateur, he brings you the taste of a distant land. Eastern European flavours inspire the menu at Mazelle. The cheese and charcuterie plate offers a selection of Russian and Ukrainian meats, and the kachipuri bread is hand made by an old man with the only oven of its kind outside of Georgia. So there you have it, a nod, apparently, to yesteryear baking., , ,Other offerings include handmade Siberian dumplings, spicy red wine shish kebabs and a pork belly sandwich with Gorgonzola and white grapes. I had the scotch eggs with paddlefish caviar, because I’m a big posho and that’s what I do: I eat caviar. It was awesome. I sat in the late afternoon light sipping artisan cocktails and nibbling on caviar and I forgot for a moment that I am possibly the poorest person I know. Which brings me nicely to my favourite part of any bar review… the happy hour. According to their most recent ,, happy hour at Mazelle has been extended; from 11am till 8pm all drinks are $1 off. But if you’re keen for a real deal, chase a shot of Evan Williams with a Session Lager for six bucks.,The barstaff are lovely so don’t be shy. If you need a conversation starter, ask about the light fittings – Yury made them himself!, , , ",,"bars,Bushwick,food,Happening,Mazelle,new bars,photography,Yury Maze","

Music,"A few weeks ago, my music blogger friends approached me about hosting an electronic music showcase in my backyard on Troutman street. The show was proposed and put together by Brooklyn-based blog ,, LA-and-Chicago-based record label and music collective ,, and Eric from one of the featured bands, ,. My roommates and I liked the idea but hesitated at first considering the unpredictable nature of house shows, but that was before we saw how passionate these DIY bloggers were about the artists performing.,My first concern was noise, but then I remembered- We live in ,. The town that hosts rooftop shows on an almost-nightly basis, where you’ll hear the same reggaeton beat pounding from cars across the area for hours at a time, where music venues blossom in storage venues, where even the fried chicken store on the corner blasts mariachi. This neighborhood radiates music- with a latina culture built on music, a haven for indie artists, experimental musicians, and DIY party-throwers- why shouldn’t we host that energy for one night? Our contribution to the noise of the ‘hood for one early evening showcase was made up of tight, mellow, intricately understated electronic music was a drop in the bucket. Turns out not even our (strict) super complained about the music and our kid neighbors (who happen to be little girls) watched the show from their fire escape and giggled the whole time.,Despite rumors of rain and worries for a muddy yard, the show went without a hitch. Our backyard is a huge space and we do our best using it for parties and bbqs, but it has challenged us at times with mud, neighborhood cats, crazy-looking bulbous weeds, and failed attempts at gardening. When I re-entered my backyard, and it was a completely different place- projections sprawled across a sheet, music equipment crowded our dining table, a huge tv flashing colorful graphics, candles kindling the good vibes. The fantastic, kaleidoscopic live projections came on behalf of ,, who was in from Chicago for the event. The assortment of musicians and otherwise creatives filled the space ate hot dogs and met eachother, joining in a random backyard at 8 pm on a thursday night to see live music by word of online blogging.,The show started with a set from ,, an electronic artist from Ann Arbor who often graces the city with his mystically charismatic style. Playful and pulsing, vocals chorally bouncing from speaker to speaker, his songs seem to emit a rainbow of sound. His set transitioned into that of ,, a Brooklyn glitchy-hop musician who remixes vocals to looping, wordless patterns, and creates houses of mathy beats to rest melodies atop.  A type of abstract, feeling-evocative sound/dance music, it was lovely.,(or, ,, when joined by others), who has been haunting NYC with his drippy synth silk for a while now, took the yard next. Featuring Eric, who does petal magic and croones in his lo-fi way and Nadia Hulett (who we previously ,), joining him to food the songs with soaring vocals, shaking up the sleepiness that lives in their chillwavey beats. Fantastic.,Lastly, ,, strange name but incredible music from a one-man-band. A truly beautiful sound, with a archaic voice that sounds like it belongs in 90s alternative rock, accompanied by faithful full-bodied guitar and vocal melodies on a bed of electronic flourishes. Strangely otherwordly and superbly nostalgic, perfect way to end the showcase.,An incredible event with sweet music and a great turnout- the vision of Dave of,, Elouise and Tyler of , and Eric of ,executed beautifully in my own backyard- a space I’d never imagined would suit a music showcase so well.  But, hosting such a successful and awe-inspiring event was an eye-opener. This is the land of in-house galleries and apartments that double as music venues. If you want to get involved with Bushwick’s creative scene it’s easy to find events happening every night, it’s fun to find others to collaborate with. If someone wants to responsibly borrow your backyard/rooftop/front stoop for a night to fullfil their creative vision, say ,!

Arts and Culture,"The only way to make it through this weekend was with a flask and a water bottle. It began long before it officially began, but debauchery is not the point so let’s start at ,.,It was a muggy Friday evening and two bands whom I really enjoy were playing along with another that a friend suggested. I showed up pretty late, enough time to catch the end of ,’ stoner-friendly set. Sweat beading on everyone while the lead guitarist lunged his way out of a sloppy guitar solo swamp of his own creation. The keyboardist was exchanging looks with everyone including the bouncy bass player as those notes became less and less streamlined and more out of tune. They concluded on two slash-and-burn guitar strokes. ,Whiskey, Yuengling and cigarettes passed the time while the Starlight Girls were setting up. Once I came in from smoking I saw something close to my heart. A ,. I’d played one for the entirety of my electric guitar playing years.,This is a hard/fun guitar to play live. The light “e” string breaks with such frequency that you have to either play without it or learn how to quickly change strings on stage. Tweaking even the volume nob on this guitar can turn it into an oboe. The strangest part of this guitar is that the lipstick pick-up close to the neck is too thin and the lower one is usable but boorish. So the pickup switch is best used in the middle position and then you have to fix all four knobs based on intuition. For all of that work and patience, the guitarist earns one of the most satisfying surf-guitar tones found in a modern guitar.,The Starlight Girls began by playing songs that I hadn’t heard by them. To be fair, I’ve listened to their song “,” more than anything else that they’ve produced. Coming to this show was a leap of faith based on their studio work. For musicianship’s sake, it’s worth noting that the drummer harmonizes with the keyboardist/flute player and maintains rhythm with the bass player. The songs are sharp. The singers have this vocal chemistry that I’m the perfect sucker for, and they’re perfect combo to pull someone like me into that trance.,Next up were ,. A band I’d seen once at the Opera House for a record release party. This band makes you feel alive. The singer used the dance floor as his stage with a Punk-Rock-Van-Morrison-swagger. So check them out sometime to ,.,I was rendered deaf for the rest of the night and most of the next day.,I awoke to have some coffee before leaving for Roberta’s Block Party extravaganza palooza. With that flask and water bottle in tow I set off. Before I had even gone one block I found a blocked street with Children’s Keytars hanging from the trees. Food was cooking and a church group was in front of their space singing into a microphone. Tambourines and maracas providing the backing music. I walked to them and began asking questions. , ‘song’? I wanted to know what was the name of the song where I could only make out the words “the spirit of god.”,A woman introduced herself as Pastor Melendez, “We’re a bi-lingual church. Who are you?”,“I’m just a writer.” I looked for the words to describe who I am, but there weren’t any in my mind, in my native tongue or Spanish. I suppose that I could have answered if asked in French with “Je suis perdu” a phrase gifted to me by a nurse, but only meaning that I am lost in my mind.,She told me that I was welcome to come back talking over the calls to “Open your heart to Jesus.”,I thanked her but did not tell her that Jesus makes me sad. Which is a hard thing to explain.,I pressed on to Moore Street. It was near one at this time and the line to get into the corridor of barricades was short. Crif Dogs gave out condoms which I took because I stupidly thought that they would look like hot dogs.,The block party was like logging into Facebook via dial up and waiting to press the “like” button on a few things. The firemen from Engine 237 were talkative and friendly while setting up a sprinkler cap. Bobby Buka M.D. offered to look at any warts I might have and no matter how many times they said that there was no more free pizza, a line kept forming outside the Tiki Bar. I’m thankful that I had that flask.,I walked into Ridgewood at some point because it’s more pleasant to smoke DMT there than in Bushwick. There were other blocks cordoned off with music spilling out of them.,While passing back into Bushwick the rain finally came and I ducked into Kave where a friendly piano player sold me a cup of hot coffee. At some point I found myself walking down Troutman Street at dusk and saw orange caution tape that led me into the backyard of , and the exhibition: You Are Here.,A certain type of person coming to Bushwick for the first time hopes to find this kind of place.,I walked into the maze and spoke to people through the twine walls. “Maps” came on and I pretended to be a keyboard player miming the guitar parts with red and blue and green and yellow colors instead of notes.

Fashion & Shopping," ,In Bushwick you are likely to see ,; you can easily buy some , or the most ,. Don’t let us even get started on , and ,. We have plenty! But on this lovely island of creativity called Bushwick, one important thing was missing…books! Until about last week, you had to take a train to Bedford to go to a bookstore. How crazy!,Luckily, the neighborhood full of passionate writers and readers alike just got its first bookstore. Furthermore, Molasses Books is in the very best Bushwick tradition, not just another boring bookstore., ,Molasses Books opened last week. I biked over on Friday, super curious and excited to chat with the owner Matthew Winn. “I used to sell books on the street,” said Matthew smiling and proudly leaning over the bar at his fresh new space. “At some point I realized I have so many books, I might as well open a bookstore.” Matthew found a perfects spot, a storefront on quiet Hart Street, right on the corner with busy Knickerbocker, and got to work. The result of his endeavor is a beautiful and cozy bookshop, with pristine white walls, wooden shelves full of books and a couple of tables and spots welcoming you to read. “This side is fiction, that side is non-fiction,” Matthew pointed first to the right and then to the left. “And we also have a poetry arch.” The selection of books has been curated by Matthew himself who is also looking forward to buy books from Bushwick locals, and create a really unique pool of great literature., ,However, the first thing you notice when you step into the space is a long bar. Matthew was brewing coffee and preparing ice tea for the weekend behind the bar. “I want this to be a place where you can come, read and have drink,” he said. For the time being, Matthew is only serving soft drinks but once the necessary license arrives he is looking to serve beer and wine, and maybe even whiskey. As Matthew explained he doesn’t want Molasses to just be a coffee shop; he understands that good reading might require a good drink., ,Matthew is looking forward to host readings, book clubs and other events.,Molasses Books (770 Hart St) is open daily from 8am to 8pm (except Mondays when they close at noon). Matthew is working at the store himself for the moment, so swing by, have a coffee and a read, and enjoy this lovely place.

We will party in the streets, drink lotsa beer, listen to good music and meet many great people. Who knows, maybe we will even party naked…,MANY cases of sleepless nights have been reported in Bushwick since we published , of new DIY music venue, Deliquency. Yes, we want to go as badly as you. This Saturday, Deliquency is opening their doors for the first time to the public, already at 3pm with a super-fun line up of bands (Grand Rapids, The Yellow Dogs, Dust Engineers, Lost Boy?, Murals, Roadside Graves, Bambara, Gunfight!, Osekre & The Lucky Bastards, Red Bedlam. Additionally, Brooklyn Brewery sponsored two open bar sessions – at 3-5pm and 9-11pm! The event is donation-based ($10 advance/ $12 door is a suggested donation).,Of course you can’t miss Roberta’s Block Party.

Arts and Culture,"My curiosity fueled by the intriguing name of this new gallery brought me last Friday to ,. Sunset Surf Club is a very new and a very different art space on Wilson Avenue.  Ran by conceptual artist and curator Julian A. Jimarez Howard, Sunset Surf Club seems to be placing the main emphasis on the concept and the idea behind the gallery as such., ,The gallery opened only three months ago and undertook to host bi-to-tri-monthly art shows and events. Their current show is already their fifth show. “I carry suitcases for rich people at The Standard Hotel, and I have never had as much money I have right now,” said Julian with a large smile on his face. “…and this is what I’ve always wanted to do,” he said about the existence of his brain child, Sunset Surf Club.,Sunset Surf Club is located on 253 Wilson Ave, a block past Myrtle Avenue in a storefront next to a barber shop and a tattoo studio. Despite the relaxed vibe surrounding the gallery, the space is absolutely pristine with beautiful finishes.  I feel like the unknown and the planned are existing in great symbiosis at Sunset Surf Club. The surprise element that comes with frequently rotating art shows supplemented with dumpling workshops doesn’t intervene with the well defined concept and the idea of the space as an incubator of new ideas and a challenger of traditional gallery values. Sunset Surf Club doesn’t need to appeal commercially. In fact Sunset Surf Club is blatantly rejecting the , of the gallery. “It’s a seasonal name,” explained Julian the name of the gallery. “We are changing ‘Sunset Surf Club’ into something else in October.”,The current show ,features charcoal drawings of Justin Hunt Sloane. The artist himself suggested the pieces are not hung on the walls, but placed horizontally on the floor. “I didn’t want them to be too serious,” Justin said. The only two pieces hanging on the walls are a , movie poster and pages from a book of prints released simultaneously with the exhibition. The drawings are tracing Justin’s recurring dream and are a “crossing between printmaking, abstraction and letterform, flatness and depth.” Placed between the drawings, several plans are connected to dripping hospital infusions., , , , ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

In the Hood," ,“Mayor of Bushwick!” said Robert, a resident of Palmetto Street for 30 years now. His friendly wife Lenette corrected him laughing ”Mayor of this block maybe.” Everybody in Bushwick knows Robert and he knows everybody. It was a sunny Sunday afternoon in Bushwick, and a merry company was resting on a stoop and chatting about life and a 12-day old snow white husky puppy. Robert is not only an unofficial mayor of Bushwick but also a big animal lover. Four husky puppies with blue eyes were just born in his railroad apartment and increased the number of his dogs to nine… “But the puppies are all spoken for,” said Robert proudly. , ,“In the summer we keep the dogs in the bedroom with the air-conditioner on,” explained Robert holding another husky puppy in his hand. , and I gladly accepted an invitation to visit Robet’s and Lenette’s apartment, and meet the rest his animals. Meryl and I were on a Bushwick street photo walk and we couldn’t hope for more interesting twist of circumstances. Robert’s apartment was full but clean. Interesting artefacts and books were holding their places on the shelves. “When you burn an incese, the smoke comes out of his throat,” said Lenette smiling when she noticed me looking curiously at a dragon sculpture.  Grandmother husky Julia was insisting on being petted while Lenette was dedicating her attention to the only dog of a different breed than Husky, a cute little one-eyed Maltese. “$3,000 we had to pay to save this little cutie,” said Robert regarding the missing eye., ,No doubt that Robert and his family love animals. In a big cage he keeps a baby falcon that he found on a street with injured wing after a bicycle accident. “I am taking care of him until his wing gets better,” said Robert. “He is friendly and that’s good,” Robert added smiling., ,The unexpected zoo tour ended with a quick visit to the turtles in the bathroom…, , ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

One of the area’s best restaurants, Ghia pulled out all the stops to bring a little Maryland to Brooklyn.,The restaurant offered two seatings, at 7:30 and 9:30, which near-completely sold out. Each attendee was preparted with specific instructions about how exactly to crack our Maryland blue crabs, a set of tools, a delicious butter-aioli dipping sauce, and classic crab bibs.,The $30-per-person bill allowed for 6 crabs each, but it really ended up as a mouthwatering all-you-can-eat affair. Not to mention unlimited sides of corn on the cob, watermelon, and potato wedges. There was an actual crab expert on site to explain to us clueless city folk how to eat seafood properly.,It was a truly excellent experience! I personally ate so many crabs I perfected the craft and now consider myself an expert.

Music," ,A big glowy yellow summer sun was going down behind the industrial wasteland of Meserole Street. An abundance of street art, big black limos (!!!), a line of people waiting in front of the door. It was Saturday evening, and arguably the coolest event in New York was happening right there in East Williamsburg Industrial Park.,The Well/The Wick has been rumored about since , when the first pieces of information leaked out. “Gigantic. Amazing. Enormous,” were the words of ,, our contributor who earned herself a super-secret preview of the venue a couple of months ago.,This past Saturday, we finally got a chance to look “inside” The Well and see for ourselves what has been cooking at the enormous warehouse at  Meserole St.,The first party at The Well took place outdoors in its large yard. Had the yard not been surrounded by piles of industrial material, we would have had amazing view of the endless industrial park surrounding us. We didn’t have a chance to see the actual space, but the outdoors show gave us sufficient flavor of what can be expected in the months to come. The Well is a high-end venue, and by high-end I mean high-end in the best possible sense. The creators of the venue took the Bushwick hipness, industrially romantic aesthetics and world class music, and mashed it together to arrive on the scene just in time.,The headliner of the night was Cam’ron, a rapper from Harlem assisted by a Flatbush Zombies, and Asaad & Reese. After a (,) security check nothing could prevent you from joining the super hip crowd and from enjoying the insane fun. People were in the perfect mood and by the time Cam’ron arrived on the scene they were also warmed up by the great DJ sets and acts of Plain Pat, Brooklyn Dawn and Osh Kosh among others.  Cam’ron’s performance was respectable and made everyone feel like a king of the day.,Looking at the , of the upcoming shows at The Well, we can expect some more big names on the verge of a giant break through. The tickets range from $20-35, the beer goes for $6. But coming to The Well is well worth it, and feels like taking yourself on a really awesome date…, , , , ,Check out the more photos of the fabulous crowd at The Well:, , , ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

Arts and Culture,"To save you from embarrassment, I’ll tell you right from the start that George Ferrandi is not only an amazing artist and the director of , she is also a woman. And when George was moving her studio from Williamsburg to Bushwick two years ago, she undertook to create something more than just another studio building. She undertook to create a community of artists of a similar mind set, and a loving place that nourishes one’s creativity.,One of the newest Bushwick artist studio buildings, serves also as a woodshop and a gallery space. Brooklyn Wayfarers is located on Dekalb Avenue, all the way past Broadway right past a church and across the street from a tire shop. When walking from studio to studio at Wayfarers, you can feel the touch of George Ferrandi’s curation who also teaches sculpture at RISD. Many of the resident artists are excellent sculptors who use natural materials like wood or clay (Craig Hein, David ‘Scout’ McQueen), but you can also find classically trained painters like Charlotte Evans from England who paints restrained landscapes., ,“We took our time,” said George regarding the operation of the gallery. They scraped, sanded, painted and drywalled for five months, so the first artists could move in in May, 2011. When the community of people was almost complete, they started to organize art shows. The idea is that every artist in a private studio is entitled to a solo show after a year in the building, or they can curate a show. But generally, George is open to ideas and basically anything can happen. “We just had a panel about kinetic sculpture, and a dance party before,” said George., , ,Wayfarers is a good place, surrounded by a beautiful peaceful energy. The building feels more like a home to an artist collective rather than a set of separate studios., , , , , , , , ,How to get a studio in this Bushwick paradise? “You send us your portfolio, and if we’re interested in the work, we would like to meet you to see if we’re a good fit,” says George about the application process. There are two tiers of membership in the program; private studios are affordable and go for $325 on average. Shared studio space in the shop is about $125 and comes with a storage unit. Both levels of membership include unlimited access to the facilities (the kitchen/common area with wifi, woodshop, silk screen printing facility), and entitle you to participation in several annual group shows., , , , , , , , ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

In the Hood,"After last week’s distressing heat wave, you probably found yourself wondering , if this happens again, what are some cool ways to keep cool (right?!) that don’t involve laying naked on a wet towel for hours on end? You’re in luck. After some research that definitely did not involve laying naked on a wet towel for hours – these simple, yet effective methods blossomed to fruition…, , Don’t have a shower? Call a friend and use a friend’s shower. Don’t have a friend? Go to McCarren Park, avoid being face-punched, and don’t do a backflip! You’ll make friends in no time., This should probably be number one, as hoses are awesome. They fight fires, fill up kiddy pools, keep kids off the lawn, and are an intrinsic part of slip-n-slides & comical skits showing how weak someone is! Also, you can spray your friends in the face and drink out of ‘em!, Not only will you get an abrupt icy blast, you’ll be able to come to terms with the fact that those frozen vegetables that’ve been there for a year and a half probably aren’t going anywhere… “But maybe I’ll cook those this week…” No you won’t. Just take them out, wrap them in a paper towel and put them on your forehead… then take pictures of how awesome you look.,Sit at some sort of annoying angle on the floor and blow on said ice pack so that your breath deflects from the ice pack right onto your friends face. This is essentially how A/C’s work (knowledge!) and from what I understand, how Mr. Freeze works too. Do this lil’ quick tip at a party for a great way to break the ice… (pause for roaring laughter…… anndddd finish with kiss-fingers-throw-peace-sign…. perfect)., General stores work great for this because their walls are teeming with only-moderately-useful tools from the late 90s and what I assume to be one-of-a-kind authentic holograms of tigers. Definitely pick something up and tinker with it for a few minutes, comparing it to something else that bears no similarities, thus leading you to nod your head in approval and mouth the words “ohh ok” slowly, and with delicate concern., And throw them out the window. Because your mesh Umbros and Fila tennis shorts will be doing all the work for you this Summer. Champ., Which is definitely a real thing. Call all your friends and tell them to bring their A/Cs over to your place. They will, because hauling an A/C around isn’t difficult at all and you told them you were naked on a towel. When they get there, throw old frozen vegetables at them whilst blowing rapidly on ice-packs in their general direction. By the time they realize what the hell is going on, they’ll think you’re suffering from a heat stroke and promptly install the A/C. To keep the crazy going – keep saying “ICE TO MEET YOU” and laughing at your own ability to quote pop-culture 90s flicks. You’re welcome.",Copy editor / contributor at Thrillist.com.

Arts and Culture," , ,Last night Facebook was a just a little bit more exciting than usual. ,, a social media artist based in Bushwick, decided to delete his Facebook profile. He approached the protest against Facebook as a performance, and all of his 1,500+ friends enjoyed some crazy poking, all caps statuses and wall posting insanity.,About a week ago that Man Bartlett realized that the cup of Facebook crap is full, and he decided to leave. He created a ,, which resembled a good bye letter, and invited all his friends encouraging them to stay in touch using other means. The departure to the ‘other’ world was scheduled at midnight after his birthday on July 5. Man could have hardly pick a better date, because as is every Facebook user aware, birthdays are the craziest time of all when hundreds of people post wishes on your wall. Man Bartlett encouraged everyone to post on his wall excessively, and as the hour of his departure approached he was posting more and more statuses. Additionally, Man decided to poke all of his friends before the midnight, which became a source of overall commotion and turmoil. Some of my favorite statuses by Man in his last hour included: “ANY QUESTIONS?,” which really generated many questions; or “NOTIFICATIONS ARE PILING UP FASTER THAT I CAN POKE;” “IT’S REALLY WEIRD TO POKE GALLERY DEALERS.”,It’s hard to tell how many people were sitting behind their computers refreshing Man Bartlett’s profile around midnight waiting for it to disappear but  I am guessing quite a lot.,Here is a video from the last minutes of Man Bartlett on Facebook:, ,Right after Man Bartlett stopped exisiting as a Facebook user, I asked him a couple of questions relating to his last days.,According to Facebook, since 2006. Though I thought it was a bit earlier than that. I remember being salty for a while because I needed a .edu address and I was already out of school.

In the Hood," ,With regards to ,, it was among the first wave of galleries that opened in Bushwick. They focused on street art with a vengeance and featured among others ,, ,, and have a , that spans a block. It seems that the mural will run until sometime in 2012.,Now that there is a sign on the door advertising a commercial space for lease one would be safe in assuming that the gallery is defunct as a physical entity. At least for the moment, and at least in Bushwick.,This lead us at , that the ,. Pair that with, that the gallery is closed, it makes for a fairly solid lead. We reported as such, and saw a , in which it was stated that we were in the wrong about the state of the gallery. We reached out to Ali Ha stating that if she would like to correct our article, we’d be happy to update it. A few lambasting emails later and we learned that the gallery is continuing in some form, perhaps as an online gallery, or perhaps in a different area. However, we can’t confirm either of those details as Ali Ha no longer wishes to communicate with Bushwick Daily.,So let me lay down the metric by which Factory Fresh was included in the original article about closed galleries:,If you are a gallerist with a shuttered gallery as I am now (author was a gallery director at ,, a loft gallery that recently closed down due to loft law and other difficulties), no matter how temporary it may seem to the purveyors of said gallery, then you are a former gallerist. Furthermore, if you don’t have a gallery in the greater Bushwick area (for sake of argument, let’s go with the Bushwick Open Studios map), then you are a former Bushwick Gallerist.,Speaking as a former gallerist, I plan to curate shows, sell art work, and represent artists to the best of my ability. These things make me an independent curator, an art dealer, and some form of an artist agent, respectively.,The mob mentality on display in the series of emails that we received from Ali Ha suggests that she believes that it is possible to threaten writers and bloggers into not disseminating the writing on the wall.,To the new curators and gallerists in the neighborhood: There is no such thing as bad press and you do not dictate the terms by which the press depicts you. You can send corrections, which are always welcome. We too are artists and are slaves to the truth.,Regardless, you are responsible for your own actions. We were perfectly willing to correct any mistakes that we made in that article and any future articles. Bushwick, by and large, is a community that is perfectly willing to be supportive in most efforts and endeavors that each of us takes on.,So let’s play devil’s advocate here: What if I wrote to any of you reading this and told you what a fuck up you were? That you were responsible for my business folding?,What if I took the burden of responsibility off of my own shoulders and put that on yours?,Would you then want to be a part of my community? Would you want me to be a part of yours?,The main point of this article is to remind those with hubristic delusions of grandeur that you don’t tell me or any contributer at Bushwick Daily (or any other publication) what or how to write. Inspiration comes from the spirit. If you take issue with the tone of an article, let us know. If we got a fact wrong, let us know. If we need to know about a new development in a story, let us know.,But don’t ever think that we can be intimidated into towing your party’s line. We wish you the best in your future endeavors and hope that Factory Fresh reopens with the same vigor they had on Flushing Avenue.,One final note, if you do decide to tell your friends to say and write nasty things about us. Just remember that you heard it here first.,Good luck.",Sean Alday is a writer originally from the Florida Keys and now residing in Bushwick.

Each night was filled with entrepreneurs and creatives alike, each contributing in their own way throughout a variety of artistic outlets. Many got a chance to meet others who had similar goals and achievements.

Brooklyn is an open studios festival happening September 8-9. It’s strictly limited to studios where art is being made including craftwork and artisans.

I understand the skepticism since it hasn’t been tried before, but this is basically the breakdown:,They’ve developed an app so that visitors can “check in” when they visit a studio. Once someone has checked in at five studios, then the user can rank their favorites., So the idea is to generate a sense of several spaces before you start making your votes?, Yeah, and after the votes are counted the Brooklyn Museum curators will visit the top ranked studios and based on those studio visits they will select a to-be-determined number of artists to show their work in the Brooklyn Museum.,This is the first year that this project is being undertaken.

Arts and Culture,"As of lately, we have been experiencing an influx of new galleries, bars and restaurants in Bushwick.  This post however, traces back four exceptional galleries that closed down recently. We would like pay homage to the places that helped to shape and form the art scene in Bushwick, and highlight their greatest moments.,In the basement of Gates Avenue building, a duo of visionary artists and curators, , and Kevin Regan opened Famous Accountants in 2009. With the intention to create a place for artistic discourse, it was also the first outpost of the Bushwick art scene in Ridgewood. Today we can boldly state that Famous Accountants was nothing less then a legendary art space that influenced the esthetics followed by the neighborhood and the way artists work and think in Bushwick. The gallery also managed to bring in the America’s most influential art press, and to throw really awesome chill parties in their backyard.,Phenomenal group show ,closed on November 6, 2012, and we haven’t heard from Kevin and Ellen since. Currently, Ellen Letcher uses the Famous Accountants space as her expanded studio, and it remains unclear whether the duo will ever continue the operation of the gallery. It seems like there was no particular reason to close down besides that the duo grew tired of constant flow of shows and decided to focus more on their own work., Basically any opening at Famous Accountants, but mostly ,‘s solo painting show and ,‘s Koran installation., Collage artists, painters, conceptual and video artists with excellent taste.,***,A year and a half of the existence of 950 Hart gallery was marked by great art, community experience and the encounters with people just a little bit more edgy than the Bushwick average… 950 Hart gallery was created of two adjacent lofts and of group enthusiasm of the loft dwellers. Unfortunately, it was the , that became fatal for the gallery, and resulted into premature  end of 950 Hart. “When we received a bill for $4,000 from our landlord, we said this is it.

They will add a couple of new items on the menu, but generally they don’t plan on tempering with the genius loci of the place, Life Cafe website informs.,Life Cafe on Flushing Ave was the first of the new wave of restaurants and bars in Bushwick. Kathy Life who ran Life Cafe in East Village since the 1980s, opened the Bushwick branch in 2001 when Bushwick looked like “post-apocalyptic industrial wasteland, with nowhere for existing and incoming artists and loft dwellers to eat or drink.” Kathy Life says that in 2001, the same landlord who is now giving her good bye invited her to open a cafe/bar in his building. “He told me the incoming residents desperately needed a watering hole. He said having a café close to his buildings would attract the kind of tenants he wanted. ” It is true. Life Cafe certainly helped to shape the neighborhood by making it more attractive for the new artist colony.,Kathy Life who seven months ago lost also the lease on her East Village space writes: “It was the East Village story all over again and I saw it. Except profit wasn’t my motive. I saw it as another chance to do what I seem to be naturally compelled to do: create a sense of home and connect the neighborhood folks together, offer a safe haven with comforting food and good drink at reasonable prices.”,We have until the end of the week to enjoy the legendary walnut banana pancakes or chicken wings, and through great food pay a homage to one of the greatest spots in Bushwick….

Music,"You may have heard of a little something called , It’s only largest and the coolest  festival to be born in Brooklyn. In it’s fourth year- and my third year attending- I was again swept away by the way Northside encompasses the vibrancy of Williamsburg’s art, music, and intellectual scene in a very home-grown way. Featuring separate music, film, art and entrepreneurial segments, there’s something for everyone. The music segment has always dominated the festival and this year boasted a crazy variety of headliners, form , to , to ,- only in Brooklyn? Last weekend I took my press badge and raced from venue to venue, getting a true Northside festival experience. Now, the best of the music that I saw, with links to tons of free music!,[box]Friday: ,,,, and, at Music Hall of Williamsburg- Brooklyn Vegan Showcase[/box], ,, we definitely , from some time now. This Bushwick outfit embodies all things that make rock-and-roll catchy; at times full, loud, and soaring with a reverb guitar and concisely pounding drums, other times with minimal sound to let the beautifully jaded vocals steal your attention. They tell stories with their songs, and in a very convincing way. Check out their , where you can grab their EP for free!,Second came ,, alumnus of Brooklyn royalty girl bands , and ,, whom I’ve been wanting to see since her incredible record , hit the scene in February. For her impressive garage rock background, the sleek, electronic, cool-to-the-touch controlled nature of , seemed to come out of nowhere. The basic summary I can give of her 35-minute performance was that it was at times awesome, at times awkward, and always strange. This new persona Frankie has come to fame through- galactic lo-fi dream-pop space queen- is not entirely genuine or comfortable in a live setting. Stumbling to harmonize with her backing vocal track, her classically trained theater voice really did not sound all that similar to its album counterpart. Playing her guitar on only some songs, and when so only very minimally, I was disillusioned to what the intricate and astounding , guitar parts really meant to her. At times, she soared, giving a song her full attention- while singing a “Pair of Wings”, for example, her vocals reaching choral heights as if we were in a cathedral. Other times, I wondered who Frankie Rose is, and more importantly, where was the album’s true mastermind- the producer. Bonus points, though, Frankie Rose announced onstage that she’s moving to Bushwick, or as she called it “The new Williamsburg.” Psh, girl please!!, ,, Brooklyn’s own sentimental alternative rock stronghold, blew me away. With dual drummers carving out tribal rhythms, earnest lyrics, sweeping harmonies and subtle synths, they are extremely tight. Think ,…meets ,…with a more traditional, wholesome songwriting approach. Live, the music comes to live in a dynamic way that you can’t find on their hit album, ,. They’re a buzzband for sure, I highly recommend seeing them.,[box]Saturday: , at Brooklyn Bowl.[/box],This gorgeous atmospheric goth-pop band was a thrill to see live, for several reasons. A well-known fact about ,is that lead singer Aleksa Palladino came to fame as Jimmy Darmody’s troubled lesbian wife on ,. So, it’s safe to say a lot of us mafia fans were starstruck to see her pouring her heart out in a rare, guarded but emotional performance. Their music is excellent- a sort of haunted, roaring strain of alternative music that embodies loneliness but has pop touches twinkling beneath the surface. Awezome., ,Take a blender, mix in some shoegaze, layers of noise, some classic NYC spirit, and a beautiful Japanese girl, you’ve got ,. Though their music is mostly known for its dream poppy, quiet, subtle rock influences, they band is meant for dancing live.  Unexpectedly loud, sometimes even thrashy (!), and more rock than pop, they put on a good show. Perhaps there was less emphasis on the vocals because lead singer Yuki Chikudate admitted to having Bronchitis. Either way, the emphasis on generating an awesomely loud sound (mostly) instrumentally went over very well.,I was so happy to track down this newbie buzzband- they played a lot of shows throughout Northside. I caught , at one The Gutter, a mellow place to see them go all out in their quirky retro style. They are a female-fronted playful jazz-weird-psychedelic fusion band that has a bright future for themselves in the BK scene. A mixture of smooth textures, funky 70s-style melodies, random noises (and occasional flute!) and upbeat vocals make them an inspiring and unique group. Be sure to head over and download their LP- for free! Ah, awesome music was always meant to be free.,, you make girl power feel old and new all at the same time.  This proclaimed “garage goth” band takes all of the best guitar techniques from the 1960s and places them amongst ,-style vocals and ,-influenced drums. It sure as hell makes sense that , discovered them. From their long, black manes to black spiky pumps, these girls are styled like witches, and create a really impressive booming, shredding guitar-and-rhythm sound. They’ve (surprisingly) yet to secure a national following, but I say it’s only a matter of time before they become the faces and voices of some neo-goth designer or clothing line.,This garage punk band from Nashville, Tennessee is doing everything right. Fighting onstage, jumping into the crowd, threatening violence, and rocking the fuck out, not to mention sounding great. , fill the gap where noise garage rockers , and , and more folk-punk songwriters like , meet. These guys have a southern touch that makes their garage rock simply more accessible. Garagey-Americana guitar, punk rhythms, vocals that vary from beach boys-style harmonies (“Naked with You”) to straight-up rambunctious spitfire verses (“Want some Mo’”). They’re fun, and even after their 65ths straight day of touring, they still enthralled the crowd.,[box]Sunday: , and , at Warsaw.[/box],I trust any band that would be touring with Starfucker, and , was a breath of fresh air. Ok, yes, they sound a lot like ,. Lead singer Adam Gil has ,’s whiny drawl and the same emphasis on pronouncing words instead of letting them blend together. Yes, the rhythms are layered and tribal in the same atmospheric way. But there’s this freshness about the quartet’s sound that really makes their sound embody youth. Maybe it’s the mash of psychedelia, dance, freak-folk and straight pop that makes them so damn catchy. Maybe it’s the don’t-care attitude that allows them to layer their sprawling vocal tracks so coherently. Their rarely a harmony that it traditionally soothing; rather they rely on softly startling their viewers into paying attention. There’s nothing sleepy about this band. Download their LP for free ,!,As an age-old , fan, I suddenly felt out of place at Sunday’s show.  I haven’t been impressed with Starfucker’s last album and EP (since they dumbly attempted to change their name to ,) but remained loyal despite the growth away from lightheaded, melodic, smart electro-pop music to a less sincere psych-pop effort. The first thing that was so offsetting was that they have lost their ,-era, Ryan Biornstad, lead singer (??!!)- complete news to me, but of no concern to the 16+ crowd around me, who bopped and raved with little clue. The more overpowering concern was that the band played with little to no energy. The same songs that once radiated sounded lifeless with a different vocalist, who did little to make his voice heard above the guitars and synth (which actually did sound great.) The performance was simply lost on me, having experienced Starfucker at their peak, and a somewhat disappointing way to end Northside., ,Oh well, here are some hands!

At first the general idea was that to be a curator meant that one was like a movie director or producer. Which is to say that dictates would be given and followed accordingly.,According to Christina Vassallo, the moment when curation became distinct was during the discussions concerning the theme and the wording of the open call. The students that we spoke with were very insistent that Cearia Janicki had come up with the title “Juxtacombo” which gave them a nucleus to attach the democratically chosen theme.,The theme of the show commented on jarring inconsistencies found in early 21st century life. On the ground were raised platforms featuring patterns reminiscent of the Islamic golden age when modern algebra was developed and a world-history preserved, walking closer, you realize that these patterns are encased in a glass frame and made with sugar-coated cereal. Personally, I found the swings between a childhood spent watching Saturday-morning-cartoons eating cereal and the transition into adolescence in 2001 to be sublimely affecting and present in the work.,The Assemblyman and myself found ourselves talking about our grandmothers while standing over one piece. Definitely a symptom of the “potential for unintended interpretations.”, ,The students chose the works on display (at NURTUREart until June 29th) out of over one hundred submissions from both national and international artists. They installed the work and each reported a similar feeling of elation when calling it a “cool experience.” While curation is cool, it says something that these young adults were able to work together to put on a dense, mature, and yet still playful art show.,Or, as Molly O’Brien put it:,Every student will repeatedly hear during their school career about the “real world.” Nothing prepares you for that except jumping in feet first.

Arts and Culture,"Austin Thomas and I sat down before Bushwick Open Studios in her art gallery , to talk about loss and failure. Or so I had planned. I was losing the lease on my space and thought that her story of rebirth and regeneration would be exactly what what I needed to hear.,So we spoke and she interviewed me as much as I interviewed her. She reminded me that failure is one of the most important components to success, and that true community can overtake conformity., I never considered myself a gallerist at the time. What I was doing was an extension of my artwork. Pocket Utopia in Bushwick was run like a salon space, it was only open on Saturdays and Sundays, we had artist residencies, exhibitions, and talks. So I think that giving it the title of a gallery, may be giving me too much credit [laughs]., So what did you call what you were doing?, It was really a place to expand my own ideas on what running a social space meant. We didn’t really sell work either. The work we did show included things like Andrew Hurst doing a , drilling up through the floor from the basement. There were a lot of performances and an exploration of ideas more than anything else.,The current iteration of Pocket Utopia is also an exploration of ideas, but it’s a deepening of the understanding that started there., Where was your artwork developmentally, before Pocket Utopia?, I had been building a lot of social structures. Things like benches, tables, chairs, for people to sit on and communicate with each other. They were hard structures that I made primarily at a woodshop in Bushwick.,I thought that my work was going to move in the direction of furniture. So that’s one reason that I opened Pocket Utopia, to see if I could run a space as an artwork. Which was very different from the idea of running a gallery. Plus it was only open on Saturday and Sunday, I had to work five days a week.,Looking back, it was my vacation house [laughs]., What was it like running an social arts space in Bushwick at that time?, We didn’t know that we were in Bushwick. We laughed one day when someone came in and asked “How does it feel to be the first art gallery in Bushwick?” We laughed because we thought that we were in East Williamsburg.,I knew that it was an artist neighborhood. The relationships between artists grew stronger as Pocket Utopia carried on. Building an arts community was the main byproduct of running it, whether we were in Bushwick or on the border [laughs].,I had a blog and wrote about how artists approached showing their work. I definitely noticed that it was more about the work and not about who you knew. With that knowledge I always tried to keep the focus on the artwork. I learned a lot about what making art meant to me.,The whole experience of having a community of artists to talk to… I had never had that before.,I don’t know what your experience has been, if you moved to Bushwick with your community of artists. Maybe saying “I didn’t have a community.” sounds foreign to you. But I had lived in New York for thirteen years before opening Pocket Utopia, with a studio in Chelsea for ten years, and I never found that I had a group of artists to talk to about making art. And what it felt like, was having a community who had my back through the experience of failure. Sometimes as an artist – failure is the best thing that can happen to you. We can get confused at always being successful or being surrounded by success.,Pocket Utopia had a beginning, middle and end, I had always planned on doing it for two years. Other things were happening, I was advocating that other artists open their own spaces too. I had learned so much about my own practice through having done that, that it seemed like something worth sharing. I don’t know if that’s your experience…, When I moved here, I didn’t know what Bushwick was. I just wanted to live and write in Brooklyn for a while. I realized that there were a lot of artists in my building that I got along with. So we started our space out of their adjacent apartments., And it has the downstairs right?, Yes they are both duplex apartments., Right… That’s where I saw the work that I liked. It was during Jason’s latest Beat Nite., What were people telling you about your space. And were you aware of what people were writing about Pocket Utopia?, In what sense?, On Edward Winkleman’s blog in 2007 he , that your approach would be the new mould for art galleries. That is, artist-run and artist-friendly., That’s interesting… The funny thing is that that’s not far off the mark from what happened in Bushwick. I mean, here we are on the eve of Bushwick opening up, and there’s over 500 spaces advertised. That’s incredible.,I’m , a show in Sharon Butler’s studio for ,. It feels good to still be involved in the neighborhood. I can nourish it, it can nourish me.,It’s great that artists move there and think about community. And it seems to be the main reason artists cite for moving there. It’s great to find that ideas can manifest so quickly.,That quote from Winkleman is as , as it was then. There is a lot of opportunity to do things, show things, write about things. It seems like there is a nurturing community in which you can show what you do with a lot of freedom.,The dialogue is moving forward. That part never stopped. I started with a few goals in mind. One was to run it for two years, the other was to do it as artpiece. Afterwards, I wanted to run with the idea of Pocket Utopia without a space.,We’re artists, we add and subtract things., What was the transition like from closing your space and going out on that limb, of trying to carry the idea forward, to where you are now?, I never thought that I was going to reopen. Immediately after it closed people started asking me to do things. I worked a lot with Jason Andrew of , and he runs one of the most collaboration-minded organizations around.,We worked together to put on , in Rouses Point, one year after I closed the space. So that was 2010., How did you like being in Rouses Point after having been in the city for so long?, I think that it was good for everybody. It was ten days. A lot of people came and it seemed to have a strengthening effect on the community. I love how Bushwick is this ever changing landscape right in the middle of the city. But that ten days was good for all involved I think. Sorry you couldn’t make it., I am too in retrospect. But I had no idea about it at the time., How has it been for you running 950 Hart?, It’s been a lot of fun. Definitely the best two years of my life. But I also learned more doing this than I ever did at school., I feel the same way about Pocket Utopia. It’s been a great time in my life and it was worth several Masters Degrees based on what I learned. But the community that came out of it had the most lasting impact. The friendships, collaborations, the spaces that opened and have grown since then. Art should have a firm foot in community. We should support each other.,My wish would be for that collaborative community to continue. I think that it will, it’s been proven to work. On that note I look forward to collaborating with you in the future., ",Sean Alday is a writer originally from the Florida Keys and now residing in Bushwick.

Fashion & Shopping,"I locked my bike on one of those somewhat desolate, spacious street corners under the JMZ, at Broadway and Willoughby, to visit ,, a very new boutique run by the Yazmin Colon. Yazmin was wearing a pink top and blue cardigan, and her enthusiasm and positive nature were gleaming just as bright as the parrot pendent dangling from her necklace. This is her first boutique, and you could never tell by the looks of the room.,“The most expensive things I have in here are those chains, they’re $30 each. A friend of mine saw those, and said ‘I just bought those somewhere else for $50!’ I don’t want to make a huge profit. I just want to cover my costs and then a little bit. I feel like we’re at a point right now where we are in a recession and rent is really high, but we still need to look good!”,Jazzabelss is tastefully organized and speckled with adorable, affordable jewelry and clothing for women and men of any age. Yazmin is in the process of acquiring plus-size clothing too.,Yazmin told me all about her 12 year old son Johnny, and how his classmates come into the boutique sometimes to hang out.,“I want the young kids around here to be doing something productive with their time, to keep them off the streets. I’ll tell some of them that if they finish school with A’s and B’s they’ll get a package of jewelry for free as a gift. And this collection here, these are little lady bells, for the younger girls. Sometimes I see them wearing jewelry or clothes that they’re just too young for, like huge hoop earrings, and I don’t like it. I want them to feel grown up and mature like their older sisters, but still look like the cute, young girls that they are.”,Aside from selling all kinds of jewelry that are stylish and will  never go out of style, Yazmin told me about all of her huge plans to open up a storefront in Brooklyn, a shop in Florida for her sisters to run, the jewelry parties she already facilitates, events she wishes to hold like block parties, participation in flea markets, and donating jewelry and clothing to organizations benefiting women and under-privileged children.,“I want my boyfriend to get a permit, we want to shut the street down and have a block party. I’d love to do it one weekend from Broadway to Bushwick Ave., then the next weekend from Bushwick Ave. to Evergreen, then the next, Evergreen to Central. Just get everyone together so we can all meet each other and maybe help one another out.”,Community, not competition, seemed to be one of the most important things to Yazmin regarding her business. We spoke about how so many people in New York tend to compete with one another for profits and for reputability, but that’s not what Jazzabelss is about.,[box], ,[/box]","Artist, gallerist, and bike enthusiast.","boutique,broadway,Bushwick Business,clothing,fashion,Happening,jazzabelss,Jen Hitchings,style","

She invited a dozen artists she has never met in person, but she has been in vivid contact through social media and art blogs. Many of them came from over seas, just to meet energetic Julie Torres and the rest of the group of abstract painters. They flew in their work, but they also participated in a collaborative drawing night with the Bushwick artist held at Hyperallergic HQ. The show titled , at a pop up location at Starr and Wycoff, The Coin Locker featured all of these works, and certainly belonged to the most interesting shows during BOS2012.

Arts and Culture," ,
-Michael Kronenberg,The thing that struck me as I wandered from place to place during Bushwick Open Studios was the field day Freudian psychologists would have with the percolating ego in every direction. Some obvious, some subtle, some well-intentioned, some well-executed and some none of the above.,Let’s start with the low hanging fruit as many of us are still holding on to our printed maps. It was large, as Jason Andrew pointed out it was almost the size of the New York Times. There were over 500 studios and galleries this weekend.,“The size is warranted.”,That was my first thought. Until I looked inside.,Something had gone awry with the design. The first page made sense, even if it was a tad sloppy. My only critique would be to have limited the existing text to one page. Following that were two pages filled with what looked like a whole bunch of nothing, two full pages promoting “Seeking Spaces” and several pages of promotion.,Finally a map appears. This is what many will see first when they arrive off of the L train at the Morgan Stop and it’s telling them that four air-conditioned stops ago is where the weekend began. Except for many of them the weekend began at No Name. Which is to say 56 Bogart.,After you make your way into the building a , of art madness ensues. Everyone is talking about everything. There are four floors and a basement. You kind of want to take your clothes off. The galleries on the first floor stop you from going through with it. But you kind of want to all weekend. The older gallery directors are wiry and spry. You can feel them reflecting a lot of energy, they are usually artists themselves. The younger gallery directors are bursting with similar energy. The world has changed in a generative way and they are all on the forefront of defining a new American culture., is filming a Bollywood Soap Opera with several of Emtee’s alter egos. , is considering his printmaking business with you. Marco Antonini will talk you through ,’s maze of videos. , will draw you to C.C.C.P. by both of you haven taken a chance. , will explain that life is fairly simple to complicate.,Once you’ve talked to a few people and get a sense of where to go, you may have spent two to three hours in 56 Bogart. So you might wander down to 117 Grattan where Austin Thomas had , a show in Sharon Butler’s new studio. Good pieces by Larry Greenberg were found here. I spoke with a friend for a few moments and then wandered around the room, three drawings of incense smoke stood out for the artist’s choice of color. , studio was Jae Song showing dual projections of a conversation between reflections. A building with open spaces on each floor, this will become de rigueur for your explorations.,Next stop seems to be Brooklyn Fireproof. Off the top of my head , , and , were hosting people. The bar was ready for happy hour and the chefs were preparing to enter their zone.,The serendipity of curiosity worked well this weekend. If you’ve stepped into the unexpected places on your route then you’re starting to get a sense of how many artists are in this neighborhood. If you think about how much energy is going in to every single thing to make this happen, the map fades away and you are on your way.,You arrive at , on 566 Johnson. First of all there is the gallery itself. Deborah Brown made a huge leap in the past year. It felt like the world she painted became less romantic and more urgent. The landscapes matured in the right way and devolved in sublime manners. Looking at the card table makes you realize that her projects are all over.

Turn around , has taken pictures of the way a computer might see you. The studios around are fun and full of different kinds of approaches to art from ,’s wooden bones on canvas to ,’s tasteful resin on canvas works. This building is sunny and the name reflects what it feels like.,There’s the Onderdonk House up the road on Flushing. The , is in the expansive backyard. You can get a , of the skyline from the top of the hill and remember that you’re in New York City. There’s a home at the bottom of the hill built in 1709 where a band called , is the real live session band for an ensemble of performances that can include you.,Head to 1717 Troutman for a wild session of studio hopping. Glass portraits, video, music, and paintings to say the least. Don’t forget to swing into galleries , and ,. It was my first time in the building and I felt it. There was good energy touched with enough anarchy and bohemianism to keep the galleries from resting on their laurels. By the way, I’ve seen Rob de Oude’s , before, but I was blown away by the large pieces in his and Enrico Gomez’s shared studio. There was a wall , of the simultaneously-linear-and-swirling pieces.,From there I went to Wyckoff Avenue. If you’re hungry there are two good options: wait for a table at the Northeast Kingdom or wait at the tortilla factory and restaurant. Afterwards, it may be time for an iced coffee. Just to top off the great weather (including the quick rain shower on Sunday) stop by the , where , and , were set up on the sidewalk doling out coffee and water. If you go inside have a Grasshopper.,There is a studio belonging to an interesting artist named ,. His painted canvases hung like shawls without a mannequin. This place reminded me of why it’s good to talk to the artist. He made these pieces to be worn, there was a look book, and there were canvases stitched into abstract figures of what it would look like to wear them.,Down to , for original collages of Pass Kontrol posters by Oliver Ralli. Two that stuck out were a , imagined conversation and a “Cut a hit record with Pass Kontrol” flier from Bushwick Open Studios past.,If you were even , about Bushwick art before the weekend began, , show it was hard to maintain that irony.,When I wasn’t running around I was around the corner at my space , for our final gallery exhibition. We made a lot of new friends, sold some prints and wrote the showing artist’s names on the wall.,Down to Starr Street and stop at quite a few places along the way. The first stop was the huge warehouse with Julie Torres’s , show ALLTOGETHERNOW and another several rooms of art. I could not figure out who was behind each room but there was always something around the corner. Mind your eyes and loose clothing; sculptures are coming out of the wall. From there it was off to the building that houses the Bushwick Starr. A collective that showed work featuring , and sculptures made with tenacity out of milk cartons and canvas. I even spotted a former roommate in one of the photographs. I recognized him looking right at home naked in the midst of a throng of moving people.,I stopped at Olivia Swisher’s home. She stood at the , with the door wide open when I walked in. I was puzzled. She offered me a beer and a series of poems by Chiara Di Lello written on eggs and milk cartons and packages of butter. I read everything in her fridge.,On ,, that was a name game and many people fell for it hook, line and sinker. But let me say that I enjoyed visiting ,, ,, ,, and ,’s booth in that order. Norte Maar’s booth had a , that summed up everything that I felt: “I am having , a good summer.”,Up to Wilson, past , and ,. Two drinking spots with unique flavors that both appeal to me.

This made me reflective as one of his older, angular pieces hung in my gallery. He is cornering his style, this is a part of the artist’s hunt.,From there I went to the arena that spoke to me more than anything else this weekend. It began in ,. First of all, Chris Harding puts on some of the best new exhibitions in this city. This show was no exception. David Pappaceno’s sculptures were arranged to give you a center of gravity and the bases were excellently arranged. The wall was a mind warp of colorful patterns and frames enclosing drawings similar to the sculptures. And don’t miss the paintings in the next room. Influences that are maturing shine through the originality of the compositions., Don Pablo Pedro sat cross legged and conducted a court of Bacchus. His work is quite good. I hope that you didn’t miss the Dirty Little Cunt.,Next door I found myself in awe of Jim Herbert’s enormous paintings. I climbed to the second level for a different perspective. I can’t wait to see what he unveils for the next solo show. These pieces need light and their own company.,From there you’ll stroll up to Bush Gardens for a view of ,’s “Charting the Not” curated by Paul D’Agostino. Here you’ll run into Austin Thomas’s work and Gili Levy’s for the fourth or fifth time. Next door is Tim Kent’s studio. There was a piece entitled “,” made with charcoal and paper that I had been wanting to see for a long time. This studio did not disappoint. It’s hard to appreciate the masterful technique of his paintings of European Homes online. It’s instant gratification in person.,After all of that, I was a bit tired and went home to nurse a whiskey bottle and feel good about the world.,If the trend continues I’ll have to be fitter than Jason Andrew and his dog , to see everything next year.

Arts and Culture,"The video game heroes. The animated gif fairy tale couple. Very likely the coolest people of the fashion world right now. Visionaries and playful internet kids who won a Willy Wonka ticket to do whatever they like! And hell, they are awesome at it. ,.,Reed+Rader is Pamela Reed and Matthew Rader. With a background in photography, Reed and Rader derive their inspiration from technology, internet, video games and augumented reality. This artist couple have created their own unique visual language by combining photography and animation. It’s not a surprise that Reed+Rader’s “living photographs” or animated gifs have been met with an overwhelming response from the fashion and art world. Their clients include V Magazine, V Man, Dazed & Confused, Another Magazine, Muse, Pop, Vs., Tokion Factory, Vice, Motilo, Cut + Run, SSENSE, Cynthia Rowley, Ashleigh Verrier and Becks Green Box Project, among others…,These awesome folks live in Bed-Stuy with their four cats and can frequently be found on their amazing rooftop farm growing vegetables. You’ll have a great chance to meet them in person this Saturday at the opening of ,, a project of our artsy sister Internet-based ,. Matthew will be the one wearing a pizza outfit!,We asked Reed+Rader a couple of questions….,
In late 2007, early 2008 we decided to stop doing still images and explore this territory of moving images that we refer to as photo animations or, just simply, gifs. Instead of just dumping old ideas online, it made sense to us being computer-and-internet-obsessed to make the work take advantage of that emerging venue. We saw that many magazines weren’t taking advantage of the web and we wanted to help push them over the cliff and carve out a new market.,We use fashion as a way to dress characters in stories we create. We really love the more outgoing styles of clothing that take more risks as it really helps to tell more about these characters. We work very hand in hand with stylists on projects to make sure the story is being told as we imagine.,Definitely. When we do something outside of an editorial or commercial job, there’s a lot less rules and not as many hands in the cookie jar, so we take more risks and try new things. We feel like with the gallery work we can just do it because we want to,  no other reasons.,We always say this and it’s cliché but it’s like the same person with 4 hands and 2 brains. We’ve been working together and as a couple for close to 10 years and there’s probably only a handful of days we haven’t seen each other so we know each other pretty well. Working in a team as a couple allows you to talk ideas anytime, it’s not uncommon that we are in bed at 5AM talking about ideas because someone woke up with a thought and needs to share it. With that said, it’s also impossible to separate Pamela + Matthew from Reed + Rader so work never shuts off. If we have to divide tasks, Matthew is stronger at programming and technicals and Pamela is stronger at general art direction and production. But it really is a team effort and nothing is ever done before we both agree on it.,We love Friends With You. They’ve been a favorite for years and most recently we both worked on the Beck’s Green Box Project.  The Green Box was an exciting project to be involved with and we got to travel to Berlin to not only see our project live,  but we saw Friends With You as well. We also are astounded by Memo Akten’s mad scientist tech-wizardry and adore Rachel Maclean.,Animated gifs are old, but very new at the same time. They are such an easy way to share moving content so it makes sense to make images move. Online you can make clothing move, have sound, have interactivity. These are all things we hope that online magazines take advantage of as it’s the platform they are publishing on. Whatever the future holds, we’ll always look back on GIFs as one of the internet’s first true visual art forms.,We have a 500 square foot garden on the roof, some people refer to it as a farm. We spend many hours there and lots of hard work, but it’s the best time of the day to go up there and just escape from the city stress and unwind. It really does feel like another place when you’re up there, on your knees, planting corn seeds. We grow broccoli, tomatoes, peppers, corn, sugar snap peas, strawberries, onions, kale, spinach, green beans, carrots, watermelon, pumpkins, potatoes. We grow a lot! It’s lots of fun, we love it., ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily. She can easily be moved by reflection of the sky in a puddle.

In her thirties, she is pretty, charismatic, lively and has so much to say. “I was telling them about Bushwick in the ’70s and ’80s, after the fireward and during the crack epidemics… All these burned buildings became crack houses…That’s where we grew up.”,Vanessa Martir grew up in Bushwick under rather dramatic circumstances. “I had two moms,” Vanessa explains growing up with lesbian parents. “That was ’70s and ’80s, New York…The climate was just very homophobic.” Additionally, her mother was mentally ill. As a child Vanessa believed that she ought be quiet about her personal and family life, which had devastating consequences. At just six years old, Vanessa was molested by a close family friend. Feeling ashamed and guilty, she kept silent about this until the age of 29. “That man in the window molested me,” Vanessa says, pointing at an old man at Meryl Meisler’s photograph.,“This picture shows how many layers life has,” Meryl Meisler comments about the photograph she took back in the ’80s on Bushwick’s Palmetto Street. The photo is titled , and captures a group of children playing on the street, a couple of women talking and an old man leaning from the window. Meryl says that she thought this photograph was happy…,Vanessa Martir, today a published author has been working on a memoir about her childhood in Bushwick. When she was 13, she participated in a program for talented and gifted children, and left Bushwick for a boarding school in Massachusetts.,“Nobody,” Vanessa answered, when I asked who else from Bushwick she knew who participated in this kind of program. Later on, Vanessa graduated from Columbia University, and now she teaches creative writing at CUNY and other institutions.,Meryl Meisler used to work as an art teacher at a school in Bushwick. She used to carry an inexpensive plastic point and shoot pocket camera, and take hundreds of photos of street life on her way to and back from school. The photographs of Bushwick in the 1980s by Meryl Meisler are an invaluable material of life in what used to be one of the most dangerous parts of the city.,Bushwick after the New York Blackout in 1977 wasn’t exactly a safe or pretty place to raise children, but yet Meryl’s photographs from the time are playful, full of life and happiness.,In December 2011, Soho Photo Gallery invited Meryl Meisler to show her Bushwick photographs in a solo exhibition titled ,Bushwick Daily’s contributor Shannon Firth wrote an article and created an audio slideshow about the exhibition. Vanessa Martir read the article and recognized herself in one of the photographs. Working on a memoir and processing events of her childhood in Bushwick, she is certain that it wasn’t just an accident that brought her together with Meryl Meisler.,For their collaborative art show in Bushwick, Vanessa went through hundreds of Meryl’s photographs, selected the ones that will be on display at The Living Gallery and wrote narratives based on her childhood memories. “Despite everything, life was happening in Bushwick.

Arts and Culture,"It is very easy to forget about the biggest art orgy in Bushwick and all the insanity is brings, when lying on a beach on Memorial Day. But BOS 2012 did not forget about you…. Dear Bushwickians, I hope you didn’t get sunburned, because it is ON….,Only days divide us from Bushwick Open Studios, which officially starts on Friday! Arts in Bushwick website shows 542 registered locations, which is ,. However, there is no need to panic! Whether you are actively participating or just visiting, we understand that you want to have the most of the weekend. Here is 5 ways how to navigate through the large number of the locations:, ,Every BOS veteran knows that one of the most common ways of getting around during BOS, is to pick up a brochure/map that Arts in Bushwick have been producing for the event annually.   Lucia Rollow (BOS 2012 co-lead) writes in her email this morning that the maps are ready to be picked up in stacks at the following locations:,Lucia’s House: 385 Troutman St #301, if the buzzer doesn’t work call 917-693-5719,Bushwick Print Lab: 1717 Troutman #204,Parallel Art Space: 1717 Troutman #220,Spread Art: 104 Meserole St,Outpost Artist Resources: 16-65 Norman St,While last year, the map looked more like a glossy MoMA brochure, this year the map resembles a regular newspaper. We welcome this change because of the more ecological and economical paper, and also because it’s simply more Bushwick. The design is pretty and overall we like the pink color.  Flipping through “a newspaper” should bring easier orientation in the large number of events, but unfortunately it doesn’t. As pretty as the design is, the map is not very user friendly. The neighborhood is divided into six zones, which is a good idea, but the paper doesn’t contain a summary of the zones nor table of contents. Very randomly, there is a map of the entire BOS (without the zone division) on page 53 between chapter Zone 3 and 4.,Among rather funny highlights belongs the fact that 56 Bogart building, , is called “No Name” in the paper, because the creators of the brochure didn’t know that the building is commonly referred to as 56 Bogart. The brochure contains a number of underused pages, which are either blank or randomly say “Boswijk” or display BOS logo. We strongly believe that these pages should have been used as table of contents or maps serving better general orientation., , , , ,Arts in Bushwick have created a , to help us navigate through festival Bushwick. This is a great idea, and we highly recommend downloading it and rely on the app rather than on the printed map. Just a little heads up, in case you own what we like to refer to as to ,, the app won’t work. BOS app works only on iPhone 3GS and higher., ,A number of publications, including , will be assembling their guides and lists of events not to be missed. This is a great way of not missing really good stuff and of relying on professional opinion of your favorite blogs and other Bushwick art geeks., ,You can instantly know and/or share what’s going on in Bushwick if you follow hashtag , on Twitter. Participating art spaces and studios are tweeting short blurbs and images. We created a widget to filter the tweets containing hashtag #BOS2012 and placed it in our right side bar. Is something totally worth it? Tweet it to your peers!, ,It is nice to plan BOS really well, and to be on the schedule, but don’t over-plan things because you might miss on the serendipitous encounter and experiences that plain exploring brings… We promise that you will have great time in any case (maybe even the best time), if you just randomly visit houses, studio buildings and galleries by just following the BOS signs all around our pigeon town during the weekend., , , , ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

I arrived late and found myself in good company with the bartender and co-founder of , Liz Atzberger. She offered me a shot of a small batch bourbon: Corsair Triple Smoke. I carried my sipping whiskey and walked around the sun drenched backyard to get a feel from the guests on how the event went.,I could overhear people talking under floppy hats about the amuse-bouche, a Deviled Egg Trio paired with a Bloody Mary Infusion made from heirloom tomatoes. The other dish that had people abuzz was a surprise Honey-Ricotta Souffle that came out as the first tantalizing course.,Chef Michael Kogan, Sous Chef Lars Kremer, Sommelier John Avelluto, the Dumbwaiter Paul D’Agostino, and a committed group of volunteers and friends fielded many appreciative comments and compliments to the chef. A special appreciation is in order to the Dumbwaiter for holding an umbrella up against the sun.,Upon sampling the second and third courses I could identify with the excited tongues and full bellies. A slow cooked egg en cocotte and flavorful hangar steak stood out above the rest. As though the artisan whiskey wasn’t enough to sate my appetite, it blended perfectly with the hangar steak that must have been carefully marinated to achieve its tenderness., ,As the sun set I sat with Liz, Lars, Chef Mike, and John to ask about the event and how it began., , We had a few dinner events here before officially opening the gallery. As a way of solidifying our dinner aesthetic, if you will., , Food is something I’ve always wanted to have here. I usually make a specialty snack for the openings. Liz makes a signature drink for the shows., , I’ve been in food service for most of my life. I worked with my father in Little Italy bussing tables for extra money when I was a kid. After a while, he opened two restaurants and I worked with him to pay for college. Now I own a wine bar [,] and Chef Mike [they met as undergrads at Brooklyn College] is our consulting chef there. Lars and I were introduced to each other by Paul D’Agostino due to our mutual participation in the visual arts and food culture and so we all worked together for a few months to put this on., , This seems like a large production, how did you go about it?, , The planning for this event was so far in advance that the production went as smoothly as possible. The event and menu was a way to break through social media interaction. We based the menu on how people reacted to five different questions and got a variety of answers.,From that initial feedback, Chef Mike and John created the menu and wine pairings., , As each course went out, I posted it on the event page on Facebook. They had no idea what they were getting until it came out. We were all able to react in real time., , People were checking the page throughout the meal. As well as posting their own pictures of the food as it came out., , They said it felt a little awkward at first, being on their phone at the table, but it really caught on and that was an enjoyable part of it too., , That was basically the point though. Getting the feedback in real time and, for John and myself, approaching it like an art project. People were asking me questions as it went on., , Did you get to answer the questions?, , Yes but not as often as I would have liked. I was more preoccupied with preparing the next dish. I had Lars backing me so I had a few moments to interact. It was fun., What were the reactions to the initial questions like?, , I was looking forward to the answers that would give me room to play around with the menu. As a chef, I wanted to make sure that everyone left happy., , From an artistic perspective, you do look forward to throwing some curveballs., , People got into it. I had an intense conversation with Larry Greenberg about this dinner, and then I met him here for the first time. That was what we were striving for, the online interactions becoming real interactions., , That and having great food and drinks. It feels like a success when everyone leaves with a full belly and a smile., , And roses., ,[box],[/box]",Sean Alday is a writer originally from the Florida Keys and now residing in Bushwick.

In the Hood," ,A pleasantly sized crowd – not too small, but not too big either – was chilling in front of ,, a dive bar on the corner of Broadway and Dodworth. It was after 10pm. “The concerts haven’t started yet,” someone said in the crowd.  After a frantic bike ride and an even more frantic hunt for a suitable pole to lock my blue Myata, it was great not to be late for once. Broadway on Saturday night underneath the subway tracks looks like a different planet. The emptiness of the usually busy street was replaced by silence, which was only occasionally interrupted by the laughter of a group of dressed-to-impress transvestites or the far away beat of salsa coming from someone’s basement. ,, my homie and , star, was the tallest and smoking like chimney.

Frank Rathbone, another member of this locally super-popular rock ’n’ roll band looked a bit sad too.  They were going to play only as a duo switching between the guitar and the drums. “We’re not ready to replace John yet,” Gillian said, and I swear it seemed like she was going through a break up. “The three of us, we had something special, a strong musical bond…”, ,That night Photon played many new songs I haven’t heard yet.

They contacted the organizers of the BAP and expressed their desire to collaborate in the production of their next neighborhood event, and specifically to help organize others in the neighborhood and foster greater community involvement.

In the Hood," ,Two paintings  sized 11″ x 14″ and priced at $12,000 were sold two weeks ago at , (a third similar one is on reserve). One of the many new galleries that have sprung up in the past year at the 56 Bogart building can be rightfully proud. While $12,000 price tag on a painting might not raise many eyebrows in Chelsea, they have shaken the common opinion that big collectors never come to Bushwick.,One of the greatest contemporary artists and collectors in America who wishes to remain anonymous saw the potential in Royce Weatherly’s paintings, and didn’t hesitate a second. “These works are special” says gallery director Peter Hopkins regarding Royce Weatherly’s paintings currently exhibited in a group show titled , through May 28th.,“Everything that we have worked for is “now”. It will either work, or it won’t work but it will happen now,” said Peter Hopkins referring to his predictions that the bigger collectors can and will come to Bushwick. During the panel discussions , held back in January, and more recently this past March at ,, both organized by his gallery, the panelists and the audience alike were mostly skeptical that this would ever happen.,“These sales have helped change Royce’s life, my gallery, and mybe even Bushwick. This one small thing, that moment, everything may have turned on it,” says Peter.,Royce Weatherly’s hand can be compared to Vermeer, and his mind to Matisse. After a 12-year painting hiatus, Royce produced a work that caught the very notable attention of major collectors. What makes Royce’s work so enticing is the arc of time in which he creates a work. Many young Bushwick residents will be middle aged and perhaps have moved on from the neighborhood by the time Royce’s work is “finished,” for a key element in many of his paintings, is age, both in the deliberate fashion his paintings take to produce, but also in the arc of their “completion.”,“In a way, Royce represents the kind of person who Bushwick should theoretically be here to represent,” said Hopkins after talking about this painting as if it were a precious artifact that has been buried for years. “He’s 54-years-old, he’s shown all around the world, but no one could wait for him. I could.”,The paintings that are sparking the most interest however, hang on another wall perpendicular to this piece. We see two paintings of walnuts, one is dark, and yellowing with the years, and the other is bright, painted in the exact same way only lit from an opposite direction. The paintings emphasize the negative space, shadows and light, proving what isn’t there is just as important as what is. The viewer will have to patiently wait for the bright one to also become beautifully dim.,A painting , of the type of lights you might see on a construction site, glowing in a dark space. The lights are painted with such precision that this work can easily be mistaken for a photograph. But like so many works, the mood in this painting is what makes it come to life. The overhead lights are actually the lights that hang in Royce’s basement in New Jersey, where he paints. This is his studio now after his break from painting. The hiatus came from simply the everyday progression of life as the culprit (moving to the suburbs, buying a home, supporting a family, etc.) The painting appears to be created at a time where hope may have been lost. The dark basement is hardly visible beyond the two lights, except for a small shining orb in the distance, just barely illuminating a sliver of a staircase, perhaps revealing a glimmer of hope, a way out., ,Perhaps the somber tone of this painting is what makes the next one in the series so inspiring. , is bright, and simple in its objects but complicated in almost every other way. On a white background filled to the brim with shadows and light, an empty coffee cup lays on its side. It’s beautiful circular geometry is balanced by its dark blue color, and drop of brown liquid leaking subtly at the back. Next to it lays the plastic packaging of a cigarette carton, painted with a delicacy and precision comparable to the way Botticelli painted veils on the Madonna. Both packages are empty, but there is nothing empty or somber about this painting at all. It’s almost joyful in that these two empty objects say something is coming, I’m back, I’m moving.,“I think I’m lucky. Its hard to back and out and come back into it again,” said the artist as he explained what may have sparked creating these paintings after such a long period of time. “Its kind of nerve wracking, you’re not sure if your ideas are any good… But hang onto your ideas and pay attention to what you know.”, ","On a mission to expose the NYC art scene for what it is - fun, inspiring and exciting!

This community-based exhibition is a project that allows artist to display their work without the limitations that are often a part of getting one’s work into a gallery.,Nyssa, the owner and founder of The Living Gallery clad in a faded tutu and war paint explained that having a gallery has always been a dream of hers. Once the Living Gallery was up and running she began to focus her attention on creating a space that was inclusive. , is indicative of the diverse community living in Bushwick. Nyssa’s idea was to have a show that represents artists’ imaginations and concepts through different mediums. It actually works, running the risk of hanging art that could potentially have been less than gallery worthy didn’t factor in to the end result. The show provides over 25 local artists the ability to publicly display their sculptures, drawings, paintings or whatever you want to call it.,The Living Gallery in all its unconventional splendor has given the community a unique opportunity to promote the flow of ideas and unite people. Good natured Nyssa is on to something here. She loves Bushwick and its inhabitants and has willingly worked to combine the work of her fellow artists into one cohesive exhibit. Inspired by a show that she participated in at , earlier this year where artist could hang their work, Nyssa extended that idea by having anyone participate and continue to contribute to the show while it is on display.,Nyssa is planning on having , a mainstay for the gallery. Every few months there will be a new show with different artists and it will not be limited to studio art.

Paul Rome who wrote three stories loosely connected through ‘Calypso’ marginally appearing in each of them, also read two of the stories. , and ,are variations on Roman-Greek mythology, and both deal with love and oscillate between mild cynicism and realization of determinism of one’s fate.

The encounter with fatal love injects the Ancient Greek element into the story, which in my opinion brings Paul’s and Roarke’s reading segments together more than anything else.,Also interesting was how Roarke and Paul alternated on the stage reading parts of the stories. I found it really refreshing; my brain tends to focus better on visual information than on spoken word. This alternating also gave the viewer an opportunity to compare both interpretations. Endearingly humoring his own characters, Paul Rome played the role of the narrator. But Roarke was telling , story. Naturally the story was fictional, but Paul wrote it , Roarke, and Roarke was really believable. Listening to Roarke felt like a game with reality. I couldn’t help but wonder which portion of the story was still fiction, and which part was reality.,The music created by Roarke Menzies placed the viewer exactly where the authors wanted her to be: deeply immersed in the story., provided for a colorful adventure of a three-dimensional narrative, and all it took were two men on a stage to create the magic.

Arts and Culture,"Brooklyn is no stranger to television. One of the most hyped and talked about shows of this year, Lena Dunham’s ,, takes place in our beloved borough. However, the show has fallen under scrutiny for being a homogeneous and white representation of an extremely pluralistic area. In episode four, the characters spend time in Bushwick, a predominately Latino neighborhood, but you would never know that from the faces on screen.,Unfortunately, this is not an exception. Mass media has a serious problem when it comes to the depiction of Latinos. They are frequently nowhere to be found in the stories we enjoy in film and on television — and when they are, they’re often negative stereotypes. With that in mind, Yamin Segal and Julia Ahumada Grob took things into their own hands and created ,, a web series that focuses on Latino life in a rapidly changing Bushwick. “East WillyB tells the story of Puerto Rican sports bar owner Willy Jr. as he fights to keep his bar alive in the face of the gentrification of his neighborhood,” says co-creator Julia Ahumada Grob, who also acts in the series.,The , deals with important issues like gentrification, cultural identity, and small business ownership, but it does so with a lighthearted silliness. “It goes beyond being a Latino story, although it is predominately a Latino production. But I think people in other communities can relate to this series on so many other levels”, says Flaco Navaja, who stars in the series as Willy Jr. It was shot on location in Bushwick and South Williamsburg. The cast and crew did it all on their own, with the help of friends and family.,With most of the pilot season completed, the creators headed to LA to look for funding, but they were told they were too early. Not one to take no for an answer, they decided to release it online - in its entirety, on their own. “Latinos are a huge population that is consuming, interacting with, and I think are going to become leaders in, New Media. And we wanted to help be a part of that movement”, says Grob.,It was only natural then that they would take to ,, the crowdfunding darling, to help fund their first full season. They are looking to shoot and release 91 minutes of original content, which they plan to start releasing in September 2012. Their funding goal is $50,000, and they have already broken $15,000, but time is running out. They’re offering many great incentives, including a walk on role, so go check out their pitch video and help support a much-needed series born in Bushwick.,While you’re at it, check out our ,, where we highlight projects from the area we love., ",I can't wait for the future.,"Bushwick,East Willy B,Flaco Navaja,Happening,Julia Grob,latinos,web series","

In the Hood," , ,[quote]This is an incredible place soaked with history, sacred atmosphere and creativity…[/quote],Big crowds of people have been going to the church on the corner of Bushwick Ave and Jefferson St lately. The church has been particularly well attended on Friday and Saturday nights as opposed to Sunday mornings as you might expect…Yeah, you’re guessing correctly.  It’s not a sudden religious devotion of young Bushwickians that brings them there. The church and the schoolhouse have been rented by a mysterious guy named ,…,St. Mark’s Evangelical Lutheran Church and School at 626 Bushwick Avenue was built during 1885-1892. Designed by architect Theobald M. Engelhardt, it has served the Bushwick community for many years. The church building quickly became too small to educate all the children, and so a schoolhouse was set up at the southwest corner of Bushwick Avenue and Jefferson Street [Source: ,].,Moving forward to present day, the church has been vacant for several years now. With the help of  his two friends who wish to remain annonymous, Bobby Redd decided to make the idea of creating a unique art and cultural center in Bushwick a reality. The inaugural art show at Bobby Redd Projects took place in March this year. , curated by Dave Bates featured works of some of the most known Bushwick artists (Ben Godward, Don Pablo Pedro, William Powhida, etc.). The church’s altar was replaced by a stage where bands were rocking it, and in the back you could have have a Tecate. One of everyone’s favorite elements is a confession room/bar constructed by Bushwick artist Andrew Ohanesian. Having a confession room in a lutheran church doesn’t really make sense, but it’s a detail that can be overlooked.,Since their opening in March, Bobby Redd has hosted a wild , party, an eclectic theater/aerial performance ,, and the plans for the near and dear future also look pretty amazing.

Arts and Culture,"It’s been subject to whispering and rumours for a couple of weeks now. This year’s , will bring much news. A, for better orientation; , and art spaces than ever; , (!); and Bushwick’s first very own ,.,Bushwick’s artistic community has been growing every year, BOS being the most obvious evidence of this growth, and it seems that we have reached the point where it might be necessary to highlight.,is organized by Bushwick’s ultra successful artist of French origin, ,. Jules, unlike the majority of Bushwick artists who price their art in hundreds of dollars, has gained international recognition and regularly sells his artwork for hundreds of thousands dollars.  Bushwick Basel will be held in his studio, Starr Space. Instead of booths, the galleries will be divided by curtains. 11 galleries that are participating in this venture will present single person shows, in addition to their own shows in their art spaces.,The name of the art fair, ,refers to Art Basel in Switzerland,  a large-scale international art fair.,Jules de Balicourt was quoted by , saying that he hates art fairs, and that Bushwick Basel is sort of a parody, but also sort of not.,Having been a part of an art fair this year during Armory Week, I had mixed feelings about an art fair in Bushwick, famous for apartment art shows and DIY. Despite Jules de Balincourt clearly not organizing fancy Frieze, I had to ask, “Is it a good idea or not?”,I asked 4 of the 11 participating galleries about their reasons behind participation in , This is what they told us. What do you think?,“I love the idea of Bushwick Basel, and I commend Jules for organizing it, for harnessing our collective energy, and for putting his prestige behind this event. The participants include many of those who have pioneered the Bushwick art scene from the beginning.  They represent the DIY, grass-roots ethos of the place. The fair gives us a chance to showcase our activities in the ’curated’ context of Starr Street Space.  It is a total winner for everyone!,Storefront Bushwick will feature a solo show of the work of a fantastic Brooklyn-based artist, Adam Parker Smith whose work is both seductive and subversive.  He has shown recently at AIRPLANE, ‘Ghost Face’, Small Black Door, and in ‘This Side of Paradise’ at the Andrew Freedman House in the Bronx curated by No Longer Empty.,I was involved in the initial discussion re this art fair. Jules asked my advice re the wisdom of doing it, how it would be perceived, and who should be asked to participate.  Jules took many of my suggestions, including the decision to ask Momenta and NurtureArt to be part of the mix.,I am excited to be part of Bushwick Basel and think it will give artists in our community a new platform and a wider audience for their work.”,“Bushwick Open Studios has always been about the artist. Either the artist’s work, or the artist’s ideas. I think it’s great that Jules de Balincourt, as an artists, is tossing the idea of an ‘art fair’ into the mix. The Arts in Bushwick’s mentality has always been non-hierarchical, all-encompassing, and self-driven. Jules, is one of the most generous people in our neighborhood. I remember attending church socials, community yoga, experimental theater and many cool parties for Bushwick Open Studios at Starr Space, which he owns (now his studio). Jules, I think is curious, as we are all. Bushwick is still experimental. Or at least that’s how I still see it. Just because a bunch of ‘galleries’ load themselves into a building, are we all suddenly governed by some unwritten rules? What, are we in Chelsea now? Norte Maar is psyched to be a part of Jules’ fair and we can’t wait to hang in the ‘collector’s’ lounge. We will be showing the complete collages of Pass Kontrol’s Oliver Ralli.”,“I’m not sure if Bushwick Basel is so much of a prank. Other then it maybe coming across as just that, it is more so a great opportunity for people from the neighborhood and from outside the area to get a sampler of sorts of the kind of galleries that are out here. I think the participating galleries certainly don’t treat this as less than serious and will do their best to make this a great event with great art. As for what probably will make it being different from any “Fair” fair is that the emphasis will be more on a curated effort as opposed to a ‘for sale’ show. We in particular are very excited to participate since we had just moved into the neighborhood from Williamsburg and feel we’re being welcomed warmly. Plus it is, of course, exciting to show in the same space and being affiliated with such a great selection of participating galleries. We will be featuring works by Clinton King who is currently also showing at our gallery together with Gary Petersen, Lance Lankford, Suzanne Stroebe and Andrew Zarou in a show called Alter Minimal.”,“AIRPLANE is participating in Bushwick Basel because we were asked to, and it seemed like too interesting of an opportunity to turn down. At first I thought that the title sounded a bit facetious, but upon meeting Jules and seeing the space and the galleries that are  participating, we were sold. It’s an unusual opportunity to be able to collaborate with other spaces on a concept and create an atmosphere. I don’t view it as a prank or a parody, it’s more like a positive and interesting experiment. It’s going to be fun.

Music,"Last weekend, , music festival lit up the , in Fort Greene. The festival was a small-scale borough-centric event, featuring performances from musicians who’ve come to fame in New York.   The event was curated by ,, an epic rock band who hail from Cincinnati but have lived here in Brooklyn for some time. The festival- in its inaugural year- takes its name from the famous Walt Whitman poem which gushed: “I too lived—Brooklyn, of ample hills, was mine; I too walk’d the streets of Manhattan Island, and bathed in the waters around it.” There are a number of trendy curated festivals in the US and Europe, the most famous being ,- which boasts recent hosts like , and ,- but never have these festivals been based off of the overflowing talent of the land. Crossing Brooklyn Ferry, however, provided a rich sampling of music, cultivated from the diverse music scene of this sprawling, bordered landmass we call Brooklyn.,The 3-day festival, split between ,’s three in-building venues featured an incredible line-with several unique tiers of local festival performers. Headliners like , ,, ,and,whose music truly was born in NYC and Brooklyn, put a spotlight on local artists. This group of talent has made national waves with their innovative approach to the malleable genre that is Indie music- from new wave to experimental. Other artists, such as ,, and the , represent the transplant nature of many Brooklyn artists and residents. Though these bands didn’t begin in here in the city, they came to NYC to focus of music, find a solid fan base and have truly blossomed. A sweet layer Brooklyn buzzbands that have dominated the local music scene and are poised to blow up, like ,, ,, and ,, brightened the lineup for indie artists. Beyond this, a littering of diverse local talents, from the , to , finished off the festival in unique form.  The fest was rounded off by a few notably NOT-Brooklyn-based artists, like Georgia’s ,, filled out the rest of the line-up with an extra flourish of awesome.,I was lucky enough to attend the festival on Friday night, beyond excited to see the headliners and peek in on the film forum. In typical BAM fashion, the arts were well represented in the fest with 30 bands, songwriters, improvisers, composers, new music ensembles, and filmmakers taking part. In the tradition of the BAM, a classical streak influenced the music selections, and in the traditional of The National, an experimental approach dominated. This lead to an incredibly interesting sampling for Friday’s audience. I began the night in the Opera hall, observing the stylings of experimental rhythmic geniuses ,- who, though classically trained, have dabbled in indie/electronic genres, having collaborated with ,last year. They tend to favor strange sounds, and during this performance they used only metal tuning forks for an entire number. They are definite pioneers in their realm of music, and performed impressively.,Next I dropped in on ,, who, though featured on the small cinema stage, embodied much of CBF’s themes: classical influences, modern overtones, and a New York foundation. She played a haunting and beautiful violin melody while dueting with her computer, which hummed out minimal electronic sounds accompanied by undecipherable but beautiful computer-coated ,-like vocals., played next in the Opera House. A huge fan of (his previous band) ,, I was let down by his seemingly scattered and nonlinear performance. As a “math” rocker, he’s constantly balancing spaced beats in interesting ways. In this performance, his focus was there; it just didn’t connect with me. An interesting addition to the night, with a cool and interactive stage setup- it was dark, minimal and definitely weird-sounding. Let’s consider this the experimental base of the evening, although, not surprisingly, there were orchestral influences.,played shortly in the Opera House, and they blew the space away with their reverb-drenched, tenor-shimmering, “slowcore” rock songs. I can’t imagine their sound soaring as high anywhere else. It was as moving as a 45-minute set could be, and though their music is subtle, it’s intricate, and I could see why they’ve gained such infamy in New York- last year they even headlined a River Rocks free summer show., are an extremely talented band, an eclectic jangling of instruments and distorted yelpy vocals, playful in a way unlike so many of their contemporaries. Their name lends an idea to the funkiness that lies ahead in a listening experience- a buke is a six-string re-worked ukulele, and a gass (gase) is a guitar/bass hybrid. This band was actually , by the National, so it’s not surprising to see them as a headlining act. B&G pushes and pulls their instruments to almost unnatural limits, making them clank and squeal, which in turn informs lead singer’s “hiccupy” vocals, that are sometimes beautiful, but more often wacky, and unpredictably fitting.,Last and certainly the most incredible performance of the night came in the opera hall from ,. The dynamic front lady and electric-guitar goddess surprised me with her amount of manic energy and incredible stage presence. Tearing through most of her recently fantastic LP, ,, along with older, guitar-heavy songs and a (post) punk cover from the pop group, she lit up the stage for well over an hour and seriously captivated the crowd. Seriously, people were freaking out, including myself.,By the end of the night she had leaped into the small standing pit along the stage, and darted up the middle isle, rousing the seated-stunned audience to jump up for the rest of her set. I doubt that BAM’s generally very tame Opera house has ever seen as rock-hard a set; , is reinventing the woman’s place in rock music more than any other modern musician. She’s a wonderful performer, an intelligent songwriter, and she closed out Crossing Brooklyn Ferry in typical BK fashion- loud, sophisticated, and like nothing else.",strict rule breaker. photographer. music obsessee. brooklynite.,"All Tomorrow's Parties,atlas sound,BAM,Beirut,Brooklyn Youth Chorus to Janka Nabay and the Bubu GangAva Luna,Buke and Grass,Caveman,Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,Happening,My Brightest Diamond,Nadia Sirota,Skeletons,St. Vincent,The Antlers,the WalkmenSharon Van Etten,Twin Shadow,Tyondoi Braxton,Zs","

Arts and Culture,"The question is not whether , will be your favorite place. The question is whether you manage to find it or not!  Between the factories on Flushing Ave, this gentle, romantic white old farm house feels like a time travel to 17th century Netherlands. With a huge garden and historical interior it’s destined to be a center of culture and social gatherings. Its caretakers Adam and Chelsea have recently appeared in , and, in addition to the tours the house offers, have lately been active about involving Onderdonk Farm House in the lives Bushwick and Ridgewood community.,Two weeks ago, the House invited local vendors and buyers to spend a day of fresh air at a Flea Market.

You had to pay more attention to discover art in grass than art in galleries, but it felt eternally better to look at sculptures on grass than on white walls!,The show included works of Sarah Bednarek, Reade Bryan, Joy Curtis, Adam Distenfeld, Ryan Michael Ford, Wendy Klemperer, Jolynn Krystosek, MaryKate Maher, Jim Osman, Brent Owens, Kirk Stoller, Kai Vierstra, and Natalia Zubko., , , , , , , , , , , , , ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

In the Hood,"My wife and I have been wishing we could afford a new mattress for a while now… like everyone else I know.  A new mattress can be a pretty big investment, and to drop that much money at once usually perpetuates people putting up with the mattress they have instead.  Thankfully, it’s tax return time!,We planned to shop around and hoped to find a deal for under $500, being our box spring is fine and we’ll only need the mattress.  We started at A&B Bedding because it is right around the block on Central Ave.  There was an open door with a gentleman standing in it, the owner, Rony.  The gates were down, but upon walking up to the door, it was obvious what they specialize in here- making mattresses.  Period.  No nonsense, no showroom, no salesmen, which I find to be a relief!  When a business operates with no extra frills or embellishments solely for appearance, you know “the proof is in the pudding!”  And you could shop elsewhere, and have to pay the salesmen, the manager, the owner, the rent, the franchise, and all whom they pay, but you just can’t beat direct manufacturer-to-customer transactions, especially face-to-face.,The space is a mattress factory, containing equipment, products in progress, and finished mattresses with small rows between the piles to scoot through.  We were looking for a firm bed, and he had some suitable options already built and in stock.  He also took us outside next door to show us the components they use and where they build.  He offered an array of options that can be custom-built on site with different styles, pillow-tops, and more.  They’ve been in business for 12 years, and have a great knowledge and commitment to satisfied customers.  Since Rony had what we wanted in stock and finished, he tied it onto my van, and we were on our way with a brand new, queen-sized Jennifer mattress for $300!  He gave me a plastic bag to dispose of the old mattress in, along with his card and assured me he would take care of any problems we could have to ensure our satisfaction.,*Update: my neighbor just got mattress AND boxspring for $390!  Booya!","jojoSOUL is a DJ/drummer/music-maker/teacher from Long Island, NY, residing in Bushwick, Brooklyn.","bedding,Brooklyn,Bushwick,bushwickdaily,goodbiz,Happening,localbusiness,mattress","

In the Hood," ,Wearing thick framed glasses and an informal suit, director Josef Astor leaned against the bar surrounded by a handful of keen students on Thursday night.  Josef Astor had come to Bushwick’s , to attend the screening of his documentary , and to discuss its broader meaning in the context of Bushwick as the present home to New York’s bohemia.,Lost Bohemia traces back the history of the artist Studios above Carnegie Hall that were demolished and replaced, for the most part, with corporate offices of CitiBank. The documentary focuses on the colorful portrayal of the last residents of the Studios and their unsuccessful battle against Carnegie Hall Corporation.,Unbeknownst to most New Yorkers, the historical building of Carnegie Hall was specifically designed and built in 1891 (by architect William Burnet Tuthill and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, respectively) with spaces for artistic work. These purpose-driven spaces had very high ceilings, skylights and large windows for natural light. The Studios served as live/work space for a number of visual and performing artists who left an invaluable imprint in the cultural landscape of this city and of the world. Isadora Duncan used to live there and rehearse new dance works; Enrico Caruso made his first recording there; Judy Garland used to sing on the roof every night. Marilyn Monroe, Grace Kelly and Robert Redford took acting lessons here and Lucille Ball had voice coaching. James Dean studied scripts and Leonard Bernstein, music.,The documentary begins in the 1980s when Josef Astor moved into studio #845 as a young photographer. What Astor didn’t know was that he wasn’t just getting one hell of an amazing studio, he was going to be adopted by a community of artists living there as a family.,Throughout the film, we meet several members of a beautiful community of artists, but mainly Josef’s neighbor, celebrity photographer Editta Sherman, also known as the Duchess of Carnegie Hall. We also meet Bill Cunningham, famous street fashion photographer for the New York Times; Donald Shirley, a classical pianist; Star, an 80-year old ballerina who secretly does her stretches in the hallway…,The atmosphere of the serene creative refuge starts to change in the second part of the film. We learn of the eviction notices sent to some tenants, while others are given several months to leave. Almost like a , villain, Carnegie Hall Corporation forces the artists out, one after another. The artists fight back, they protest, they go to the court, they try to draw the media attention, but are ultimately forced to leave. Feminist poet Elizabeth Sargent is the last standing tenant, and she talks to us throughout the documentary as a mysterious voice through a series of answering machine recordings.,As the film progresses, we are served images of what is built in the vacated premises – conference rooms, cubicles, fax machines.,According to unofficial information, over 80% of the Studios will serve as corporate offices for Citi Group. The “very needed” music school will comprise of less than 20% of the premises.,Among other interesting facts that the audience learns during the Q&A is that the Carnegie Hall building has a landmark status and that the building belongs to the City that leased it to Carnegie Hall Corporation., , ,While the story of demolished artist studios is heartbreaking, it has another more useful dimension.  It is a story of corporate machinery getting away with anything it wants while the urban policy creators and media silently nod along.,I believe that the contemporary Bushwick can either take a lesson from history or learn from its own mistakes. There is an ongoing discussion among the members of the art scene in Bushwick, formally started by ,, about what can be done in order to preserve this artist paradise without anyone being pushed out in the upcoming years. (Anyone includes long-term residents, as well as the artists).,While our discussions regularly include an artist tortured by self-loathing taking a stand and admitting the responsibility for gentrification, the realtors chuckle…,The artists are , responsible for gentrification. But before you silently start to cry in your studio, let’s see what a sociologist Sharon Zukin says in her “gentrification bible” ,Zukin describes ,. The property owners are looking to increase the value of the property in the neighborhood converting industrial buildings into artists lofts, and by recruiting artists to live and work there. The artist life style creates “hip” ambience which attracts small businesses – galleries, bars, restaurants. This new “hip” infrastructure attracts different classes of people from the city who are looking to buy a property for an increased value or who are ready to pay much higher rent.,I will conclude with a quote of Sharon Zukin from the series of interviews for the website , where she explained the necessary steps in order to create a sustainable environment for both long-term residents, as well as artists to live without a fear of being priced out.,[box]“The first step is to be aware of the cultural power that people have. The second step is to force local governments to make policies and to make laws to protect people’s right to stay in the apartments or houses that they have. And this is true for the people whose mortgages are being foreclosed as it is of tenants whose apartment complexes have been bought by big investment company. There have to be actions by the state, zoning, laws… and encouragements for long-time residents. Don’t forget that the people who have been in the city for a couple of years are on the way of becoming the long-term residents….”[/box], ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

In the Hood,"Maggie and Brian Muldoons are cousins from Bushwick who have slightly different plans for the summer than the rest of us… While we will most likely be eating tacos at Rockaway Beach or playing frisbee on Coney Island, these two will be teaching art and tutoring girls in the poorest part of Africa.,West Point in Liberia is a place with a sad recent history. The country was stuck  in a brutal civil war conflict for 14 years. As it usually happens, the ones who suffer the most are usually the most innocent – the children. Many of these local girls orphaned at early age and have fallen victim to child prostitution.,According to the Muldoons current UNESCO statistics report that an estimated 73%, of primary-aged children are out of school in post-conflict Liberia. Getting these girls the education they need will make a major difference in their lives. It is reported that girls in the developing world who receive seven or more years of education, marry four years later and have 2.2 fewer children.,Muldoons want to work as volunteer artists with a non-profit organization More Than Me, and want to help supplement the girls’ education with activities the school doesn’t offer. They want to teach art and undertake other artistic endeavors, which will strengthen problem-solving and critical-thinking skills, and will add to overall academic achievement and school success.,Muldoons have started a campaign to raise $7,000 for the trip. Opting for a,, they have nearly reached their goal.,To help Muldoons realize their dream to help Liberian girls, Bushwick cafe , is throwing them a benefit this Saturday at 9pm. Five Bushwick bands (Deathrow Tull, Brian and Mick of The Nuclears, Photon Dynamo and the Shiny Pieces, Cave Days, ADVAITA) have volunteered to play, and there will be free chips and salsa from the Brooklyn Salsa Co, sweets and hand made t-shirts for sale; a raffle and auction for great Bushwick stuff such as a $65 dollar bar tab at The Pine Box Rock Shop, Little Skips gift cards, custom paintings from Bushwick artists, a free haircut from Bushwick Salon owner Chelsey Pickthorn, headshots/photoshoots from Bushwick photographers Sarah Tamar and Ky Digregorio, and a whole bunch more!,100% of the proceeds will go to help the Muldoons to build a safe house for young girls in Liberia who are at risk for violence and sexual exploitation.,Guys, this is definitely a cause worth supporting not to mention all the goodies that the Muldoons have prepared in collaboration with all the Bushwick businesses. Stop by on Saturday at Little Skips and help these wonderful folks to improve life to a couple of children who were not as lucky as us…","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

In the Hood,"At 7:45 am I loaded up my cart with 200 copies of the first issue of the Brooklyn Occupant, 20 umbrellas, a dozen foam core signs with prints from ,, and headed out to , May Day Morning Commute. As I looked at the pile of supplies I gathered, I had a twinge of doubt as to whether there would be enough people at Maria Hernandez to distribute them to. The facebook event had climbed from 162 to 188 confirmed attendees during the night, but being a musician who uses facebook to invite people to gigs, I’d become understandably cynical as to the accuracy of RSVP counts in the digital world.,As I walked up the southwest pathway of the park towards the center circle, I could only see about a dozen people standing around in umbrellas and panchos and my heart started to sink a little bit. I knew that the numbers would climb a bit before we commenced our march, but the image in my head of only 15 people chanting and holding banners wasn’t going to be very inspiring or impressive. I shook off these pessimistic thoughts as I walked up to the circle and gave a big hollar and shouted “Happy May Day!” I figured if we’re going to be small, might as well be spirited.,Naturally, there was a disproportionate police presence standing around, but that’s pretty much the status quo for all occupy events. Moments after I started pulling out supplies from my cart, a community relations officer walked up beside me and asked “Who’s in charge here?”, which prompts me to laugh a little bit before I say “Everyone, but I can talk to you about the event if you have any questions.” The officer was very polite with me and after I told her what our route for the march was, she said “I know why you’re marching and I just wanna make sure you guys are safe,” and gave me a look that undeniably signaled her suppressed support for the cause.,As 9am approached and people continued to stream in at a steady pace. Even more encouraging was the amount of press that had showed up to cover the event. There was one reporter from ,, another covering the story for WNYC, and more that I didn’t even notice until well into the march. By the time we were ready to embark, over fifty people had amassed and all of my fears of a “mini-march” dissolved completely.,We marched from Knickerbocker to Flushing to Broadway, escorted by at least a dozen police vehicles on the street and bookended by officers. The goal of this event wasn’t to “block the streets” or “shutdown Bushwick”, but if it had been, we couldn’t have had a better ally than the NYPD. Their escort caravan pretty much stopped the traffic on Broadway from Flushing all the way to the Williamsburg Bridge. At first, this sort of disruption made some marchers (myself included) nervous about turning off morning commuters stuck in the traffic, but that fear turned out to be unfounded as car after car honked and threw out calls and waves of support. One of the organizers of the march, Kyle, didn’t miss a single opportunity to run up to each friendly driver and give them some literature on May Day.,As I walked, a reporter with CapitalNewYork.com , about the march and OWS in general. I told him that for me, OWS has become a civic obligation. Either I try to make this movement work, or sit back and watch the status quo destroy itself. The Democratic party’s behavior since the 2012 election has forced me to acknowledge the fact that the bi-partisan consensus has left me behind. If I want to see end the wars on drugs and terror, a stop to corporate hegemony over political discourse, or a full and open accounting of the crimes of Wall St and high-level government officials, there simply is no place for me in the two party system.,Once we arrived at Continental Plaza at 10am, members of Occupy Williamsburg were waiting to join us. A big cheer went around the park as we arrived everyone gathered around the statue of George Washington. Almost immediately, a member of the National Lawyers Guild mic-checked the crowd to inform all of us of our rights, how to deal with being arrested, and asked everyone to write their phone number on their arm.,The march over the bridge was pushed back a half hour to 11am, to allow for more people to join us. As we waited, everyone got to know everyone, more reporters from the local ABC and NBC affiliates conducted interviews, and a large group decided to march around the plaza until it was time to leave in the hope of bringing along some of the nearby locals. When it was finally time to head out, we had gathered somewhere between 200 and 300 people. The police announced to the crowd that we were to keep moving, not to go onto roadway (which isn’t even really possible to do on the bridge), and not to drop any banners. With that we set out onto the bridge, along with the mini-marching band of drums and even a tuba that had at some point joined up with us, and aside from three arrests of occupiers who masked up and were carrying shields, everything went perfectly smoothly.,All of us in the movement have different priorities and embrace different tactics, but we are united in our understanding of the fact that our government has rendered the average citizen’s opinion to be irrelevant. The 1% (or more accurately the 0.1%) have attained full-spectrum dominance of our political discourse through their control of major traditional media outlets and campaign contributions. We are working to subvert that dominance by reminding people of the power we have when we come together to say “ENOUGH”.,Some still lament the fact that OWS doesn’t have a one or two “demands”, but this is an extremely uninformed criticism. Every single person in this movement has a set of demands, which they’d all be more than happy to share with you (whether you ask them to or not), and it’s not hard at all to find several that nearly all of us share:,That’s just a handful of policy proposals that I suspect every single Occupier would love to see enacted, or at least wouldn’t be opposed to. Not one of those issues is a part of the Democratic or Republican party platforms, nor will they ever be without heavy and sustained pressure from the people. Yesterday was exactly what needed to happen, and it needs to happen again and again and again until we get the Change, we were sold on in 2008.","Brian , on computers and , on stage.","#ows,general strike,may day,Occupy Bushwick,occupy williamsburg","

Music," have , in the past, and are back at it again with their recent EP release party at Public Assembly. One half of the electronic duo hails from Bushwick and they’ve made waves throughout the borough for their intelligent sound, strong fan base, and always fun live shows. They are a local band that strikes the perfect balance in a sound as catchy as it is complex.,Last week they performed in a typically stellar , showcase with other New Yorkers , and Bushwick-ees ,. But Tiny Victories, known endearingly as Tiny Vix, stole the show, playing a loud, intricate, and interactive set that included many opportunities for fans and friends in the audience to collaborate with Tiny Victories’ Greg and Cason, who passed the mic around for random vocal samples. The duo then built elaborate compositions overtop these (sometimes hilarious) sound scraps, transforming them into beats for their various songs. Their sound is so dramatic and so lyrically personal it’s hard to see it translating into such a fun experience, but these guys have the best stage presence ever. The crowd almost lost it jumping hysterically to the arena-poppy yet terrific beats and best-night-of-your-life arena chanting in “Get Lost.”,Let’s not forget this isn’t Tiny Vix’s first time around the block, although , is their first official LP. They were picked on NPR as a , and their single, “Lost Weekend” was even ,.  Lost Weekend is laden with buzzing baselines, shimmering synths, helicopter-wing beats, and a matter-of-fact rhythmic choral line that gives you no chance but to get sucked into the song.

Is it Greg’s incredible voice (better than ever live) droning beautifully like an opera-quality, angelic-y Interpol? Or is it the intense smatterings of percussion?  You’ll just have to go figure out for yourself.

I see you have art hanging on the walls… Yes, we will be having rotating exhibitions.[/box],Soon after , [RIP] brought a less than stellar review of the place titling it ,.,Anyway, long story short: The Morgan experienced several drastic changes through its history. To name a few, let’s remember the surprising tranformation of the menu from a sort of a burger place to a Thai restaurant; or the change in vibe from an indie music venue to a kind of Manhattan company party venue. The force behind these changes was, according to Richard Guishard, the management he hired for the place to make the venue financially sustainable. Today we spoke with Richard on the phone about the reasons for closing The Morgan. “People felt alienated there. I was receiving too many complaints about the people who ran the place,” he said. We have to agree. The Morgan wasn’t really on the radar of too many Bushwick locals on a Friday night. Richard also told us that he plans to re-open the place in a couple of months but with the vision he originally had. He wants the place to be ran by local people from the neighborhood as opposed to the Bronx crowd. We couldn’t agree more with the decision! In words of Bushwick Nation…., ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily. She can easily be moved by reflection of the sky in a puddle.

In the Hood,"After getting off the Morgan stop a few weekends ago, art lovers were greeted by a giant ,, lounging on a sidewalk. Inside 56 Bogart, a lady was rolling around in ,, and “living sculptures” were posing in crazy outfits at the end of the hall. Partly due to the recent , as “a raw-edged art hub,” a certain level of edginess is expected to be seen in there. Some expect to be blown away by crazy avant-garde art or weird imagery, with which Bushwick artists rebel against the confines of gallery expectations and collectors in Chelsea. But sometimes you just see some damn good work, even if it may lean on more traditional concepts.,An example of this can be seen tonight at ,, where Bushwick-based artist , will be showing her recent works. There will be no robots or sleeping bags (I mean, you never know), but Michel’s work is a breath of fresh air within the scene. Her pieces deal with one of the most beautiful and classic forms of all time - the human figure. The paintings, often headless are vivid and full of stretching, twisting, and swaying muscles. Michel cites an obsession with the human body and Gray’s Anatomy that began when she was just four, so it is no wonder the viewer can feel a great connection to the figures in the work. Each torso seems to gently twist and pull away from the canvas, born from an ethereal mix of colors in the background and submerged in some kind of cosmic space. It’s almost as if Michel hasn’t created these figures as much as she has uncovered them. “They [the figures] are already there,” she explained, “I just expose them.”, ,What makes these figures different than, say, your favorite Michelangelo sketch of anatomy is their ability to feel organic. In my opinion, this is due to Michel’s painting technique.  Michel paints each body with her body, using only her hands as tools. “I’m physical, the body is physical and it’s all energy so why interrupt that with a brush?”,“I felt freer this time around,” said Michel of showing in Bushwick. “[Little Skips] is very different and that’s why I chose it. I’m already annoyed with the gallery air, it’s all that ‘bourgie art scene thing’ I was looking to get away from. And Linda [co-owner of Little Skips], well she’s the best energy so what could be better?” Between the energy of Michel’s paintings, and the energy found within Little Skips (we’re not just talking caffeine energy) the show will refresh any viewer.

In the Hood,"It’s 10:00am on the opening day of the show.,: “There’s something I had to do today…”, ,: “Throw a massive party?”,Rooms are never prepped. Artists forget installation day. Bands cancel hours before the opening. Your printer runs out of ink. FedEx delivers artwork but you’re not home to sign for it because you’re getting bagels with your friends around the corner, so it gets sent back to the office in Maspeth. You don’t know how to get to Maspeth because you don’t have a car. Your co-curator saves the potentially-empty gallery wall space by driving you to Maspeth 4 hours before the opening. And this is just a fraction of the obstacles that the independent curator has to hurdle over in order to put a few dozen pieces of artwork on some walls., , , ,[quote]Somehow, you make people tell you throughout the night that you should do this more often, while you think ‘THIS IS THE LAST TIME…’ but you know it won’t be.[/quote],This past Saturday, , opened at Brooklyn Fire Proof.

You have six artists in the show and six walls divided by columns. What do you do if one of them leaves the country and forgets to give you their work? While a show is up for a week, some work gets stolen or damaged and the venue has no security cameras – what do you tell the artist? You may say “installation will occur between 7-9pm” and end up dropping the hammer at 2am on a Friday night. You may hold on to work for 6 months after the show ends. There are a million things that can go wrong with the execution of a show, but at the end of it all, a considerable amount of people got a chance to look at work that they most likely wouldn’t have seen had you not spent all that time and caused all those self-inflicted headaches. You also most likely will get a chance to speak to other dedicated artists and curators and set up a studio visit in your euphoric and tipsy state during the opening. Not to mention it helps to have a bunch of supportive, creative, and skillful friends to put tacks in the wall, collect money at the door, fold your press booklets, snake audio cables through the walls, laugh at you for being so neurotic about measurements, and to get the crowd going insane during the bands performance.,If you are a dedicated curator, you make the show work. You make the artists happy to have their work hanging in a place other than their bedroom wall. Somehow, you make people tell you throughout the night that you should do this more often, while you think ‘THIS IS THE LAST TIME…’ but you know it won’t be.,All in all, if you love art and community enough to curate a show, go for it.

People,". That’s the premise , derived, not from mathematical computations, but from his geometrical paintings. Rob de Oude was born and raised in the Netherlands, but art school exchange in New York spurred a set of coincidences and he eventually settled in Bushwick, where he now lives with his wife and 4-year old twins. Rob works in Ridgewood, in 17-17 Troutman building, which is also a new home to the gallery he co-runs, ,.,Rob has been creating his strictly geometric paintings for years, over which he has come to very interesting and always more and more sophisticated conclusions. His paintings of pleasing color schemes based on the layers of intersecting straight lines are so hypnotic, you cannot forget them for the rest of your life. Rob enjoys not only the geometric perfection he reaches thanks to the structures of rulers he builds specifically for his paintings, but also the mythical sense of a simple, perfect straight line, which doesn’t have an end nor a beginning…,Rob’s artwork has been recently exhibited in many galleries; one show frantically following the other, which frequently suggests that the galleries finally noticed how extraordinary someone’s work is.  , was followed by ,,  ZigZag in Baltimore, , (twice!) and ,.,I had a hiatus as a painter a couple of years back. I stopped painting, because I was doing other stuff. Mostly I was making money. I set up a woodshop in my studio and I was making kitchen cabinets. Very precise kitchen cabinets, so there is an angle there. [He laughs.] Anyway, the recession came in 2008, and I didn’t have the use for my woodshop anymore, and little financial difficulties pushed me back to painting.  For me it was actually very good. Painting was something that I wanted go back to for a long time, but it was always this compromise between doing something to make money, which is inevitable in the city, and this another thing, which is what you want to do. It has really been a couple of years that I hadn’t painted, so I started with something really simple, which is what I really wanted to do. I made a straight line. It’s a little bit quirky and funny, actually. It is also partially based on an ancient Greek story I once read. It’s a story about Apelles and Protogenes, and how a hand of a painter can determine the level of quality and perfection. Protogenes was not in his studio when Apelles came for a visit, so Apelles made a straight line on his door. When Protogenes came back home, he saw that line and he knew that Apelles visited him. So actually there is a lot in a straight line…,[quote]Protogenes was not in his studio when Apelles came for a visit, so Apelles made a straight line on his door. When Protogenes came back home, he saw that line and he knew that Apelles visited him. So actually there is a lot in a straight line…[/quote],Yes, but there is this mechanical way to it that is sort of doubled, because it’s done in an old fashioned way with oil paint and a brush. It is a combination. The idea, especially in expressionism, is that the hand or gesture of a painter is determining his identity as an artist. This is also something you can also see in another way; you can take that identity out…There are opposites to it and it is a play. The other thing that I realized was that when I can make a perfect, straight line, I can also play around with it. I made these constructions to make a straight line, and I made a guide to it with numbers., ,Yes, here is one, a small one. I had to take apart the big one when I was moving my studio. I am building a new one for the square paintings. I use a lot of tools to make my paintings. I realized that you can play around the straight lines it in certain way, and create these optical elements that can just grab you. That’s one idea of it. I like to grab the attention of people, as a first layer; to make them stop and look. Hopefully then the other elements of a painting kick in and people will see them., , ,A line is something that has a lot of meaning to it. All the lines that I make across the panel, from one side to another, don’t have an end.  There is a sense of continuation within the line, and how long the continuation will be is left in the middle. It could be forever… Think of a laser for instance.  A laser that you shoot out in the space, or a beam of light… From a special stand it’s something that is continuous. That’s something I’d like to say through my paintings. If you look quickly at work (and people usually look quickly), there is a lot of stuff that you miss.  These lines are all coming together in this kind of accidental spots…, ,The patterns are completely random. That’s a funny thing. I work with many opposites, like the perfection of the line combined with the fact that I do it by hand. It seems very mechanical but actually the opposite is true. The decision-making within the painting is something that a lot of times I don’t know and many times I don’t have a clue about where I’m going. I have been painting lines for some time now, so I naturally already know that if I go this direction, this is what happens. Many of my paintings are number based, but I don’t write anything down, because I don’t want to feel like I’m painting the same painting.  My technique is very mechanical and repetitive in some ways, but the decision making is very random; the sense of color as well. A lot of times the color choices are based on what I’m seeing and how I’m responding to that. This illustrates it well too. [He points to a dice on his table.] I was going to make my choices so random that I would roll a dice and paint according to the numbers that come up.,[quote]Also I figured out that your eyes see a blur at the intersection of the lines, and that’s something you can play around with it. Repeated randomness creates patterns. [/quote], , ,First line is usually on the top. It is a layered process. In the finished paining there is usually 5 to 6 layers. Sometimes more, depending on how I like it. I have a couple of patterns that I do repeat, and I am creating sort of a library of patterns, and I vary them in many ways. A lot of times within a painting I make a decision I haven’t made before. Like now, this is the first time I am making a background that is so vibrant and is so strong that it pushes the background to the foreground.,Also I figured out that your eyes see a blur at the intersection of the lines, and that’s something you can play around with it.

Arts and Culture,"You can tell you’re in Ridgewood by the chill atmosphere that lingers in the local galleries and bars. Sort of on the periphery of Bushwick, Ridgewood is enjoying its off-radarness. On Friday night, our favorite Ridgewood gallery , opened their new show, ,, in a post-trippy festive fashion.,Matthew Mahler, who curated the show, built it around the hypothesis that everything - from fashion trends to socio-political statements made public on Twitter – echoes sentiments of the countercultural revolution of the ’60s and ’70s and is littered with reminders of the psychedelic. Ten artists in the show (Andrea Bergart, Thomas Burke, Lisa Candage, Myla Dal Besio, Rob de Oude, Adrian Jevicki, Matthew Mahler, Jenna Ransom, Adam Parker Smith and Aaron Williams) have been subconsciously incorporating the trippy reminders that have now became a part of pop culture. Seriously. How would art look nowadays if nobody had tried LSD and told us what the world looked like?, ,The art show proved the excellent taste of Small Black Door. The desire for more color, more variety and more innovation in arts has been apparent throughout the programming of Small Black Door., ,The opening was friendly, half BYOB/half Coors supplied. We merrily discussed the Ridgewoodian happenings. Matt Mahler, a co-owner of the gallery told us that Jonathan Terranova, his buddy and the other co-owner has just become father and, thus, very understandably missed the opening. Rob de Oude, an artist in the show and a co-owner of new Parallel Art Space, was mentioning the upcoming art walk in Ridgewood organized by the Queens Museum. It’s called “This is Ridgewood actually” and likely refers to the fact that parts of Ridgewood were called Bushwick in previous years. We all concluded that the neighborhood borders discussion is a waste of energy, and the beautiful creative spirit is common to both Bushwick and Ridgewood. Moreover, it doesn’t come from the specific geographic location but from the people who live in both Bushwick and Ridgewood…, ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

Carol buys them online in large quantities. She was trained as a painter, and the illuminated pieces all started as gestural drawings.

Arts and Culture,"When Robert Rauschenberg set out to create his famed collages and assemblage pieces comprised of found objects, he created sculptures of the stuff of his lifetime. They were a living time capsule of sorts, discarded evidence of life as someone once knew it in the ’40s and ’50s. Perhaps taking a cue from this, , takes a similar 3D snapshot of life at this time at his current show at ,. It’s easy to look back and reflect, and think ahead and dream, but capturing the moment, the feeling of nowness, is no easy feat.,Upon entering English Kills gallery, the viewer feels like a fly swirling around the junk yard of life (an actual fly was spotted upon arrival). Pop-out pieces are scattered around the gallery, hung on walls, broken glass, dirty metal and twisted wires where paintings and drawings usually hang - dark, dirty, and seemingly morose.,Cutouts of magazines and images of snakes and other seemingly discarded memories appear to be part of a sculptural scrapbook. The pieces evoke both a cheerful and somber tone. Some works seem to joyful contain images of weddings and happy moments, like in the piece titled , in which an actual magazine with this image is also filled with scraps and metal. Others seem haunting, a reminder of what our discarded things may say about us. A work titled ,, for example, appears to be a small broken old school tv, one that you might take with you to your college dorm or a campsite. A thick, spiral cord sprawls out the back, as if ripped from whatever socket once gave it life. The image on the screen is a faint whisper of a man’s face, the eyes and nose just barely visible as they peek through a foggy faded screen. After seeing the look in his eyes, one wonders if this box is the host to his life, perhaps the cord feeds him life, acting as a sort of spine or brain stem., ,It is hard not to look at Hurst’s works and make the connection to Rauschenberg, but in the context of today, it takes on a totally original meaning. It’s interesting to think of the idea of being “plugged into” a TV in the ’50s, and what it means to have a brain stem connected to media today. An image of a magazine or a pay phone has different meaning in today’s world of ephemeral media, of the disregard for physical objects as services and material moves onto the web., ,To behold the physical scrapbook style of Hurst’s pieces in the show is a refreshing experience. To look at an object and the way he juxtaposes materials of different subject matter gives objects normally deemed as shallow (phones, TVs, magazines) a whole new way of communicating with his audience. A favorite piece in the show is one you can’t see, but is perhaps the most important. A part of the show that makes each piece pop, makes each piece attention grabbing, makes each piece important: 2012, the current time and place and all that it encompasses., , , , ","On a mission to expose the NYC art scene for what it is - fun, inspiring and exciting!

Additionally, the audience gets to play a small part of the script for the camera, which will be used in the soap opera. They will have a bindi make up artists present and a lot of Indian jewelry and vintage clothing designed by Terese Bennette and Matthew.  Simultaneosly, an art exhibition of art created for the film by Federico Massa and Stefano Ortega will open.,You can probably easily imagine that we talked with Meenakshi Thirukode for hours about the project. She told us all about Bollywood, its obsession with light skin, melodrama, MIA’s music and why is the project important…,[quote] I’m also interested in addressing the broader perceptions within and outside the art world – like the idea of an “immigrant” or being a “woman of color” or being “brown.” I moved to the US when I was 23 and until that point I was never categorized under any of those terminologies. The burden of those signifiers is kind of thrown at you merely because it’s just easy…[/quote], ,Yes, my background is more specifically in the history of the art market, connoisseurship and art criticism. I took up the Masters program at Christie’s auction house.  I wanted to understand the nature of the beast, so to speak. At the time, India, along with China was considered the big emerging market. (You might notice how we are forever considered an emerging market.) It was all about the market. I’m glad that every single day during my masters program alongside theory, we were thrust into the “real” world too. And the real world not that pretty at all. In my curatorial work, my articles and essays, I have tried to understand everything – all those contradictions, expectations, perceptions, including specifically the very narrow lens through which South Asian art and artists are being contextualized or seen.,I’m interested in perception and how it lends to our understanding of what we think is real, what is the truth.  Also what role might the expectations – from yourself as well as from others including your peers, play. I think we work in an industry where the lines between personal and professional are so blurred that its hard to separate the two and those relationships, those networks for better or worse dictate how well you do or how your work is received or put out there or talked about…,This project is another dimension through which I’m exploring all that. There are so many stories there that are essential, that need to be told from how I experienced it  – as a woman, as an immigrant…,The idea really stemmed from conversations with Peter Hopkins. I found a real connection with him! We felt that telling this art world story through the narrative style of soap operas was perfect because it touchs all the emotional arcs of what life really is. And we wanted to push it some more…push it so you think you are watching this young South Asian woman struggle in a treacherous industry that is the art world…It’s that and it’s also more…The narratives break, meta narratives start to pop up, slippages occur…The characters you see aren’t just scripted but some of them are being played out in “real” life.  I exist in many realities in this project – online and in the physical world. Which one of those is the real story or the real person is for you to decide! Maybe all of them are real…Maybe the main narrative is based on real life experience or maybe not…Maybe Meenakshi is real and Em Tee isn’t…Maybe Em Tee is real and Meenakshi stopped existing somewhere along the line….Who knows!,One thing is certain.  This never ending thirst and consumption of images and everything being produced here is just taking these narratives and images that are out there in contemporary popular culture and regurgitating them – because that’s what the world wants and expects, and will take. So I’m giving it to them.,[quote]We felt that telling this art world story through the narrative style of soap operas was perfect because it touches all the emotional arcs of what life really is.[/quote], ,Bollywood hates being called Bollywood! Because they find that a “westernized” term derived from Hollywood. Semantic Wars! Anyways, I have to say that while it’s a Bollywood reference, most of the Western world equates to movies from India. However, there are close to 24 regional film industries.  Each state in India has its own language and its own cultural specificities – from rituals of birth, weddings, food to traditional clothing. Naturally, the films, the music, it all varies too. I’m using music and the script of a language from the part of India that I grew up in, Tamil, which is a south Indian language maybe you’ve sung unbeknownst to you, if you’re an MIA fan. The music we sourced for the teaser is all beats from Tamil folk and Tamil movie songs with a bit of MIA thrown in. MIA is a big star in the West but essentially she samples a lot of tamil folk. But how many people know what “KUTHU” music is? Tamil movie songs use a lot of it, and I grew up listening to a lot of that music along with songs from “Bollywood” which is essentially the Hindi movie industry – Hindi being India’s national language.  Oh and do you know the Tamil movie industry is called Kollywood – YIKES!,Spicy details reflect how screwed up perceptions and expectations are…Indian films love light skinned actresses despite majority of India being of a darker skin tone. We are so obsessed with light skin that Indian films cast American and European actresses for roles of South Asian women…We continue to teach generation after generation of young Indian women to idealize and desire that. Straight hair and size zero are the in thing now.,The career of an actress ends at 25 but male actors at the age of 60 can still play a hip college student. Yes it’s a misogynistic world. But once your career of a film actress ends at 25, there’s always the world of television soap operas!!!,Also Bollywood loves TWITTER! Every single person in the industry tweets. Indians love tweeting! Being the second largest populated country in the world, that’s a lot of tweets…So that’s why Lady Gaga famously tweeted “ Who cares for Hollywood; it’s all about Bollywood.”,[quote]Bollywood loves TWITTER! Every single person in the industry tweets.[/quote],Morocco loves Bollywood!!! When I was traveling there everyone would look at me and my family and ask “Indian?” We would nod yes, and their eyes would light up and then they would proceed to name every actor and actress and film they have seen. It happened all the time!,Bollywood is its own thing and TV serials or soap operas are their own thing. Usually those who don’t make it in Bollywood or whose prime acting years in movies are a thing of the past, find themselves producing or acting as leads in soap operas. I think Bollywood soap opera is a whole new genre thanks to ,We took all the drama and multiplied it twice. It’s going to be lethal! [She's laughing.],But I have to say that if you watched some of the Bollywood movies from the ’70s or even earlier, the kind of arcs in the story – the way the actors emote, it’s all very melodramatic and theatric. You might not see this melodrama in everything that comes out of Bollywood these days.,What’s typical in serials is there is always one central character. I have noticed it’s more women-centric; its almost always about daughters-in-law, mothers-in-law and about big joint families where generations of the family live together so there is more possibility for drama. There has to be an evil mother in law or sister in law or step mother, or sometimes all three. Someone is always plotting to do something evil, but good always prevails. Like all telenovelas, there are dramatic pauses, an over-emphasis just to make sure you get the point. You could stop watching a serial in 2008 and get back to watching the 1000, episode in 2010 and still not miss a thing. But as I was sifting through the millions of serials being produced these days in India, I came across this latest bunch of soap operas that blew my mind! One of them is literally adapted from the Twilight movies! It’s not overly tacky, actually it’s very slick. And yes all the actors and actresses look like they could be in Hollywood – young light skinned, westernized standards of beauty, wearing skinny jeans, texting incessantly about boys and vampires.,EM TEE! [She's laughing]. You have to admit that she’s the one creating any kind of interest or conversation around the subject, right? Who knows…You might be walking down Morgan one day, and a bunch of people might break out into a dance!,I think it’s appropriate to have something that is about this whole struggle and the love/hate relationship between all the different art world players, happen in a place like Bushwick. At this time a lot is going on here. Artists and even the immigrant population who have been living here longer than the artists can hopefully relate to the story. It’s all about how we adapt, and who can adapt to these cyclical changes, and about the self-awareness that we all have about making it or getting left behind…The Bogart Salon’s programming also addresses all these issues. Being a gallery space in Bushwick and showing the work in the context of the space only seems natural to further the conversation…,Essentially the story is about the journey of a South Asian immigrant woman through the art world and her quest to make it “big”. So we see what it is like for her to get to America, get an education, intern and work in auction houses and galleries and find her “voice”. We also see the relationships she builds – both professional and personal. It is about being a woman and balancing work and family – the role of wife, mother, daughter and what that is like when there are certain cultural expectations in the mix from family and society. Especially in an industry that’s not “typical”, stable and still more of a man’s world.,I’m also interested in addressing the broader perceptions within and outside the art world, like the idea of an “immigrant” or being a “woman of color” or being “brown”. I moved to the US when I was 23 and until that point I was never categorized under any of those terminologies. The burden of those signifiers is kind of thrown at you merely because it’s just easy, and that’s what you “see”.,, has a main narrative thread that will be told in the language of soap operas in India. The role of Isha is played by Em Tee, which is an alternative reality some part of me exists in.,The idea is to talk about all the politics in a bizzare, absurd way so you are left questioning the veracity of the whole story. Is this REALLY a true story? Did all that really happen? Is that how it works? And yet there would be parts that, hopefully, people can relate to from their own experiences. The main narrative also breaks into Meta Narratives. We see slippage of race and reality with fantasies and performances all tied in.,I’m not casting professional actors but those who work or have some kind of connection to the art world. If they happen to be actors, great! The deeper dynamics of their place in, and relationship to the art world, that’s important to me. I’m casting  friends, family, colleagues, former bosses maybe…For instance Seema and Sunil who play Isha’s dad and mom, are parents of an artist whose work I admire and is my dear friend, Swati Khurana. The moment where the actors step out of the scripted role and talk about who they are and why they felt they could work in this film is very important for the meta narratives.,Furthermore, we wanted to push the story telling beyond just one linear narrative. We will be filming parts of the soap opera in spring at the Salon. We will create/transfer the sets there, so that people can see the actual filming and become part of the narrative. Another part of the gallery will screen the episodes already filmed and edited. So you are a viewer and a participant. The end is left open so that many endings, and therefore many more stories, can be told., ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

Music,"‘s Mixtape- Drum Along!,This week’s mix contains African tracks, selected for their captivating groove and rhythm elements.  I drum along to these tracks to practice djembe, sing along, and dance around.  The key ingredient is the pulsing repetition that draws us to move or express, the patterns we hear that repeat and invite us to contribute our voices.,Communal drumming has always fascinated me, surely because I didn’t grow up in a place where it was a custom.  I began drumming in school as a child, but I can remember specifically when I first experienced the magic of a drum circle.  While in high school, I had a music teacher who brought in his djembe and began adding this element to our regular snare drum/concert percussion regimen.  He and I planned to jam a bit during a lunch period, so we got a large music room, shut the door, and turned off the lights.  We began tapping out rhythms and ideas, repeating each other, calling and responding, cueing different dynamics, and GOT LOST IN IT.  Somewhere in this session, everything aligned and became an action being driven by a different part of the mind, if you will.,While drumming and listening, many parts of the brain work simultaneously and stimulate feelings and associations that become the result of this orchestra of brainwork.  ”Grooving” describes this reaction by our minds, compelling us to drop certain activities in areas of the brain for a welcome use of the parts that can “harmonize”.  Once there is this rhythmic harmony of brain activity, there is a dissociation from inhibitions and anxiety.  This teacher and I were drumming and deeply in sync, but the bell rang after what felt like a few minutes, though it had been an entire 40 minute journey through a state of mind that is limited by the words we have to attempt to describe it.,This was one of the most important sessions I have had of any kind, and led me to study these elements further.  When musicians find this element while playing, it breathes fresh motivation into our efforts because it reminds us of the key ingredient that compelled our efforts initially.  This brainwork is familiar to all artists, performers, entertainers, thinkers, writers, etc., and exploring this harmony of thoughts, expressions, and emotions provides us with a common devotion and intention, making for a very catalytic mix of energy!,A drum circle is a concentrated study on this exact brain energy.  Positive vibes, friendly exchanges, community expression, and the effort of a whole group to attain this rhythmic harmony makes it a recipe for magic.,Hope to see you all there!  And if this Sunday doesn’t work for you, fear not!  We’ll be out there every Sunday at 1pm, weather permitting.,Maria Hernandez Park, Brooklyn, NY,ALL WELCOME!,Babatunde Olatunji- What’s Your Number, Mama?,Bola Johnson & His Easy Life Top Beats- Ezuku Buzo,Tinariwen- Tenere Taqqim Tossam,Tom Diakite- Fala,Babatunde Olatunji- Love Drum Talk,Fela Kuti- Gentleman,Tinariwen- Amassakoul ‘N’ Tenere,Babatunde Olatunji- Sare Tete Wa","jojoSOUL is a DJ/drummer/music-maker/teacher from Long Island, NY, residing in Bushwick, Brooklyn.","african,Brooklyn,Bushwick,Bushwick music,djembe,drumcircle,Featured,jojo's mixtape,music,New York","

One hopeful program is a summer band camp for young children.,When speaking about alternative education, a mention to Brooklyn Brainery is a must. Despite being located in Carroll Gardens, it is worth the commute from Bushwick. The Brainery is a community-driven hub of teachers and students who simply want to learn something new for the cost of a few Williamsburg iced-coffees.

Skermo, 60, was well into the fifth hour of her workday by 8:30 a.m.,“I threw my back out yesterday,” she said as she pushed a chair under one of the tables. “If I sit down, I won’t get back up.”,And this was just a Monday morning, she said with a smile.,Skermo said her diner’s been as busy now as it ever was, but she admitted that Tina’s Place hasn’t been immune to a slow-moving economy.,Her customers, however, agreed that her affordable menu makes it the only diner in Bushwick where warehouse workers and afterhours partygoers alike can get short stacks with bacon and coffee for less than $6 and on the table in less than eight minutes.,Tina’s Place sits at 1002 Flushing Ave. and across the street from the Boar’s Head factory. Skermo and her husband bought the diner 41 years ago. One of Skermo’s relatives first opened the diner in the 1930s. She kept the odd hours – from 3:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. – to better accommodate the neighboring warehouse’s operating hours.,Since she first opened, Boar’s Head opened up its own cafeteria, which she was afraid would pull business. At the same time, Williamsburg’s urban middle class started to settle around Tina’s Place in what used to be considered an industrial area.,But Skermo said that she welcomed the changes. Her regulars still visit her, and the new residents bring with them a night life that keeps her Saturday night shifts teeming with customers as they dry up from their last call after 4 a.m.,“It’s our busiest night,” Skermo said. “It’s always full now.”,Earlier in the day, truck driver Joe Nix sat at a table near the counter, and looked over a clipboard that held a stack of spreadsheets. He hadn’t been to Tina’s Place in more than two years and said he decided to stop by today before going back to the warehouse.,He had already finished his plate of eggs with bacon, and said he could count on Skermo’s food to be as dependable as her hospitality.,“It’s still as good as it was two years ago,” he said.,Meanwhile, Joe Martinez walked in and sat on a stool at the far end of the counter. A supervisor at Boar’s Head, Martinez worked at the warehouse for 12 years and used to visit Skermo regularly. He took a break from the job but recently came back. He said that he wasn’t surprised to see Skermo still at it.,“Thought you’d retire by now,” Martinez said.,“For 40 years I’ve been saying the same thing,” Skermo responded.,“Remember Pete?” he asked.,Martinez then told Skermo that his former coworker who used to visit Skermo had retired and moved to North Carolina.,“So many people have left,” she said.,Martinez said that Boar’s Head cafeteria wasn’t always open during his shift, which meant that he stopped by Tina’s Place about twice a day. It didn’t hurt, he said, that Skermo keeps the prices low.,“You can get a full breakfast here for under $3,” he said.,Three dollars at Tina’s can actually go pretty far. For less than the price of a small latte at Starbucks, customers before 11 a.m. can get either two eggs any style or pancakes, both with their choice of sausage, ham or bacon, toast or potatoes, and juice or coffee.,The beverage is extra after 11.,Isabelle Davis, a twentysomething in thick-rimmed glasses who moved into the neighborhood about a year ago, sat in the back of the diner with her friend. When she’s not working at her office manager job, she moonlights as a program director for an online radio station.,Even as Williamsburg’s brunch scene creeps toward Bushwick with gourmet Bloody Marys and fancy baked eggs, Davis said Tina’s Place was consistent and not ironic in any way. She appreciated it as one of the few places left in the neighborhood where everyone could feel welcome and at home.,“A lot of new places don’t cater to such a wide socioeconomic net,” Davis said as she finished her $2 egg and cheese on a roll. “You see all kinds of folks here. Tina’s is an every day sort of place.”, ",,"Bushwick,Happening,Shannon Firth,Tina's Diner","

Mind and Body," on Troutman Street has tranformed since you may or may not have visited pre-March-2012. At the time, the , had a undercooked DIY feel that was memorable and funky feeling, but overall felt kind of cold. The space certainly felt hip, but wasn’t the cozy nook it tried to be with half-hearted plants and decoration due to the cement walls and floor and dark interior with no natural light. But, oh, how the times have changed!,The Body Actualized center re-opened last Saturday with a trippy rager sampling everything Bushwick needs and wants on a regular basis, in a permanent space. The festivities featured , (wink, wink).  The space has also tranformed- beautiful wooden floors and a tiki-hut style entryway were hand built by volunteers, founders, and friends of the space. A storefront with huge windows now overlooks the street, and if you came between 8 and 10, you probably saw the intensely-painted man  chunky black-and-white swirls enveloping his flesh.,Brian Sweeney, one of the founders of the space, gave a short and sweet speech in the middle of the evening, encouraging everyone to let loose and “let down their egos”-  an invitation to really just let it all hang out and an opportunity to thoroughly connect with fellow partygoers. Most of this connecting happened on the dance floor that surrounds the center’s new performance elevated stage, illuminated by churning NXT LVL visuals.  Ample seating- wooden benches, leather couches, and floor cushions- provided space for the party’s prevalent people-watching scene (costumes, drag, facepaint, clip on ears and a sea of denim jackets.),The best part of The Body Actualized Center’s makeover is  a complete overhaul of the outdoor space, centered on a close-knit firepit and log-seating for about twenty people. There’s also a double decker roof overlooking the backyard on one end and Troutman street on the other. Oh, it was a beautiful feeling to peer down onto the bonfire, dangling my legs from the low-hanging roof, the softly-misting rain slowly sinking onto the wood around me. The music, the conversation, the firey aroma and the BYOB beer- Body Actualized Center provides the BEST vibes ever.,Now that the center has gained some recognition- the party was POPPIN’ and a New York Times reporter was present- their presence is sure to expand in Bushwick. Yoga classes begin on April 2nd and the space will continue to host (at least!) monthly parties and other events celebrating their wackiness.

Arts and Culture,"“Bushwick collage is not only popular, but increasingly amazing!” This was my conclusion recently made after numerous art-exploring adventures in Bushwick.  Collage being a combination of elements from different sources reflects the time we live in so accurately. Magazines, postcards, fliers… Stimuli coming at us from every direction, combined with artists’ own imaginary world reflect everyday subconscious battle with overload of impulses. While some artists work with physical elements and cut outs, others work with images compiled exclusively from the Internet, and create collages in Photoshop. I believe that this speaks loud about the spirit of the time, and the vanishing importance of print and physical objects in favor of the Internet…,Here is a selection of 10 extraordinary artists from the Bushwick area who work in collage listed in alphabetical order.,., ,.","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

Arts and Culture,"[quote]Personally, I’ve been in the luckiest situation, surrounded by amazing art, living with it every day. [/quote],At 18 Michael Kronenberg moved to New York to study naked people at Parsons School of Design. He lived through several art scene collapses including the 80’s East Village downfall and the mallification of SoHo. After a divorce he moved to Bushwick when it was still an cachet free post industrial wasteland, taking advice from the “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Gallery” which is to say “Don’t panic.” He has been a Bushwick resident for most of the past eight years, hiding in plain sight a block from the Dekalb stop at 950 Hart Street during this time.,Kronenberg’s art is a reflection of his personality, spirituality and energy.,“The Garden of Eve” a painting completed in 2011 serves as a symbolic guide to the personalities of over 25 people who have resided in his space as couch surfers or roommates. The artists, musicians and models who have come into his life at perpendicular angles have added their energetic contributions to numerous drawings and paintings that litter his studio. It speaks to his ability to put the people in his life in perspective and also let them know that he notices them. He has advised numerous artists at different points in their careers.,One goal he always hoped to meet, was to run an art gallery. The blooming of the Bushwick art scene, which has pumped air into the tires of the neighborhood, allowed him this chance.,In 2010 he and a group of artists at , joined other apartment galleries such as Norte Maar and Centotto. The hard working crew at 950 Hart have put on 21 shows in the past 14 months and have been invited to join , on March 10th, a Bushwick gallery walk put together by Jason Andrew.,It’s been a little over a year since he began the art experiment known as 950 Hart Gallery. With the help of Antoinette Johnson, Mikki Nylund and Sean Alday (disclaimer: this is a true story, I was there) he began a community art experience focused on the love of art.  This is an assessment of that year from a personal standpoint as well as a gentle reminder for anyone who cares about art: Don’t Panic.,[quote]In chaotic times we can take advantage of the general confusion to be completely free to do absolutely anything that we want to do. We battle daily to preserve the space, and try to enjoy the cumulative adrenaline rush that comes from fighting against fear and lack of resources. [/quote],Two trains of thought are running through my head at this point, fear of disaster and a quiet confidence that if we can hold our intentions we can accomplish virtually anything.,In chaotic times we can take advantage of the general confusion to be completely free to do absolutely anything that we want to do. We battle daily to preserve the space, and try to enjoy the cumulative adrenaline rush  that comes from fighting against fear and lack of resources.,I personally feel that my work is in transition of late. Running this space and managing egos and expectations has taken away from my art making time.,Artists hold a mirror up to the face of God so he can admire his reflection.,My family history belongs to storytellers, religious types and refugees.,I’m telling my stories when I draw. I’m painting my personal worlds when I paint. I’m a Buddhist, a lapsed Buddhist [laughs], and the influence of my meditation practice on my art practice is considerable. I look for things that can be hard to see if I don’t keep my mind’s eye open.,In practicing my drawing and painting I’ve finally come to a place where I’m not thinking when I work, my work exists and I exist.,I love German Expressionism and Tibetan Iconography.,Christian Schaad and Alice Neel understood that there’s an endless battle between inner life and what you actually see. I’m influenced by a large number of artists, from old masters to 20th Century cartoonists. I’m also inspired to work harder by people we show [in 950 Hart Gallery], I get a terrific charge when they get it right.,Chance encounters are also extremely powerful. Jim Herbert has been one of my personal heroes. I remember watching his videos, discovering his photo-books and his paintings. We went to the English Kills show last year, and talked with him about his work. That’s inspiring to me, he’s in his seventies and is painting like a master.,Well, I’ve been going to shows in the neighborhood for the most part lately. I like figurative work, and I encourage that in our space because it needs to have a forum. The Bushwick aesthetic of “found art” or “recycled art” is interesting as well. That is, when it’s done with some aesthetic consideration it can be very interesting.,Paul’s show [Appearance Adrift in the Garden] at Norte Maar is in line with that aesthetic. He has the chops to back it up and make it engaging, which I respect.,I always look for something that is emotionally expressive. Some people go internal like Antoinette [Johnson] and some go external like Grant [Stoops]. There are circumstances and stimuli that form around the artists work that engage different viewers on different levels. We try very hard to have art that is engaging and emotional.,What makes people like Nick Greenwald interesting is the execution of their mark-making and the attitude they express. It’s simple. It’s raw emotion versus emotional rawness, like painting versus photography.,[quote]There is a definite decline in the level of craftsmanship in some of the stuff I’ve been seeing out and about. This could be a misguided attempt at modesty, the result of ADD or the latest attempt at irony.[/quote],A painting is many different things. It’s an object in three dimensional space that exists, it’s a crystallization of the artist’s Chi that went into it. The best paintings, or the ones that interest me most, are the purest distillation of the artist’s life force.,That’s what most photography can never have. A photograph is a reflection, with photography it’s mostly the  case that what you see through your device is what you get. In painting, it’s not like that. Painting relies on the conviction of internal vision. Painting is ruthless [laughs], because, what’s in your head may not be that interesting, or you may not have the craft it takes to communicate what’s there. Photography is always one step removed from where your head is, whether it’s staged or digitally manipulated, it depends on a plastic device to some degree.,When it comes to photography I like Worm [Carnevale], he’s as close to painting as a photographer can get. He is relentless in exploring how to make an conventional photograph more personal.  You look at his work and it’s like looking into his mind. What you see in there may freak you out, and that’s what makes it so interesting.,There is a definite decline in the level of craftsmanship in some of the stuff I’ve been seeing out and about. This could be a misguided attempt at modesty, the result of ADD or the latest attempt at irony.,I am also heartily sick of art that comments on the social media phenomenon.,Personally, I’ve been in the luckiest situation, surrounded by amazing art, living with it every day. We’ve carefully curated this gallery to show positive artwork and I think we have been successful at it, but we can always do more. I want 950 Hart Gallery to continue expanding and growing and I look forward to meeting and showing more new artists, and expanding the available options for our existing crew.,What’s the future of this space? I don’t know, we could all be evicted. I think that we have to acknowledge that this has been an immense labor of love which came at great cost to the chief operators, both in treasure and in emotional strain.,So let’s look at where it got us. One of the most amazing years of my life. Antoinette, Mikki and I have produced incredible bodies of work given what we had. You’ve documented this whole process and probably have enough material for a series of novels.,Have the benefits outweighed the costs? Well, yes and I’m not panicking.",Sean Alday is a writer originally from the Florida Keys and now residing in Bushwick. He is the co-director at 950 Hart where he curates art shows in his home and asks you to come in and see. He can usually be found talking to someone.

And if these phenomenal artists are somehow not enough to get you to what we think is one of the best venues in Bushwick, there will be free dinner served from 8-9pm, so don’t be fashionably late (or you’ll be fashionably hungry and disappointed in yourself.) Admission is $7-$15 sliding donation at the door. RSVP on , here.,But how does this show stand apart from the rest of the fabulous shows in our neighborhood? All of the proceeds are going towards funding the ,, and 90% of that money goes directly to the artists participating. The Vis-a-Vis Project is a brand new festival unlike anything that has happened in Brooklyn, and exactly what it needs. The project will be happening in June, so stay tuned for more information about performers and artists as the date approaches. Below is an interview between myself and Rachael Pazdan, the founder and director of the project, and an all-around nifty chick.,A cosmic make-out session in your parents basement between all DIY artists, collectives and spaces in Brooklyn.,Nothing like this has been done before here. It’s more than coming together for a party, show, or opening; it’s about cultivating local artists and exhibiting their work with monetary support behind it.,We are attempting to bring together ALL arts collectives and groups that exist in Brooklyn + DIY space groups/owners to meet each other and talk about new ideas, collaborations, issues they face within DIY culture and how to resolve them.,On the 3, night, we are curating an interdisciplinary performance inviting over 20 collectives and artists in Brooklyn (dance, music, video art, film, spoken word, theater, etc.) who will collaborate and use audience interaction. We are using 93% of our budget to PAY all of these artists so that they may continue to create.,RP: While non-profit arts organization struggle to stay a float, DIY artists and venues in Brooklyn endure with the bare essentials. The work made is usually better than most things out there right now because of the innovation and creativity that goes behind creating work with essentially nothing, and performing or showing it in a space that is unusual, and sometimes limiting. It’s the attitude of “you can support us or not, you can pay attention or not, it will still be created and be more innovative than anything else out there”. I also am drawn to the sense of community and encouragement amongst the different spaces, artists and collectives in Brooklyn.,There are really 3 major goals with this project:,We want to bridge the gap between the more established collectives in Brooklyn who more or less pioneered the scene circa 2004/2005 with newer emerging spaces and collectives. I want them to meet and connect and collaborate.,The second major goal is to create an atmosphere in this community that is ultra supportive of artists monetarily. We need to fundraise and pay these artists so that they can continue to create and be inspired, and I want to show that it’s possible!,Lastly, I want to bring outside visibility to Brooklyn DIY artists by inviting people at BAM, people at City Center, The Kitchen, college professors, parents, students, and strangers to come experience the performance evening face to face (ahem…see definition: vis-à-vis).,The Compendium, which was started by a few members including Ian Colletti who operates Vaudeville Park do a similar type of festival with curators and artists. But no, I haven’t heard of anything quite like this…fingers crossed!,The goal is to get this going twice a year!,I am excited for the lecture by a few of the members of Punk Drunk/Sleep No More to talk about creative producing at one of the talk back nights. I am also psyched to curate the performance night! It’s all amazing and we’ve had a lot of great support so far, I can only hope for that to grow as the time gets nearer to the festival!","Artist, gallerist, and bike enthusiast.","Bermuda Bonnie,Big Snow Buffalo Lodge,DJ Pete Fonda,Happening,I'm Turning Into...,New Atlantic Youth,PORCHES,Rachel Pazdan,Vis a Vis","

Arts and Culture,"Last Friday, a tiny storefront previously known as ,, nowadays mainly referred to as ,filled up from wall to wall. And it wasn’t a deadline to file taxes…. Kirk Stoller, a young man from a small farm in Portland, Oregon, was asked by lovely Deborah Brown to exhibit his sculptures and installations in the said premises. And oh yeah, he did. Storefront frequently exhibits paintings, so it was nice to see a less traditional exhibition. Small sculptures were precariously installed on the walls, in the corner, and one was even hanging above the entrance door. The pieces rely on each other for strength, in actual form or through a labyrinth of memories. Kirk uses bright natural colors and variety materials., , , ,In the project room, my heart was overflown with warmth. Bushwick artist Brent Owens curated an intimate show ,as an extension of his own project ,. Brent Owens, Rachael Morrison, David Pappaceno, and Don Pablo Pedro created objects deriving inspiration from the busy, commercial Knickerbocker Avenue in Bushwick. The objects felt familiar as feels a walk on Knickerbcker Ave., , ,I enjoyed what the conceptual shift did to the work of Don Pablo Pedro. This eclectic artist typically paints on a canvases rolled in the papyrus style. His work resembles Egyptian hieroglyphs and Indian mythology amended with the impressions  of his own lucid dreams. Genitalia, multiple heads or limbs, blue, gold, green bodies of his characters who are beautiful as well as disturbing at the same time. Don Pablo Pedro is quite on his own out there, standing and waving from a paradise meadow, while we all are in Bushwick.  In other words, watch out for Pedro, he is blowing out in Bushwick, and might soon blow out also elsewhere. For ,, Pedro created tiny versions of this work. The genitalia on small rolled canvases were tiny too. His work gained additional dimension of humor referring to the dollar stores and small cheap but shiny objects you can easily purchase on Knickerbocker., ,Another piece that captured my attention was ,, a newspaper from 1892. I instatly thought that that’s basically a Bushwick Daily predecessor, and started to read in order to derive inspiration from an old timey source. I was very amused by the article ,informing Bushwickians that Mr. Ramsay of Bushwick Ave is seeking an absolute divorce from his wife Annie, who on “several occasions had departed from her matrimonial obligations in favor of Alexander J. Peck.” Instatnly, I thought: Yeah, a gossip column for Bushwick Daily; who’s dating who; who departed from their matrimonial obligations HA-HAAA!?, , ,I insist you guys go and read , at , at 16 Wilson Ave in Bushwick. , and , in the project room run until April 15, and are both great!, ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

Opinion,"Bushwick is not only a neighborhood in New York. It is a living organism that changes dynamically as the time passes every couple of months. It seems that the emotional landscape of the neighborhood reacts extremely sensitively to any kind of a development; sometimes just an idea is enough. What was true yesterday can be very different tomorrow.,What causes the change?  And more importantly will the change be to the benefit of all of the people living here? I certainly hope so. Is it even possible that everyone benefits from a change? Can you reasonably ask for a neighborhood not to change?  I know that the media are not a direct cause of a change but nobody can deny that they have a huge influence. Mainly, when a source like , drops a word about the neighborhood, a community matter suddenly becomes a matter of interest to the entire city, sometimes even the entire world.,Here are some of the articles that NY Times wrote about Bushwick and what followed after them.,[dropcap],[/dropcap],In March 2006, , brought an , focusing mostly on real estate development in the neighborhood. The Times followed a Bushwick realtor, Tom Le, who described Bushwick as the next new neighborhood where you can still buy a family house for $500K. The article also talks about the first “cool” places that opened in the area: Life Café, Brooklyn Natural, Northeast Kingdom, Archive Café, Chez Bushwick…,You can read about the first artists who came to the neighborhood and remodeled industrial buildings into artist studios. It also mentions a predecessor to Bushwick Open Studios, ,.,At least two dozens of “cool” places opened in the area: restaurants, cafes, bars. Sometimes it seems that a new bar opens every day.,Bushwick Art Project is dead, and we are celebrating 6th birthday of ,, a huge event to promote local art that was born shortly after Brooklyn Art Project ceased to exist.,Oddly enough, you can still buy a family house in Bushwick for $500K. Blame/ thank to the recession of 2008., ,[quote]Perhaps those most affected by a neighborhood’s nextness are the people who are already living there, the people who have been living there for years and are not necessarily looking for a place to install a video-dance piece but are trying to live, maybe even raise children. In this case, these are the people living in what a real-estate agent might at this moment be calling Deep Bushwick, that place with tired but well-swept row houses along Knickerbocker Avenue or in and around Wyckoff Avenue, another old commercial strip.[/quote],[dropcap],[/dropcap],Real Estate section of The Times brought this optimistic article celebrating , men and women living in Cedar House in Bushwick.  It was 2010, and the writed called Bushwick the coolest neighborhood in the world. The Times visited Cedar House on Bushwick Ave inhabited by young and creative people with lotsa interests. The original resident of Cedar House, Ben Shapiro walked the Times writer through the personal histories of the inhabitants, and thorough the events they organize in  Cedar House. The Times was very excited about these guys.,The line about Bushwick being the coolest place on the planet pissed off several ,. However, I have to second that, and yes, I think Bushwick is still the coolest place on the planet. Maybe not in the Morgantown area anymore, but there is still a lot of cool things and inspiring people living here. Also, places like Cedar House where residents happily open their doors to musicians and artists and fellow Bushwickians still exist.,[quote]Bushwick may not be East Williamsburg. But for those seeking the newest Bohemia, this neighborhood is arguably the coolest place on the planet.  And few places are cooler than the white brick building with black trim that its residents call Cedar House, courtesy of its location on the corner of Cedar Street.[/quote],[dropcap], [/dropcap],Ken Johnson was the first Times critic ever to review an art show in Bushwick. Justen Lada: ,, was a show on view in , gallery. This short write up appeared in ,, the Times art blog, which generally writes about experimental topics (at least according to the Times measures).,After this review, the Times art critics lost fear of Bushwick basement/apartment galleries, and many other art spaces celebrated a write up in NY Times. Absolutely well-deserved. Also nothing sells out a show like a shiny review, therefore in the name of support of local arts, please NY Times, come more often!,[quote]With this lovely, small exhibition, [Justen Lada’s] first solo in a , since 1998, he takes a surprising turn toward simplicity.[/quote], ,[dropcap],[/dropcap], ,Roberta’s, originally a hip low-key pizza place received 2 stars from poshy Times food critic.  The review took us on an amusing journey of what a Times writer thinks of a Bushwick resident’s afternoon (,), but also talked about some interesting facts of the restaurant’s operation and food preparation (,.),Roberta’s used to be great. I will never forget my first time there.  After a photo-assistant gig, I was tired but happy biting into a delicious slice of pizza sitting on a wood bench, and everything felt so Bushwick… Well, this is over now.  Less and less of the reasonable Bushwicians are willing to wait two hours for a table. Also the crowd is not what it used to be… Artists at Roberta’s are more likely to be waiting the tables than having a dinner. Don’t get me wrong, the fame of Roberta’s is well deserved (organic farm, radio station, blah blah), but it’s just too much. It’s not Bushwick anymore.,[quote]Roberta’s pizzas are marvelous things, of no particular geographical provenance. They are just good ingredients married well, then cooked in hot, fragrant smoke and quickly served. You can always have those.[/quote], ,[dropcap],[/dropcap], ,Six years and two days after The Times brought ,, Fashion & Style section of  NY Times, published a cover story about Bushwick as the next gallery district. We all read it and frantically shared on our social media, with a cocktail of feelings (1 part of pride, 1 part of wondering about all the things they got wrong; 1 part wondering what the future of our block will be)., talks about new galleries that sprung all over the neighborhood lately, and dedicates the most of its attention to the 56 Bogart building. In fact the article implies that 56 Bogart is the center of the universe. The building has only recently undergone quite a big transformation. Originally a textile factory was like many other industrial buildings in the neighborhood, turned into an artist studio building, but unlike the rest of the buildings it was turned into a gallery mall in the last 6 months.  A concept unseen in Bushwick, but frequent elsewhere, puts a number of galleries under one roof, has been perceived by the Bushwickians as bitter sweet. On one hand, you can’t deny the energy that a concentration of art spaces brings, and the openings at 56 Bogart tend to be epic.  On the other hand, DIY feel so beautiful about Bushwick, has definitely evaporated when you come in. The galleries at 56 Bogart are still quite cool, but I suggest The Times to venture to an opening at apartment galleries , or , or street art gallery ,. I guarantee crowds comparable to those attending openings at 56 Bogart.,Only time will tell.,[quote]But for now, the center of the action is at 56 Bogart, and as with any gallery nexus, it comes alive during openings.[/quote], , , ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

Music," ,We at Bushwick Daily are proud to announce the second coming of Bushwick-based radio station, ,! With a whole new website, blog, and weekly live series, the station has re-marketed itself as a force to be reckoned with, in Brooklyn and beyond. I visited their studio over on Meserole street, which was nestled into a dark warehouse neighboring ,, one of the hood’s most buzzed-about new venues. I talked to Colin Ilgen, who runs the station with two partners, Mark Brinda and Tariq Abdus-Sabur, as he discussed Newtown’s history and future., ,The idea of Newtown was conceived by Mark upon returning back to New York from a surfing trip in Costa Rica about three years ago. Founded in a place of calm, the stations current reputation is anything but excellent. The guys rented out their studio and got the ball rolling by bringing fresh, tasteful, and local music to the masses.,The station now is run by 20-30 weekly DJs and boasts over 20 shows playing a huge variety of music and ranging drastically in theme. The shows are like podcasts, except they are in real time, and they are both sassy and informative, with titles to match. ,which runs on Sundays from 7-9pm and features a blend of soulful music- from electronic to r&b and shoegaze with an uplifting energy. ,is a Monday-night punk and hardcore installment which often features live performance and is always laden with satirical commentary. Most interesting is their show ,, which describes itself as a “venue for audio storytellers and sound artists, an opportunity to build, to experiment, to explore with sound and narrative.” Indeed, the show samples a range of sounds and audio effects, in a scattered narrative form that is both interesting, impressive, and unlike anything I’ve heard on the radio before.,The station streams 24/7, and when no DJ is actively spinning, there are intensely concocted playlists, featuring a menage of local Brooklyn musicians, hot tracks off of a large collection of indie music blogs they scour, and “undiscovered classics”- sometimes strange, sometimes feel-good,  but always quality tracks off from obscure vinyls.,Revamping the ,is the station’s new vision for providing high-quality in-studio recordings from A-list indie musicians on the air. The first ever session was a stream of New York’s , performing and aired in the summer of 2010, and soon after featured guests from MillionYoung to Secret Colors.,More recently, , has gathered steam as a forum for live performances. First of all, they moved recording to ,‘s recording studios, which has done wonders for the sound. Secondly, they’ve attracted big names such as Minks, The Beets, and Lower Dens to do sessions. Most recently the featured Bushwick’s own lo-fi psychadelic dreamweavers DIVE, whose session you can watch on ,.,All in all, it’s pretty clear that Newtown is filling a Brooklyn-wide niche as an internet radio station that has its sights set as much more than that. They are picking up and taking their recording equipment down to SXSW starting tomorrow where they will be streaming three live showcases, including two showcases with IMPOSE magazine plut a Death+Taxes / Solid Gold PR day party. For all of you who wish you could experience South By first hand, here’s a pretty good way to pretend you’re there, all from a ,. The first Impose party streams Wednesday night and will feature anny Brown, Mr. eXquire, Main Attracktionz and more. Thursday Afternoon hear Young Prisms, Caveman and more at Death + Taxes showcase. Lastly, Impose’s indie party will stream live featuring Dirty Beaches, Crocodiles and Bleeding Rainbow, along with a handful of other wildcard goodies.,Back in Brooklyn they are hosting an official “re-coming out” ,on March 31st at ,, where they will be “ throwing down with two floors full of aural goodness” featuring some allstar DJs, bands, and of course, the coolest DJs around.,

Opinion,"Since the beginning of the Occupation, there has been a war of perception for Occupiers to fight on two fronts. From some on the right, we are fighting against the simplistic assumption that the Occupation is just a bunch of whining beggars looking for handouts. Others on the left, we are an unserious, misguided nuisance. From my vantage point working within the movement, I believe the Occupation has proven its worth in many ways overlooked by those who haven’t been witnessing it first hand.,Here are four reasons why I’m proud to continue supporting OWS:,I was never a full-time Occupier. Aside from the sleepover organized by ,, I was never able to spend more than a few hours at a time in Zuccotti. After I first visited the park on October 4th, I couldn’t get back enough. I would go on my lunch break, after work, on weekends, usually alone, and more than a few times with my family. Not , in any of that time in the park did I feel like it was an unsafe place to be. I knew that if anyone made me feel threatened, I could always just yell “Mic check! Asshole!”, point to the offending asshole, and consider myself covered. That never happened, but the point is that any reports that Zuccotti was full of dangerous, volatile people did not square with what I saw first hand. As such, the disproportionately large police presence constantly surrounding the park seemed almost comical if one didn’t pause to consider the intent and effect of this enforcement policy: to intimidate others from participating.,The first time I , felt unsafe in Liberty Plaza was the ,, with the police in full riot gear and pepper spraying the crowd, seemingly at random. When you are dealing with cops in this situation, there is no reasoning with them and no predicting when they will decide to single you out, the only thing you can do is stay as far away as possible. That night, and other , of police , and ,, have successfully exposed the , nature of our police force.,One of the most forceful advocates against these practices to emerge from the OWS movement has been Captain Ray Lewis of the Philadelphia PD (retired). He has been present at OWS events since at least November 17th when , as part of a day of direct action. Lewis now speaks regularly to local occupations and other OWS affinity groups about the troubling trends in police enforcement that he has seen as both cop and protestor.,OWS has also helped bring much needed attention to the recent passage of the ,, as well as lesser-known, but equally abhorrent local law enforcement policies such as “,“. From the , to the , at Goldman Sachs, The , , of those who were , helped show what happens beyond the protecting eye of citizen controlled media. Speaking of controlling the media…,
Source: ,Within my first hour of stepping foot in Liberty Plaza, I was approached by a reporter  who asked me why I had come. I went on for about 10 minutes talking through and working out what has now been refined into my standard spiel of concerns. Then he moved on to talk to another person. Everywhere I looked, there were other camera crews talking to other ordinary people, people who weren’t getting that kind of amplification in August.,For far too long, there have been too many ,, ,, and , , who have dominated the political conversation in print and on television. They don’t see a , with ,, they don’t understand the ,, and they don’t know the first thing about truly holding power accountable.,At just about any major OWS event you can expect to talk to the media. I’ve now got my reasons for supporting this movement boiled down to a handful of concrete talking points.,Write up your own bullet points, things that go unsaid on any major network, and make them heard! More importantly, listen to the concerns being voiced around you. Show up at an upcoming , Popup Occupation, and you’ll have plenty of opportunities to do both.,I have no idea what I’m doing. All I’ve done is keep in touch with people I’ve met at Zuccotti and working group meetups. More and more as I started to take advantage of the networks OWS has established and the momentum of the initial Occupations, there seems to be no limit to the possibilities. That rosy optimism comes from meeting so many other folks who are equally “green”, and equally driven to see this movement succeed. I would say that about 50-75% of the people I’ve met and worked with so far in this movement are similar to me in that they have almost no prior experience in non-partisan activism.

In my own social circle alone, I know of dozens of people who are now , in and , about politics than they were prior to the Occupation.,The beauty of Occupy is that more and more people are recognizing that if you want to help the movement and keep it centered and honest, you can step up and be an organizer, a facilitator, a broadcaster, a tweeter, or a donor (of time, money or ,). Even if it should all fade and fizzle, no one who is passionately working to support OWS will suddenly stop to caring and become inactive should those three letters cease to have cultural relevance. Too many of us have found our voice will not return silent acquiescence of the status quo. By the end of spring, we should be able to walk without teetering too badly, and who knows, maybe by fall we’ll be ready to ,.,
Source: ,Winners and losers, that’s what the world of politics is based upon today. One year, you’re the dominant party, the next you’re in decline. What I have discovered through the OWS movement is the process of achieving consensus, which can be a far more satisfying form of democracy. This process comes with its own ,, but so does voting. The current two-party system has severely narrowed the range of acceptable debate, and local government isn’t the proper forum to address the fundamental institutional changes that need to take place in American society. The OWS General Assembly provides us with a different path.,My early experience with the GA in Zuccotti was a mixed bag. I would pop in and out of a few of the outdoor public GAs to help out on people’s mic, throw up my happy hands when I liked what I heard, and then pop out. I simply couldn’t attend enough to feel invested in the process. When I later tried to participate in the “Spokes Council” meeting, as a representative for Parents for Occupy Wall St., the process was continually derailed by disruptive people (who have since lost all credibility within the movement). I eased my worry about these problems by reminding myself that as a culture, we really don’t have a lot of experience in civic participation. To anthropomorphize this movement, back then we were just a baby learning how to rollover. Right about now, we’re actually learning how to crawl and move forward deliberately.,The folks who meet regularly at the , are definitely moving forward. I’ve been most excited about this new channel to support OWS, because it has proven to be the most dedicated and spirited. No one has been afraid to voice their concerns about any topic, and everyone attending so far is capable of dissenting , derailing the process or the conversation.

Music," ,This week’s mix takes me back to going record shopping for gigs, looking for new tracks to weave into an upcoming event.  Now, most record stores have closed, and buying music is done right from your laptop.  I used to drive into Manhattan on Friday nights, Sunday afternoons, and any other time there was quality house music being spun at clubs that had the right vibe (most we frequented didn’t even serve alcohol, because NOBODY there was drinking).  We’d make calls, get flyers, wait on lines, get pulled over and searched by undercover cops, make it through metal detectors and bouncers, all to finally be in the presence of the forbidden sounds of house music (“alternative life-style clubs”, as I remember one cop called them).,Entering clubs and raves back then to me was like discovering some underground love ritual.  My favorite DJs would drop tracks that blew my mind months and months before you’d ever see the record show up in a shop.  The sounds were meticulously selected and spun with long overlapping times between both records.  The suspense of feeling the beat push up, back, high, to way down… the DJ yielding his own rhythm and dynamics from behind the decks.  At first, I never even knew they were using records!  I’d see DJs bouncing, moving, pushing buttons, twisting knobs, bending down and shooting back up, like a control-station above the crowd equipped with the sounds we heard.  I remember being amazed by the concept that there were two songs playing and it wasn’t the DJ adding or subtracting sounds, it was the improvisational magic factor of beat-matching two records live and EQing and filtering to make it all dance seamlessly.,Here are some tracks I just bought this week in preparing for , this Saturday, March 10th- I’ll be spinning from 6-10pm at ,!","jojoSOUL is a DJ/drummer/music-maker/teacher from Long Island, NY, residing in Bushwick, Brooklyn.","Beat Nite,Brooklyn,Bushwick,Bushwick Daily,Factory Fresh,Happening,jojo's mixtape,music,New York","

Arts and Culture,"Certainly NOT a traditional gallery setting. When entering  , in DUMBO, you’ll encounter a pair of ,in the lounge area with a pot leaf on them strewn above your head.  Penises, breasts and vaginas are everywhere! And I mean everywhere. This is actually very appropriate however, because in the same exposed manner, Alex Emmart, the director of the space, left nothing of his thoughts of the art world to the imagination. And I mean nothing.,The striking not-so-private parts are part of the current show at the Gallery called ,, and are created by artist,. Also featured in the show is the artist ,, who also follows suite in bearing the bones of her artwork.  Even though the pieces are striking and provide an electric and exciting energy in the space, plopping down on the soft leather couch in the middle of the gallery is actually encouraged. Alex emanates this exuberant combination of cool and joy that obviously translates into the work shown in the space. He believes that an art space should be fist and foremost an inviting place to connect with art and each other. “My art, I feel is the art of interpretation,” he said. “It’s the ability to display artwork in a way that engages the trifecta. The pieces communicate, the person viewing the art communicates with the work, and the people in the space communicate with each other.”,This appeared to work wonderfully as we sat comfortably and discussed the mission of his gallery and the trends in his collections. Even though the gallery is in DUMBO, Alex is Bushwick resident who is totally inspired by his neighborhood. “Bushwick is the largest pool of artists you can find of completely random cool stuff, so a large percent of artists I work with live in Bushwick, have studios in Bushwick or ties to Bushwick in one way or another. So that’s really been one of my biggest influences with finding artists.”,The Mighty Tanaka Gallery, named after a badass little league baseball player, will have a booth this weekend at ,. Be sure to stop by to check out the work that is made by “us” for “us.” Alex spoke about the fact that many galleries are showing outrageous and expensive pieces to sell to high end collectors; something he feels sometimes hinders the experience of the viewer. “What’s most important is that it’s the voice of our generation, and that we are displaying ourselves as individuals who are working with a wide spectrum of art,” Alex said. “I want to switch it up and be fresh I want to ride the crest of what’s happening of the now.”,We went on to discuss the very relatable and approachable pieces he had in his gallery. “I really try hard to kind of remove that glass wall that separates the average person for the gallery experience. There’s been this elitism that goes along with fine art. We’re young people and we’re into cool shit, and just because it doesn’t look like I’m going to be buying art doesn’t mean I don’t want to have this experience.”,There is no doubt that when he sets up his booth at The Fountain Art Fair this weekend, there will be a lot of “completely random cool stuff” that is relatable, fresh and exciting to see. I half expect to see a couch in there as well., , ","On a mission to expose the NYC art scene for what it is - fun, inspiring and exciting!

In the Hood,"Before you cringe about thinking about your naked nanna, let’s start off by saying this is not the kind of Gilf you are probably thinking of. “It’s kind of like my secret word for me,” the street artists began to explain as she meticulously cuts and measured a stencil.  “I know what it means, but everyone else thinks it means something different. It’s light hearted, where my work can be really heavy.” , of course isn’t her birth name, but the name she uses as she uses the street as her canvas to spread awareness about social, political and environmental issues.,If you entered Gilf’s studio and living space without prior knowledge of her line of work, you may mistake her for someone on the White House’s most wanted list, and she’d probably take that as a compliment. Aggressive red signs that read “Stop Corporate Douchebags” stand not too far from an almost ready stencil of Lady Liberty drinking the cool aid, literally, and multiple stencils that read “censorship” over and over.  A ridiculous and vomit worthy speech given by Rush Limbaugh plays in the background, no doubt to motivate her to continue making visually stunning pieces that stop and make the viewer think, as they give a voice to the underdog. ,I started doing street art to talk about stuff that people didn’t wanted to talk about,I feel that people feel hopeless about a lot of stuff and they don’t know how to deal with big issues that are facing us globally and culturally.  If I can talk to them in a visual sense, maybe I can change their perspective over time.”,There is something so technically beautiful in Gilf’s rebellious work.   As a self-proclaimed tomboy, Gilf expressed that her childhood dream was to design cars. She went on to study engineering in college to make this dream a reality. After learning this was far less than a creative field, and fearing a long career of designing tail lights for a living, Gilf decided she wanted to enter a new path in life involving a more artistic approach that would inspire and help others. As a result, her work has almost a mathematical approach to perfection. She meticulously cuts tiny dots, fills almost invisible cracks, and spray paints letters so perfectly that these pieces often get confused with screen prints.  All of this hard work is made with the knowledge of the ephemerality of the street as canvas, and it doesn’t matter to her as long as her points get across. ,It’s about engaging everyday people on the street and opening a dialogue about important issues. I put it out there and hope it reaches people, I hope they go home and Google it and talk about it with their friends.”,Her latest projects will be shown at the upcoming,. One series portrays a play on vision charts that spell out things like “stop looking the wrong way” and “vision is impossible when your eyes are closed.” Other powerful pieces such as a stencil of a birth control wheel with the words “why are men making these decisions for us?” put in place of the days of the week, prove that her pieces aren’t just beautiful, but a call to action.,Another one of Gilf’s undertakings involves a gardening initiative to promote hunger awareness. A wooden structure resembling a tree is mounted to her studio wall, brushing the ceiling. Spaces where “branches” should go will be filled with blue pouches made from 100% recycled plastic. The pouches will contain soil and the seeds of an edible plant. Gilf dreams of building these structures on the sides of buildings in underprivileged neighborhoods in New York, as well as in countries struggling with hunger across the globe. ,The idea is to bring it to different places around the world that have been hit with war or natural disaster. I’d like to do this project with a community that’s been through the worst, to bring a collaborative spirit back to their world.”,Her name speaks volume’s to her work, even if we don’t know what it actually means. Our first reaction is to assume it is closely associated with the acronym, Milf. But like the messages in her work, things aren’t always what they seem, and we should never take what someone tells us, or doesn’t tell us for face value. Always challenge things you feel are unfair, and use whatever talents you have to make your voice heard and to open a dialogue. That’s what this Gilf taught me anyway.","On a mission to expose the NYC art scene for what it is - fun, inspiring and exciting!

Music," ,This week’s mixtape is focused on Emotional Depth.  These 20 tracks are personal favorites that I’ve assembled to share a more intimate scope of my own tastes beyond the dancefloor.  I have cried, reflected, sang along, and sat alone to these tracks, and their impact grows as time goes on.  Some I have heard for years, though didn’t take an interest in until I really discovered their true beauty.,As music is interpreted by the listener, I’ve found myself relating to these emotions and have empathized with their words and sounds beyond their popularity or their assumed audience.  For example, the first track is a song I’ve known for a long time, but only in the past few years did I hear it differently.  It made so much sense to me once I took its message and applied it to myself as the narrative, although the singer in this case is a woman.  That is the essence of my intention here.  I hope to push these songs across our comfortable understandings and into the areas we may keep more guarded, more intimate.  To have a song possess the listener’s deepest emotions transcends any self-identification and provides a glimpse of our souls that doesn’t care whether we are men or women, gay or straight, old or young, etc.  And in seeking these lessons that are hidden in the areas of our minds that we guard and limit due to feelings of inhibition, we open ourselves up to true freedom and emotions that were never supposed to be hidden.,The mixtape contains:","jojoSOUL is a DJ/drummer/music-maker/teacher from Long Island, NY, residing in Bushwick, Brooklyn.","Featured,Jojo Soul,jojo's mixtape,soundcloud","

Music,"New venues are popping up all over Bushwick with the influx of people the quickly-flourishing art and music scene. These new hot spots fall (for the most part) into two predictable catagories: fleeting-but-trendy DIY spots and highly-anticipated big, sleek, well-funded spots. There are the legendary DIY venues that live in creaky, old dingy apartment/mansions like the ever-ellusive , (scheduled to re-open one of these days…) and ,.

Performing here is a joy for musicians with the great PA system and stage. Plus the shows here are always affordable or free, so you can spend those extra bucks on savory Mexican food.,4. , - 1087 Broadway,This intimate coffee-shop-by-day takes on a whole different ambience by night. You’ll always recognize a photo taken inside this space because of the intricate and colorful stage set up or the cluttered outdoor performance space, which is jammed with vintage toys and other weird memorabilia. GBM is the kind of place where you’ll see your friend’s band play an enjoyable and memorable set to a quaint and attentive crowd.

People,"[quote]It’s good for people to be scandalized; it’s good for people to see all kinds of art and everybody should be able to show it. [/quote], Those are probably the first three things you will notice when meeting Elizabeth Tully. Elizabeth who is one of the two , producers, lives in a loft across the street from Roberta’s. We took a walk on a crazy windy day around the factories of Morgantown, and talked a lot about Foutain and Elizabeth’s involvement with it. Elizabeth started as an intern at  at , whose owners also happen to organize Foutain Art Fair, and it all went from there.,It’s just over a week before , starts in New York, and I was curious how Elizabeth handles Fountain’s organizational team, 60 exhibitors, and the huge space of ,where Fountain is taking place this year., ,In 2009, I was interning with Leo Kesting, and also I helped out at Fountain. I was just taking money at the door, but it was an incredible experience, and I have never seen anything like that. There was this amazing energy! Later, it was the time of Fountain Miami. We went down to Miami, and somebody who was scheduled to run the front door the entire time got sick just one day before the show, so I did it, and it was pretty insane! When we came back to New York, my internship ended and John [Leo] and Dave [Kesting] hired me, and it grew from there., ,Yes, Rachel Esterday and I are producers. She deals with all the logistics, and I deal with the gallery services.  She and I started at the same time.  In New York we both worked at Fountain, but we didn’t know each other, because I was at the door the whole time. Then we were in Miami together, and we became friends and we started having our private meetings as a preparation for the meeitings with John, David and the rest of the staff. We would go to have coffee at Think Coffee at Mercer Street, and to discuss all our ideas that we were so excited about. John and Dave have been doing this for years and they would always tell us: “Ok, show us a plan, give us a proposal.” And Rachel and I would go to Think and work on that. We kept them asking if we can change small things, and subsequently they have given us more responsibility.  We were like “Please let us do this!!!” It has been the best learning experience. I should have been in grad school now, because I was just applying when I started working with Leo Kesting.  But they don’t teach you at school what working at a gallery entails. As a major in art history you can name all the artists in the history, but they don’t teach you how to work in the art world., ,[quote]As a major in art history you can name all the artists in the history, but they don’t teach you how to work in the art world.[/quote],Rachel and I have gotten to a point where we play off each other.  She is like a rock, never shows anything, while I am the talker. I don’t mind being the bad guy. Just imagine a situation where multiple things go wrong at the same time. The Internet is down, exhibitors can’t sell art; an exhibitor has a piece of art stuck in UPS somewhere in the city but nobody knows where; and there is a scheduling conflict. What are you going to do? This all is very intense and so I try to keep a clear head.  I just put my game face on, because I know what it is and I am used to it.  Never show exhibitors something’s going wrong. Always maintain that: “How is it going? Are you enjoying the show? Your booth looks great!”,There is always this feeling of anticipation. It’s a combination of a little bit of nerves, a little bit of excitement, a little bit of unknown – , , You have been working with all these people; you laid all your plans, and now it’s the Go Time: , Then the exhibitors start showing up, and art is being installed, and that’s my favorite part… I love walking around as people are installing, and it’s this crazy energy that forms as everybody is working together. We have this thing “Shit Fountain People Say”: “Can I borrow your ladder? Can I borrow your drill? Do you guys have a wire? What about my lights?” And people are helping each other and loaning each other things. I love seeing the exhibitors bringing this amazing art, and getting along with each other. Our team is so energetic. You can feel this ,, I can’t explain it. You are like: “Wow! This is going to be amazing!” Art in your face! That’s my favorite part!, ,I just keep my phone on! As the Fair progresses, I like to do laps. I am trying to say hi to everybody in the morning and see what’s up, if everybody is happy, if they are having fun, if they sold anything. I also learned that you have to take breaks. Take an hour and shut off. Let somebody else be on the floor…, ,That’s also my tattoo [Elizabeth shows her tattoo on a forearm]. I got one in Miami this year! It was my 7th show. Well, the idea of Fountain Art Fair is to support egalitarian spirit in art. Art for art sake. I mean of course we also want people to sell,  but mainly we think that if you have great art, you should be able to show it. What’s nice about it is that it’s becoming really viable. Other art fairs, museums, art organizations and the people whose attention was hard to get in the past are becoming interested in what we are doing. That was the whole purpose of the fair, and of the ,. Duchamps scandalized people with his ,, and that’s good. It’s good for people to be scandalized; it’s good for people to see all kinds of art and everybody should be able to show it. These other fairs are wonderful, but if you’re a young gallery, young artist who is just starting out and are working to pay your bills, it can be really hard to participate, and we provide that space. I think it’s really important., ,[quote]Art in your face! That’s my favorite part![/quote],We are celebrating seven years. We are one of the youngest fairs.,I can speak only for Fountain, but I feel like it’s wonderful because it gives all these new people voice and a platform to be seen when when all the people are in town to see art. They will meet all the VIPs; maybe they will get coverage in Time Out NY or New York Magazine. I think that is beneficial to the artists and to the art world. There is new talent and there is opportunity to be recognized for your art. I think we do a service to the art world because we keep it alive and fun. Fountain isn’t just white boxes and boring art. I think it’s beautiful, because the whole thing is beautiful. The fair is art itself. The art show feels like a big explosion of craziness. I think it exposes art to a lot of people who aren’t normally exposed to art, because people come with their friends who tell them how much fun it was last year. That’s bringing art to people., ,I graduated as an art history major from Hunter in 2006. I was commuting every day from Long Island; I was waitressing full-time and going to school full time. It was constant “hustling” and it was really intense. The art fair is really intense too, but I’m enjoying it, and when it’s not happening I am kinda bored…, ,We have almost 60 exhibitors; last year we had 25, so it’s growing a lot. The day we signed the lease for the ,, I couldn’t believe it… The Fountain on the pier was amazing, but it’s kinda hard to get there, because the subway is a little far and there is a highway, so you can’t get dropped off by a taxi there, and all those little things…So having the space, especially with , is just the most exciting thing. I still can’t believe it. It’s really great and we are so happy., ,Everybody’s effort on the team is amazing. You don’t get paid much doing something like this, obviously, so to do it you really have to love it and be passionate about it. And just having all these people around and all this energy is amazing., ,It helps that we don’t get paid a lot, because it keeps the people who are really passionate about it around. But you know if I could quit my babysitting job, if all of us could quit our day jobs, and just sit in the office and play with Fountain all day, that’s my dream… But for now, it’s not possible. The grassroots of Fountain feel really satisfying. I feel like I am working on something with my friends for my friends. It’s for all of us to shine: for the people on the team, for our artist and gallery friends, for everyone. I put so many of my artist friends in the show, and so did everybody on the team. It’s so great to be in the position where you are able to help out people. I didn’t have that when I was starting out. Epecifically there is so many amazing young women!, , ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily. She can easily be moved by reflection of the sky in a puddle.

By our seat-of-the-pants calculations, the volume of misleading posts and spam have climbed upwards faster than the , that are springing up all over this neighborhood.,“Some call it Bushwick, some call it East Williamsburg—we’ll call it whatever you want,” said Rachel, a real estate broker, in a pleasant voice when we inquired about a rental property on Irving Avenue and Jefferson Street.,Rachel’s job is to fill vacancies as quickly as possible and to appeal to whatever sensibilities a perspective tenant may have when he or she conducts a search. She won’t try to convince you that , is not in Bushwick or that East Williamsburg does not exist. But among those of us who are not in the real estate business, there are certainly enough people who do argue these and subsequent opposing viewpoints.,Before the eye-rolling and deep guttural groaning begins, we would like to pose a simple two-part question: Does this matter and why?,The flippant answer would be that it doesn’t.,But we believe that, to some extent, it does and we were willing to put in the legwork to figure this out once and for all.,Our first step was to define the word “neighborhood”. , to do so falls in line with the ,—that the concept of a neighborhood is subjective.,To make things more difficult, a representative from the NYC Department of City Planning told us that there are no official neighborhood boundaries. Instead, the city recognizes the , that were created in 1975, before which the five boroughs were divided into ,. Predating even that Bushwick was the much larger ,, which also included Williamsburg and Greenpoint.,Today’s Bushwick lies within the borders of Brooklyn Community District 4. It is defined by Flushing Avenue, Broadway, the Queens border and the Evergreen Cemetery. These lines are clearly documented on ,. So it seems that “community district” is just administrativese for “neighborhood”. Case closed?,It’s not entirely so simple. Community District 1, for example, is made up of five distinct neighborhoods—Park Slope, Carroll Gardens, Red Hook, Gowanus and Cobble Hill.,However, if we look to Google Maps, which uses APIs like , to overlay neighborhood borders, we’ll see that Bushwick’s boundaries are identical to the city’s community district lines.,Similarly, vintage map reseller , has maps that show the neighborhood, then referred to as Ward 11, as bound by Flushing Avenue to the north, Broadway to the west and “Cemetery of the Evergreens” to the south, with only the Queens/Newton border in dispute.,With all this in mind, we have to remember that a neighborhood is not only defined by the arbitrary lines drawn by people that died long before any of us were born. A neighborhood also embodies a sense of community, culture and familiarity. Your neighborhood is the local store you can always count on, the crack in the sidewalk you usually remember to avoid and the familiar faces on stoops and at Laundromats.,In Bushwick specifically there are the blocks—or steps, for the luckier of us—to the L and M trains; the open fire hydrants in the summer; and the innumerable bodegas, galleries, Botanicas, record stores, eateries and bars.,What Bushwick is all depends on who is asked.

In the Hood,"During my entire Brooklyn career, I’ve lived exclusively, in tiny apartments. ’Humble,’ I like to call them. Through the trials and tribulations of hiding things in boxes under my bed, feeling locked in a cage, and knocking things over, I discovered 5 easy tips to maximizing the small space I call mine.,Walls are good for more than just shelves. I like to hang functional things that could also serve as good decoration. In my last apartment my bedroom had no closet, so I nailed a bunch of hooks into the wall and hung my most decorative dresses. This kept my otherwise white-room warm, and allowed me to get a good grip on what I wanted to wear each day. This idea could be awesome with anything you have excess of.,There is no sense in getting a regular fixture if you can get something that also stores stuff or doubles as something else. Something like these ottomans can be used as a cushioned stool and for storage too. They’re kind of pricey at Target, but you can usually find them for under $20 at a furniture store in Brooklyn or Queens.,Modern looks are great for apartments; they feel open and airy. Unfortunately, if you have a small, aged place like many Brooklyners, this look is difficult to achieve as old places get dirty very easily. White can also feel intuitional if your windows don’t offer much light and you have small rooms. Many designers suggest light colors to make your room look bigger. I did this with my bathroom, but I also found other ways to keep the room feeling light, but warm and lived in. , Unfortunately, there’s no way around it- when your place is small, you can’t always fit in everything you want. You should think about what your needs are and make the right sacrifices. Sacrifices also save in your wallet. An example is, our living room is tiny, so I sacrificed a coffee-table and picked up a small nightstand. I can still use its surface and drawer space for additional storage., It is inventible. A small spot is going to have stacks of stuff somewhere. The best thing to do, to avoid a pack-rat look, is to be conscious of where this happens. Places up high, or behind curtains where gunk is kept out of site are prime locations. For instance: In the bathroom we leave no gunk on the kitchen sink (face-wash, razors) but instead on the windowsill which is hidden behind the shower curtain., ","To me, life is meant to be classy-trashy.

People,"“Brooklyn is so brown when compared to Manhattan,” says Andrea Bergart when leaning on the fence at a pier. Manhattan looks like a toy city; you could just reach and touch the plastic buildings. Brooklyn, on the other hand, looks like its humble brother. The wind is fierce; our hair is flying around; the seagulls shriek as they are flying around. There are strange places in New York, and the , is certainly one of them.,Andrea lives in Ridgewood, but as an artist in residency at , uses a subsidized studio in an enormous fortress of Brooklyn Army Terminal at Sunset Park. The building is partially occupied by Chashama artists; partially is empty; and according to rumors, it partially serves as a storage for governmental super-secret documents…,Andrea loves it there. She has been in her studio since last May, and she can’t wait for the summer. She says the closeness to the water makes her feel connected to nature.  It is a bit ironic because the building itself is a huge concrete giant, and the neighboring vacated industrial buildings couldn’t be any less natural. But there is something serene and beautiful about the Brooklyn Army Terminal.,Andrea is a painter who has a great eye for colors and pattern. She has spent a lot of time in Western Africa painting murals and learning about textiles there. Her paintings are fresh and energetic; her vivid colors won’t let you idle. She uses a lot of imagery and techniques she remembers from her childhood – a pattern from an old coloring book; zebra and leopard patterns; she makes , and , into acrylic paint over crayon drawings…. She is one of the artists in , at Bushwick Gallery, and I had a couple of questions….,A lot of it is a return to my suburban upbringing – all the things I used to play with. I was always beading, braiding or weaving. Throughout my whole childhood, I was occupied with some kind of a craft. It seems natural to continue that. Additionally, I have always been making jewelry along the painting and drawing, so it seems natural to have my patterns translate across the media. Also weaving or beading designs help me generate the imagery…, ,I love this stuff! I have been thinking about doing this for months. And there is an element of surprise to them! I just create different patterns or movements with crayons, without thinking. AI make several drawings at the same time, cover them with black or blue paint and then quickly forget which pattern is hidden beneath.  When I start drawing into them with an exacto knife or a pushpin I realize which drawing I am working with. The surprise reminds me a little bit of printmaking…, ,I first ended up in Ghana studying bead making for a semester in college.   After graduate school, I was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to study patterns found in textiles, bead making, sign painting. It was an incredible year traveling throughout most of West Africa. I often travelled with bead traders on ancient bead trading routes taking me from Ghana to Timbuktu to Nigeria… I completed acouple of murals with Ghanaian painters and designed textiles with a major textile company that producestextiles for all of West Africa. That experience was incredible! Just generating patterns for a specific audience was great. Thinking: “This is for Nigeria, this is for Togo…” Every country had a little bit of a different design…. The company would reference traditional weaving but also try to make it contemporary… That was really great.,Last December, I went to do another mural in the neighborhood of North Keneshie which is located in Accra., ,Men control all the street painting. You would never see woman paint on the street. Also it’s a profession that is completely married with advertising, it is all utilitarian. So to see a mural painted by a painter not commercially invested is so strange to them… They were stopping by and asking: “What is this? Who paid you to do this?”  I collaborated with a couple of sign painters there, and referenced imagery from local garments, children’s murals, and personal textile designs. Everyone loved it and wanted to help.,Now in May, I am going to South Africa to visit the Ndebele who have a long tradition of women painting their homes with geometric patterns.  Their designs are amazing!, , , , ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

,Imagine taking a tour of an art gallery through someone’s mind, where each and every fold of the brain is another corridor leading you to a brilliant piece someone had once seen or thought of.  ,, a group show curated by Jason Andrew is currently on view at , in Chelsea feels exactly as a physical tour through an art gallery of the mind., is a show that features over 40 artists from the tight nit and burgeoning art scene in Bushwick that the curator and collector himself is very much a part of.  The opening night was packed with a sort of who’s who of the Bushwick art scene, those one would normally see hanging around , or ,. It was as if a space ship had sucked them all up and dropped them off in Chelsea.  Some , that this was the slightly less than unintentional plan of Jason Andrew himself, to swipe the artists from their homey-digs as Chelsea big-wig , opened their new space in Bushwick on that very night.,There is less than a visual theme that ties the show together.  Paintings seemed to work with drawings, drawings with sculpture, sculpture with collage. But despite a theme not being visibly apparent, it was clear that these pieces were tied together by community. In a statement in the gallery, Andrew ponders the fact that we live in a very uncertain era, and all we can really rely on is our creative wits. So whether it was Paul D’Agostino’s collage of clock cut outs ticking along near Brooke Moyse’s abstract painting “Kalied,” or Ben Godward’s giant blob of paint that looks like it had once wreaked havoc on a street, swallowing bottles and license plates in its colorful path – these ideas juxtaposed against one another in one space created a solidness and a comfort.,What , know, or can take from the show, is these great works are being thought of and created, and don’t just exist in a Bushwick vacuum. The show is unapologetic in being simply a massive collection of great, solid pieces. And because of that, there was a different feeling in the air in Chelsea that evening. A shift, a change, a quake could be felt in the art world.","On a mission to expose the NYC art scene for what it is - fun, inspiring and exciting!

,Last Friday night in Bushwick the normally desolate strip of Knickerbocker Avenue at Johnson was transformed by the inaugural opening of ,. The well-regarded Chelsea gallery opened its long-awaited Bushwick annex with a major show by pioneering video artist Charles Atlas.  Throughout the three hour opening–normal for Bushwick but long by Chelsea standards–a small crowd milled around outside the well-lighted, elegantly transformed former warehouse space. Well-heeled guests arrived in Dial cars while local artists gave directions to first-time visitors clearly flummoxed by the unfamiliar geography of the neighborhood.,Inside was a scene of contrasts.  Many local artists were in attendance including William Powhida, Stephen Truax, Will Pappenheimer, Carol Salmanson, Letha Wilson, and Max Warsh of the gallery collective Regina Rex.  But unlike openings at galleries run by local artists, many attendees were not Bushwick regulars. Marina Abramovic, Kathy Halbreich, Jerry Saltz and Roberta Smith could be seen in the wall-to-wall crowd, along with other art-world luminaries.  For much of the evening, co-owner Roland Augustine took up a post front-and-center in the foyer to greet arrivals, a gesture disarmingly gracious for a Chelsea gallery owner. Nonetheless, the contrasts and juxtapositions of the familiar and the exotic left many wondering whether this represented the end of the Bushwick art world they knew, an exciting new chapter in the history of the local art community, or something in between.,The artwork on display, Charles Atlas’s video installation, ,, is a tour de force. Entering the gallery through a dark corridor, the viewer encounters three darkened rooms open to one another onto which the videos are projected. Black and white images of geometric patterns unfurl, and cascades of numbers unspool in rapid succession.  James Panero, Managing Editor and art critic of ,, remarked that the experience was akin to being in “The Matrix,” a world in which humankind has been atomized into avatars of code.  The audience became part of the installation as the projections played across bodies and faces, enveloping everyone in the artist’s digital cabinet of wonder.,Luhring Augustine’s building had been under construction for over a year, resulting in a transformation largely invisible from the outside. The building’s red brick is painted a sober grey. The gallery’s name appears modestly on one of the entrances to the building. Inside, however, the full extent of the resources brought to bear is immediately apparent.  The space is huge and beautifully finished, capped by a wooden, cantilevered ceiling. It is as if a Chelsea space had been recreated in Bushwick–not entirely unexpected, but arresting to those used to the neighborhood’s DIY ethos and aesthetic. Given the gallery’s location across from a working cement factory and next to a Won Ton warehouse, Charles Atlas’s flickering videos call to mind an end-of-the world scenario, a Bushwick ,or Twilight of the Gods.,One viewer called it “enchanting,” a response that seemed to capture the frisson of excitement and wonder surrounding the arrival of this new presence on the landscape of the Bushwick art world.,Bushwick’s new neighbors offered gracious words of welcome. Luhring Augustine’s director, Lauren Wittels concluded: “The attendance was great, with so many neighborhood artists.  The work is fantastic.  The vibe was all positive. We couldn’t be more pleased or proud.”, ",Artist and owner/director of Storefront Bushwick.,"Arts and Culture,Bushwick,Charles Atlas,Chelsea,Deborah Brown,galleries,Happening,Jerry Salz,Luhring Augustine,Marina Abramovic,Roberta Smith","

After months of reconstruction, they have finally finished their gallery space. This really is a huge reason to be excited! When I say a huge reason, I mean exactly 1,500 square feet of a reason!! In other words, the Gallery at The Active Space could easily be the largest gallery in Bushwick….,The floors in the gallery are refurbished hard wood, the space has tall ceilings, and its layout is really interesting. It’s not just a white cube, but one of its longer sides is divided by smaller walls into several open “rooms”, which promises interesting opportunities for installation of art work.

Additionally, there are some storage spaces for rent on the first floor too.,The Active Space is a progressive art center and art studio building located at 566 Johnson Ave in a converted feather factory. The space opened in February 2011 during a popular Bushwick gallery walk, ,. Throughout the year, The Active Space - under the lead of young artist Ashley Zelinskie – rented most of the available studios on the second and third floor and organized several art shows in the space.

In the Hood,"Did you wake up this morning in panic looking at all the art opening invitations wondering ,I personally did, but on the second thought I realized that there everything can be done with a proper planning. That’s why I prepared Weekend Art Map marking down the locations of all the Friday and Saturday art openings in Bushwick and Ridgewood. I hope that this Weekend Art Map will be  a valuable tool when trying to locate and see all the art.,Here is also a small description of art happenings in the area. Good luck!,I am really excited for what is prepared for early Friday night in Ridgewood. The exhibition at Valentine commemorates a film made over 70 years ago on Cornelia Street in Ridgewood. In 2002 artists Jude Tallichet and Matt Freedman bought a building at Cornelia Street and turned it into a studio and living space. While exploring their new property and neighborhood, they discovered the half-degraded film, which documents the efforts of Rabbi Jacob Weiss to build a golem, a supernatural being made of animated clay, to protect his congregation from their anti- Semitic neighbors in the early 1940s.,On Friday, the long awaited and discussed inaugural exhibition of Luhring Augustine is being held in Bushwick. The “gorilla” of the art world originally claimed to had bought only a storage space in Bushwick. However, even Luhring Augustine couldn’t resist the growing hype of Bushwick and its Knickerbocker location will serve as an exhibition space as well. On Friday night, they will present ,, a solo exhibition of the American film and video artist Charles Atlas. I personally want to see it…,It is qiute convenient that the galleries located in the building at 56 Bogart coordinate their openings. You can go once, and see three and more exhibitions at the same time. This is what’s going on there on Friday night;,The Parlour is a brand new gallery located at Bushwick Ave, and Group Show #1 is their very 1st exhibition. If you’re as curious as me, you’ll head there early, because Saturday will be really busy.,Microscope Gallery presents a series of events in connection with the 50th anniversary of Film-Makers’ Cooperative. On Saturday, a legendary filmmaker Ken Jacobs will present some of his early works; as well as and his recent anaglyph 3D video. The event is $6 (Ken Jacobs will be present at the screening).,One of our absolutely favorite new galleries in the area, Small Black Door, is having an opening of a hyper-colorful group show presenting some of the most hip artists in the area (Liz Atzberger, Joe Ballweg, Saira McLaren, Ziad Naccache, Douglas Einar Olsen, Jamie Powell and Eric Sall). A part of the night will belong to a collaborative performance by artists Lydia Ainsworth and Lara Gemmiti.,Legendary loft gallery of Paul D’Agostino will present another of its , exhibitions.

Because this is Bushwick…. Prepared by 950 Hart Gallery, I am positive the night will be fun!

Each week, a different member volunteers to lead a teach-in or skillshare on a topic they have studied. This week’s was led by , , and built upon , discussion of Gentrification. She brought in the book “Urban Fortunes” by John R. Logan and Harvey L. Molotch and we each took a turn reading a paragraph and then discussing what was read with the group. ,.,Following that discussion, I proposed that we go around the room and each talk about our individual reasons for supporting OWS, and what we hope our local group will become. As I’m on vacation most of this week, I don’t have time to recap the whole thing, but the livestream has been archived for review ,.,There is one takeaway from the discussion that I’d like to write about briefly, and it came from a friendly interchange between two very different occupiers. The woman who spoke after me in the circle said that she was concerned that OWS wasn’t aligning itself strongly enough on specific issues and wanted to see more tangible accomplishments. There was a lot of agreement in the room to that statement, including from myself. Later in the circle, we came to ,, a self-described longtime activist and anarchist, who addressed this concern directly by reminding all of us that 14-20 total strangers getting together on a regular basis in their community to talk about all the troubling issues facing our country , a tangible accomplishment in and of itself. I couldn’t agree more.,Granted, it’s going to take a lot more than just talking to bring about real change, but we’re still less than 6 months into this movement’s inception. There’s an awful lot of talking that still has to occur before we can hope to act in the interests of the 99%. Local, ongoing General Assemblies like Bushwick’s will be an essential element to any major actions aimed at reforming or reimagining our system.,The next Bushwick General Assembly will be at 7pm at ,.

In the Hood,"How many coffee shops are there in Bushwick? Many! Just look at the , of our Guide. But which place is the best? What makes for the perfect caffein experience? Does atmosphere matter more than the coffee?,I chose seven popular cafes around Bushwick at random and visited each establishment— a different one every day—over the course of a single week. I would order a single espresso (no milk, no sugar—just the way I like it) and whatever else I wanted. And then I would record my experience. I rated each cafe in five categories (espresso taste, price, atmosphere, staff, and overall experience) on 1 to 5; 5 being amazing and 1 being Lana Del Rey terrible.,Keep in mind that these reviews are meant only as an introduction to the various cafes you may not be acquainted with. You are encouraged to try out each one for yourself to see which one is the right fit. Because any one of these cafes is so much better than a life without coffee…,And now chicks and dudes, I give you my reviews, in no particular order:,(941 Willoughby Ave between Myrtle Ave & Charles Pl),espresso ★★★★,
price ★★★★★,
atmosphere ★★★★,
staff ★★★★★,
overall ★★★★★,This place is everything you’d want in a neighborhood cafe. It keeps a revolving collection of art on the walls, has a laid back but lively feel, and has enough room to even hold a few music shows here and there. It’s an eclectic, colorful  space that usually has a good crowd. There’s a big window in the front, letting in a lot of sunlight and speakers near the back (playing The Knife when I was there). So you kind of have to choose between quiet and dark. This is not a loungy cave like some cafes but a place to bring your laptop and get work done or meet for a brainstorming session over lunch. I also love that they have self serve water, an under-appreciated luxury if you ask me. And I do enjoy their menu. It includes a variety of coffee and non-coffee drinks—Bushwick Egg Creams, Bomb Lattes (you’ll have to find out for yourself)—and a wonderful assortment of sammies. I got the Aladdin (tomato, spinach, and avocado with hummus on whole wheat), served up by a remarkably nice staff. And oh yeah, the espresso is excellent; simple with just the right amount of bite.,(1096 Broadway between Dodworth St & Dekalb Ave),espresso ★★,
price ★★★★,
atmosphere ★,
staff ★★,
overall ★★,When I walked into this place, it was completely empty. So needless to say the atmosphere was a bit dull. I wouldn’t expect any half decent cafe to be on this stretch of Broadway anyway (right across from Lone Wolf) so at least it’s trying. But boy does this one need some sprucing up. Tacky scenes of Paris on the walls, a book shelf filled with dull art books from the 90s, and a kitchen in the back room sectioned off by yellow caution tape? On the bright side, It’s definitely unpretentious and there’s no fear of being distracted here. As for the espresso, I may just be projecting here but I found it to be equally uninspired; a little gritty and a little too sharp. But I guess Anthom Cafe would be fine to grab a coffee and a respectable $3 egg and cheese on good bread in your rush to catch the J train. I’m just saying it doesn’t make me want to go to Paris.,(108 Central Ave between Jefferson St & Troutman St),espresso ★★★★,
price ★★★,
atmosphere ★★★,
staff ★★★★★,
overall ★★★ and 1/2★,If you can get a speat near the window, Central Cafe is a nice little spot. It has 3 big lounge chairs and 3 small tables so don’t expect too much space or any out-of-the-way seating. But the staff was on their game and the menu was small but solid, featuring pumpkin and nutella lattes and some tempting sandwiches. The espresso was decent; tangy with just a little aftertaste. It’s cash only and a bit dusty but all in all, a delightful little cafe.,(24 Irving Ave between Jefferson St & Melrose St),espresso ★★★★★,
price ★★★,
atmosphere ★★★★,
staff ★★★★★,
overall ★★★★ and 1/2★,I’d say Cafe Ghia is the most grown up and sophisticated place on the list. It’s a great spot to come for brunch on a weekend or sit at the bar and have a glass of wine in the evening. I came in for an espresso, sat at the bar where the New York Times was waiting for me, and was waited on like I was important or something. The staff here is ridiculously nice and accommodating and the espresso is stellar; bright, airy, and smooth. The Chalkboards on the wall inform you of the continually changing but always enticing menu. It’s quite refined (especially for Bushwick) and a little more expensive but not outlandishly so. Go to this place.,(1087 Flushing Ave between Knickerbocker Ave & Porter Ave),espresso ★★★★,
price ★★★★,
atmosphere ★★★★,
staff ★★★★,
overall ★★★★,When I first walked into Kavé, I was a bit confused by the decor. The palm plants and large wicker chairs covered in leather make me think of a tropical island. But the color scheme is decidedly brown and the cast iron gate that serves as the front door sheds no light on the situation. Those chairs though are surprisingly comfortable and the vibe here is relaxed and welcoming. It’s probably the largest cafe on the list, especially counting the courtyard I look forward to enjoying when the weather warms up. There’s an abundance of small tables to sit at with your laptop or a book. I also noticed they have a piano, a chess board, and Scrabble on hand. The espresso was fierce and delicious. The rest of the menu includes pumpkin lattes, Italian sodas, a variety of nutmilks, and a good selection of sandwiches and pastries. They also have a fairly awesome antique cash register. A great place to spend the day undisturbed.,(247 Varet St between White St & Bogart St),espresso ★★★★,
price ★★★★,
atmosphere ★★★★,
staff ★★★,
overall ★★★★,I want to like Cafe Orwell because everything is black. It is dark which is awesome but it is loud sometimes which is not necessarily awesome but it has Sessions Lager which is awesome. Being near Bogart and right next door to the Loft Hostel though, it can be tough to get a table to yourself. Too many large, communal tables if you ask me. But the espresso here is robust and flavorful. They have a good variety of sandwiches, salads, bagels, and biscotti. And even bike parking out front. It has some great old chandeliers too, a half piano, and usually a good, eccentric crowd.,(30 Wyckoff Ave @ wait for it… Starr!),espresso ★★★★★,
price ★★★★,
atmosphere ★★★,
staff ★★★★,
overall ★★★★ and 1/2★,Located directly beside the beloved Hana Foods, Wyckoff Starr is probably the smallest cafe on the list. But also probably the best place to people-watch. The menu features sandwiches from Cafe Ghia (the owners of both places overlap) and drinks like The Grasshopper (iced mint mocha) and the Bees Knees (honey latte). The espresso really hits the spot though with a roasty flavor and a perky finish. To get a seat at one of the tables here is a miracle but I usually take my coffee to go and sit on one of the benches outside or hop right onto the L train. This is a busy cafe but the staff is quick, kind, and on the ball. And if you’re from out of town, be sure to mark your spot on their impressive “Where In The World Are You From?” map.,Admittedly, there are many more cafes in Bushwick and “East Williamsburg” that I didn’t get to. I’m sorry if your neighborhood caffeine provider didn’t make the list. If you’d like me to keep going (or cease and desist at once), just leave a comment.,Happy sipping!","Chris is a professional designer, organizer and list-maker.","Bushwick,cafe,coffee,espresso,Happening,review","

People,"It’s kind of hard to sit back and then remember what it’s like being a kid. Not your “childhood,” but being “a kid” specifically. A friend slaps a bracelet on your wrist that immediately curls up. Your brother yells that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon is on, but your sister is occupying the TV watching 90210. You conquer your Super Mario Brothers on Nintendo as you sit among metallic Pogs and trippy Lisa Frank folders, snacking on War Heads and Fruit Roll-Ups. All the while a toy is beeping somewhere in your closet (you assume it’s the Tamagotchi you have been neglecting.),Ken Kosces’ work chooses to remain in this world. His work and living space could easily be confused with a little kid’s bedroom, and this is something he would probably take as a compliment. Ken is one of the artists in ,and you can check out his art at ,.,It’s hard to take a step without getting a pom-pom, a googly eye, or a pixilated cut-out of 1990s era icon stuck to your foot. Bursts of color seem to mask every surface of the space, and while it at first seems like child’s play, something deeper begins to resonate. Something starts to churn up in your mind, you seem to be brought back to a different time.,His pieces are colorful, explosive and a bit chaotic. In his collages, paper is layered upon paper. Distorted yet recognizable images of video game landscapes, pixelated guitars, furbies, sports stars like Magic Johnson and TV stars like Brenda from , cover each other up, fighting for your eyes’ attention, and your mind’s memory on the neon poster board. Some collages are a mix, with a painted background or a drawing in the background, layered with paper, googly eyes, pom poms and cut-outs.,“You go to art school, they try and hit you with all these classical ways of doing art, the history of art and these academic ways of learning how to draw and paint,” explained Ken. “But you actually forget the things you do when you’re growing up before you get to a university, and I kind of realized lately there’s something messed up about that.”,While Ken explained this method to me, he shuffled through different shapes of paper cut-outs and video game music that he had created, and plans to incorporate into his work, played in the background. “It’s like reconnecting with things outside of like formal training and embracing like, stupid materials arts and crafts and kids materials.” He begins to toss the cut-outs down onto a painting, letting them fall and land where they please, then rearranging them so slightly.,“I’m a painter when it’s all said and done, an abstract painter. The difference is I’m not using paint in the way they did in the ’50s. I’m trying to use these pieces of things.” He throws down the first “piece of paint,” an image Shaquille O’Neal which lands sideways on the canvas. Another makes a “dat” noise as the cut-out hits the posterboard. This time it’s Chris Mullin, followed by Dennis Rodman and Charles Barkley, until a mini basketball team artfully presents itself. He begins to fuss with the pieces.,“I accumulated this as a consumer, as someone invested in pop culture and all the stupidity that that comes from. But now that I have them I’m transforming it to something else and as the formal training of an artist goes and the formal eye of the artist to make this the most interesting way,” Ken explained very matter-of-factly.,I found his use of the word “stupid” which he used throughout the interview very interesting. He described many of the materials as stupid, as well as a lot of things referencing pop culture. But I think he means it in the way that pop culture, however low brow or “stupid” it can be, has a great power. At this point, I asked Ken about something that I observe happen often among museum goers that may not be so into the arts. What if when people see his work, they become intimidated or confused? If they don’t find the immediate answer in his pieces that they are so used to getting, they might use the “a five year old could do that” defense. Those dreaded words I often hear when someone seems intimidated by abstract art. “A 5-year-old can do it? Well turn it on its head and do it like a 5-year-old. That’s my response. It challenges high art, it challenges museum art and popular culture and the perceptions of art.”,Ken’s medium is not paper, not googly eyes, not glue or paint - it’s pop culture from his generation. Pop culture, as “stupid” as it may be, has the power to reach and identify with millions of people all over the globe. It can form groups and commonalities across races, genders and classes and even amongst those who don’t speak the same language. It has the power to make waves, fight for change and say things and have them heard.,“I’m just trying to make something beautiful when it comes down to it,” Ken said, “and it’s unapologetic in its nostalgia.” I wouldn’t call that stupid at all.","On a mission to expose the NYC art scene for what it is - fun, inspiring and exciting!

In the Hood,"One of the Bushwick’s newest mysteries , is nestled into what looks like a converted garage on Troutman street. The space houses all sorts of activities, acting as a yoga center, art space, performance venue, community kitchen, and more. All activities are aimed at bettering the self and learning while doing so. Basically, it’s one of the most open-ended DIY spaces in Brooklyn. They host yoga twice daily throughout the week and also have an excellent Cosmic Yoga session every Sunday evening. I joined them for their last cosmic yoga session before they closed to undergo some renovations.,Our class was lead by Amy, whom you may have seen somewhere around Bushwick with her huge smile and carefree attitude. She’s teaches a mellow Vinyasa yoga class with Kundalini breathing elements. It’s a very personal experience to do yoga in the quiet, dark, and chilly studio, where no one cares or even notices how long you can hold a shoulder stand. During cosmic yoga the experience is even more special- the session features live music! Last week a cellist played slow, beautiful, theraputic songs that really made the practice more sensory and enveloping. The cathartic class lasted about an hour and a half, featured very personal direction, and cost a mere ten dollars.,After the class finished a crowed of others arrived to enjoy the raw vegan meal that followed. A few cooks crowded the small kitchen and served thai-themed goods they had prepared for the occassion. The meal was beautiful! Big thanks to Nick, one of the chefs who prepared the feast, who sent me over a list of ingredients and items!

In the Hood,"As more OWS supporters started to come out of winter/holiday hibernation, I decided I wanted to start focusing on connecting at a local level. The events I participated in during the end of 2011 were all “standalone” and I was looking to find a group I could meet with regularly and help create something more cohesive and sustainable. After some Googling, I found ,, started chatting with a few other members, and we decided to get together.,About six of us, counting my fiance Deb and myself, ended up meeting at , on Wednesday 1/25. We had an open conversation about our backgrounds, core issues, and what we are looking to accomplish through OWS. The consensus was to meet again the following Wednesday and to try and keep GAs going on a regular basis. We knew that it would be inappropriate to set any formal agenda with so few people, so we left that open and just focused on spreading the word. The goal at this point would simply be to bring in more people and listen. We also agreed that it would be good to have one person give a half-hour skill-share or teach-in at each week’s meeting. I volunteered to do the first one, focused on helping people to consume and contribute to the digital conversation more efficiently and effectively.,At 7pm on 2/1, the following Wednesday, my family and I arrived at Kave, taped one of our “OCCUPY BUSHWICK” flyers to a table, and waited for people to arrive. Within ten minutes, the cafe was filled with Occupiers, most of whom I had never met before. Since that night was unusually warm, we opted to take the gathering out into the courtyard behind the coffee shop. I setup two laptops, one for live streaming and another for demonstration purposes, and I commenced my skill-share.  I primarily focused on social networking, micro-blogging, and leveraging the tools on occupybk.org. I emphasized that all of these are most effective when they are supported by offline interactions such as meetings like these. I wrapped up my talk going over an , I designed with a basic primer on HTML tags and useful links for participating in OWS digitally.,I wasn’t able to watch or participate in the about 90% of the actual General Assembly, as my eleven month old son decided he wanted to practice saying “Yayayah! YahaahYahYa!”, nonstop, for about two whole hours. Luckily, Deb was recording the whole event as we simultaneously live-streamed to about 12-20 viewers. So I spent the better part of last night watching the tape a few minutes at a time and summarizing each person’s contribution to the discussion.

Every inch of the space is covered in the duo’s very recognizable style. The big block wood and/or cement cut outs that spell thinks like “skew” “NYC” “Hype” and “power” among many other things commanded the space, marking it as their own.,Marking territory is a practice Skewville is very familiar with.  One piece in the show is a lawn mower designed to mow the words “Keep On the Grass.” And more famously, strewn about the space is Skewville’s “When Dogs Fly” pieces. Ever see sneakers strung up over telephone lines in the city? Skewville has been practicing this ritual since they were children, and look at it as a way of making their mark in a place. “When Dogs Fly” refers to the busted shoes that adorn your tired achy feet, or “dogs”. Each sneaker is painted on wood, and then can be cut out and strung up over telephone lines. Skewville has been peddling this practice all around the country, customizing certain dogs to certain places, and leaving their mark on the wires.,This show is like entering Willy Wonka’s factory, but instead of imaginative versions of  sweets we have that of street culture. There are recognizable bright images and objects everywhere, cement blocks, fire hydrants, dice, traffic barriers, and yet they are all “wonkafied,” or Skewvillified into a dream land of cartoon-like and stylized pieces to reflect the impression this team has left on their city.","On a mission to expose the NYC art scene for what it is - fun, inspiring and exciting!

In the Hood,"Since I’ve been invited to post here on an ongoing basis, I figured I’d introduce myself to the readership before I post my first official report on local Occupation events. I am not an impartial observer, as the Occupy Wall Street movement is very personal to me. I feel that it is important to tell the story of my journey within OWS so far, if for no other reason than to encourage other Occupiers to share their own.,I moved to Bushwick in January of 2011 with my pregnant girlfriend, Deb. We met at ,, enjoying the night lives of amateur ,/,. We fell for each other pretty hard, pretty quick. Both of us are computer professionals, I do web design, she does video editing. At the end of February 2011, our son Dominic Oscar Douglas was born (named for my grandfather and the fact that he was born on Oscar night). As anyone will tell you, having a child changes the way you look at the world: it extends your view of the future. I was lucky to have concluded a big freelance gig just before his birth, which allowed me to stay at home for his first two months and just , with him and Deb fully. I loved it. It was the first break I’d given myself from following politics in quite a long time. I got by working from home until July, when I landed a full-time job animating banner ads for a major bank (oh, life).,I have always occupied my down time reading the news and blogs (especially ,, whom I have been reading daily since 2005), but rarely engaged in any actual activism apart from trying to support the Howard Dean campaign in 2003.,
We all remember how that panned out, right?,The issues that worried me during the Bush years have only gotten worse: corporate control of government oversight and legislation, the growing acceptance of the idea of a “unitary” executive branch that can act in secret with no judicial review, indefinite detention, and worst of all, the escalation of the wars on drugs and “terror”. I voted for Obama because he said all the right things regarding these issues during the 2008 campaign, but his actions have since nullified the power of his words for me. Having a child now, I have momentary bouts of depression about the world he’s likely to live in if these issues are not addressed. Suffice to say, I was pretty cynical and fatalistic about the political landscape before the Occupation began.,I first became aware of OWS when a , I’m friends with posted a video of himself performing at Zuccotti on Facebook. It wasn’t long after that I recognized this movement’s significance in the way it “activated” so many friends who were typically apolitical or totally cynical. I saw them participating in early marches, most significantly the Brooklyn Bridge. The significance of that  mass arrest in galvanizing these early supporters cannot be understated. After seeing all this play out on Facebook and Twitter for a week, I started to spend whatever time I could in Zuccotti after work and on weekends, knowing that it wouldn’t last for very long. Most of the time I would just hang out and watch, maybe have a quick conversation with the person by my side. Before long, I would go down on my lunch break and hold up this sign:,I was immediately captivated by the possibilities of consensus-focused democracy using the General Assembly process, and fell in love with the tools of the Occupation such as audience feedback, orderly discussions, and of course the human mic. About a week after being exposed to the last tool I realized it would be a beautiful way to propose to Deb (good mic checks read like poetry, btw). So I went to a flea market to up-cycle a ring from a local merchant, wrote out some words, and emailed some friends a time & place to meet. I told her we were gonna hang out and play music. Here’s what happened instead:,As I uploaded the video, I was certain that everyone we were friends with on facebook would love it and be happy for us. I didn’t expect to be on , by 3pm the next day and at 100k views two weeks later. The experience galvanized our support for the movement, and reading through the YouTube comments as the video spread, I really internalized the uphill battle we face in terms of challenging the assumptions of people supporting OWS. We have since used every media inquiry into our story as an opportunity to articulate specifically why we are supporting this movement, a topic that would take up much more space than this introductory post should be.,Soon after the proposal Deb and I started working with ,, which we became aware through the , they organized (that same night, a lunatic decided to ,). Through most of the winter, POWS was my primary focus. I formed a real bond with the original organizer and a core group of other parents around NYC that I’ve continued to kept in touch. We’ve organized some small events such as a Children’s GA and march against the “bullies” in the NYPD.,The second video faced a similar barrage of baseless attacks in the comments, which I addressed at the ,‘s Wednesday open mic.,And that pretty much brings us up to date with my involvement in the Occupation up the first Occupy Bushwick General Assembly of 2012. Check back in the next day or two for my first report on the ,.,I believe this movement must make every effort to be as transparent as possible in order to juxtapose itself with the secrecy-obsessed government we are trying to reform. I support this movement without any shred anonymity, despite the risks it could pose to myself and my family. I could very well lose my job animating Flash advertisements for a major bank and the medical benefits that come with it if the wrong people at my company learn of my involvement in OWS. Many other supporters face the same dilemma, in much more precarious positions than mine.,Finally, it should be understood that the opinions and observations I am writing here are mine and in no way influenced by any collective agreement with the people I’m covering. Hopefully everyone who attends the events that I cover will read these articles and feel free to correct the record in the comments if they ever feel I have misrepresented them.","Brian , on computers and , on stage.","#ows,General Assembly,Happening,Kave,Occupy Bushwick,The Loom","

People,". The names of the paintings by , document the journey you undertake when you take a dive into his work. References to the video games, encounters with aliens, rad 1990s TV shows, Native American motives… The visual language of Matthew Mahler is peculiarly odd, magical, and fascinating. Yet his works feel so familiar to someone who grew up in the ’90s, and was surrounded by the same pop culture and the common objects of fascination. Matthew Mahler says that it took him a long time to figure out how to create art that represents what he knows the best. He talks about his MFA break as the time when he was able to fully focus on his work and make a lot of progress in finding himself.,Matt has been a vital part of the Bushwick arts community. Last year, he and his buddy artist Jonathan Terranova opened a gallery located in the basement of a Ridgewood building. They named it , after, well, its small black door. They have been putting up amazingly refreshing group art shows focusing on underrepresented artists from the Bushwick area.,Matthew is also one of the artists in , which is the second exhibition of the internet-based gallery ,. You can catch up with him at the offline opening of the show this Friday at ,.,I caught Matt in his studio in the industrial part of Greenpoint. He was just about to start working  on a drawing. He was using a ruler and wide markers. “There is something wrong about using markers for fine art. That’s why I like it,” Matthew was laughing. We chatted about Small Black Door, his MFA experience and the role of the 1990s in his work…,I am curating a show there in April, and my work may be part of it. It won’t be “The Matthew Mahler Show,” though.  It will be a group show, and I feel like it makes sense to include my work., ,It can be done, but has to be done in a tasteful way… I don’t like when somebody curates a show, put themselves in it, and then they even use their own image for the postcard…. By the way, would you like some water? I only have these shot-sized cups…,[We do shots of water.],The impact of the 1990s in my work is pretty overt. Having grown up in that time; meaning literally becoming a mature person,  I can’t help but include that experience. I don’t mean in a nostalgic or comforting way, but the 1990s are what I know. I have always made work based on my experience, and I can’t deny that I grew up as part of that generation with a certain visual language. I think that’s why I am so drawn to using it and adopting it as my visual language.,Before I could get where I’m now I had to learn a lot of things the hard way. Before I could innovate, I had to imitate. It sounds cliché, but I literary had to practice making somebody else’s artwork before I figured out what it was that I wanted to make. I had to figure out whom it was I wanted to make artwork for. I feel like many people make their work for specific audience that has been around for a long time. It makes sense, because people who are 50-60 years old are of the demographics that is most likely to buy work. They feel comfortable with things that look certain way…I don’t want to be misunderstood that I make work to sell. That’s obviously not what this is about; my work is about feeling that I’m alive.  Making art makes me feel like I am here and I contribute in some weird way…,But I definitely think about who I make my art for; who is my audience. I believe I make work for my peers. I don’t know if I could make work for people who are 30 years older than me, because I wouldn’t be as familiar with their visual language as I am with my own generation.,You go from being a part of one community that is very protective, to another. Grad school provides you with a community where you are sheltered from the outside world in many ways. Then all of the sudden you’re put out there in the real world.  It’s shocking and exciting, all at once. I’m very happy to be out of grad school.,I think that the Bushwick arts community is very welcoming and inspiring. Just the fact that there is a place like Bushwick where there is room for everyone! Maybe because it’s still kind of on the young side…But during my first five years in New York, I never really felt like I belong anywhere, and now for the first time I feel like I can participate. I feel comfortable with what I’m doing in Bushwick., and I don’t have to play with a specific crowd…,I had the opportunity, and I felt like I had to take it.  When the opportunity presents itself, at any point in your life, but specifically in New York where opportunities come and go in different frequencies, you should take it… Also I know so many great artists who don’t get their opportunity to show, and we wanted to put these people out there. Our openings are like parties for everybody. It’s a celebration of the people that participate in the show, and of people who come to see the work.,I don’t think so. I think that Ridgewood will always be a really beautiful cousin of Bushwick, and I think that Ridgewood will be pretty content with that. I think it’s a pretty special place, because it allows those who live and work there to be involved in with what’s going on in Bushwick. But also still be in distance from it so that we can do our own thing. I think Ridgewood is really cool…","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

While we were talking, Phoebe, a wine enthusiast and a bartender at Miles, came in and told me all about their stellar wine selection, and the process of wine curating.

If you want to put a term on it, it’s happening everywhere in New York, not just here.,My vision for the place has always been to create a comfortable beer and wine bar;  the kind of place where you just want to hang out, and be able to have a conversation.,Also a date place, yes. It’s not a rowdy bar. But first and foremost it’s beer and wine bar, which is reflected in our beer list and in our wine menu. The idea was also that it was a beer and wine bar that served really good bar food.,[She laughs.] I have worked in wine since I was 19, before I was even legally allowed to drink it, and I love it so much! My roots are definitely in Italian wine. I have worked in this neighborhood for a little over four years now. That’s how I know these guys; just from having bartended at several other places in the neighborhood. I really enjoy wine, and I am really proud of the wine list we have created here. About half of our wines are either biodynamic or organic and sustainable. Trying the wines we have here now feels like we did such a good job! There isn’t a single dud on the menu!,Danny: Oh, yeah, it was fun! We worked with distributors who set up tastings with us here before we opened. We had several Wednesday nights when we were a little drunk [he laughs]. It was a very fun process. Very exciting too!,Phoebe: One of the distributors we wanted to work with was Savio Soares, who deals primarily in biodynamic and organic sustainable wines. Our baby right now is Champs de Cailloux. I think it was the last one we tried on our 1st wine tasting, and we thought it was so fantastic, we immediately committed to a huge order. So far everyone has been gravitating towards that wine. It is really amazing!,Danny: We took the same amount of care in curating the beer menu as well. We wanted to give our guests a nicer beer menu; something better than what you can get at other places in the neighborhood.,Pheobe: We feel like there is this generic beer list that you see in most of the bars, not only in this neighborhood. We wanted more than just average.,Danny: We also carry the whole Sixpoint line, which is sort of a staple in all the Bushwick bars.,Travis: We don’t have any PBRs, Bud Light or Coors…,Danny: We found this place through our friend Shari, who used to be sort of a Bushwick’s real estate guru. She doesn’t do that anymore, but she knows a lot of people and buildings in the neighborhood. She helped us find this place, which used to be quite a run down bodega. When we came here, we had to completely gut the entire space. We did most of the work here ourselves. We did everything from the wallpaper on the ceiling to the bar and the wood back here. We even made the light fixtures.,Danny: We had our hands in everything here. The floor is the original floor of the building, which is nearly 100 years old. I also have a really cool photo of this building from the 1930s…,Danny: What makes Bushwick home for us is the community…The people we have grown to consider family.,Travis: And camaraderie too. Everyone is really willing to help out. Other business owners have been really great and helpful.  There isn’t a lot of competition going on. Everybody shares the information.,Pheobe: That’s actually very evident in just the staff we have right now. All of our bartenders have two jobs in this neighborhood. I work at Café Ghia and some other bartenders work at Tandem. And it’s not a conflict of interest. It’s like a family.,Danny: Yes, I feel like all the business owners here are like a little family, which is nice.,I am an architect. I have a master degree in architecture. I worked in architecture for about 10 years before I went more freelance for the past 3 years, but it got to a point when….,Yeah, I was in art school, 18 years old, and I remember telling my parents that I just want to get an art degree and open up a hotel or a restaurant. I just wanted to walk around and take photographs and make art. My parents thought I was crazy and they pushed me to get a “real” career, so I just picked the most creative profession I could find, architecture, and immersed myself in that. However, the corporate world wasn’t really for me… It was something that I wasn’t ever really happy doing. Then once I found myself in Bushwick and I really didn’t see myself leaving anytime soon, I decided it was time to pursue this dream….,Congratulations to you!","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

Beauty Bar Bushwick opened in , as a rougher little brother of Beauty Bar on East 14th Street, where you could have a drink and some beautification procedure done at the same time.  , is a chain of bars all around the country with locations in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, Denver, Chicago, Portland, Austin and Las Vegas. However, over the years, the owner Paul Devitt realized that Bushwick isn’t as good of a location as he expected. “The area was not developing as fast as we had hoped,” said Beauty Bar owner Paul Devitt for ,. “A lot of kids in Bushwick are strapped financially. They drink at home, at parties.” In Park Slope, Devitt is expecting a hipster clientele who has gotten married, had a baby, but still wants to be stimulated.,Oh well, we all got wasted at Beauty Bar at least once in our lifetime, but it’s true that the place hasn’t been exactly crowded lately.

,“Hipster brunch is a late, low fi version of brunch in East Williamsburg,” said the ironic invitation from Rob de Oude from ,. Last weekend was the final weekend for their current exhibition , (and Matthew Mahler and Andrew Zarou in the Project Space), and actually the final exhibition weekend for Camel Art Space as well. Indeed, Camel Art Space is moving from their current location on 722 Metropolitan to 1717 Troutman in Bushwick. I stopped by to check out the , art at Camel, and to chat with Rob de Oude and Enrico Gomez about their upcoming move.,One of the reasons for the move is that many galleries left the area and Camel became sort of an isolated animal in East Williamsburg. However, the main reason for the move is of practical nature. The building on Metropolitan Ave has become increasingly unstable. Leaks and other unsafe conditions are not the best spaces to store and exhibit art…That’s why Rob and his fellows from Camel didn’t hesitate to sign the lease at 1717 Troutman. Unlike other art spaces who are coming to Bushwick because of the increasing hype of the place in the art world, for Camel the move to Bushwick is more than natural. Not only does the space have more of a Bushwick than Williamsburg vibe, but Rob has lived in Bushwick for over six years and is actually happy that he can walk to his studio after several years of L train trouble.,Camel is not only moving their gallery but also their art studios. Rob said that the new space will be smaller, but they are welcoming the decrease of space as they want to focus on smaller and solo person art shows for the future, and get deeper into curation. They also want to exhibit more of their own work, as Camel Art Space was focusing mostly on big group shows and guest curators. Camel Art Space will be losing its name and is also leaving their mascot, the wood camel, behind. The camel came with the building, and no one would refer to the building differently as a result. The artists haven’t decided on the new name yet, and to my tiny disappointment, they ruled out animals from the selection [*sigh*]. The new space will be ready for the 1st show in April. We can’t wait!,Camel Art Space has been operating on Metroplolitan Ave since 2008, though Rob de Oude has been renting his studio in the building for at least 10 years.  Camel Art Space started as a collective of artists who had studios in the building, and who were aspiring to curate group shows and to show their own work in the gallery space.  Rob said that the decision to use the space at 722 Metropolitan as a gallery followed the recession peak of 2008, after which many galleries in Williamsburg had to close down. He felt like Camel has the necessary space and enthusiasm to fill in the sudden gap, and has been doing a great job since.,Welcome to Bushwick*, guys!","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

Here is how you can get involved in Bushwick community:, is a community organization dedicated to the enrichment and preservation of Bushwick. It is a part of the Occupy Brooklyn movement, and if you caught yourself fretting about the recent development of Bushwick using the “G” word at least 5 times in the past 3 days, we suggest you come to , in The Loom on Wednesday, and actually talk about what you can do to create socially sustainable environment in Bushwick.,To accompany the #ows movement, ,is hosting an interesting film series, which focuses on ’80s-90s cautionary tales: movies from the margin, standing in the long shadow of Reagan and Thatcher. Their common vision is that of everyday life tortured into goose-step with an expensive and sophisticated police state and cheap and vulgar consumer goods. Alternating between B-movie blockbusters and indies, the worlds of REPO MAN and ROBOCOP, the films expose possible results of the dysfunctional relationship between a people and their government., is a quarterly printed publication that features short stories, essays, poetry, photography, recipes, paintings, drawings, plays, comics, and basically anything that can be printed on a black-and-white page. It is also a growing community of creative people. On Saturday, Bushwick Review will bring readings of 11 writers. Also check out new yoga spot in the neighborhood, Body Actualized.,Many know Paul D’Agostino as a Bushwick pioneer who opened ,, a gallery at his loft at Moore St. Many know Paul as a highly sophisticated curator and the community supporter. Many know Paul as a professor of Italian language and literature at Brooklyn College, and many know Paul as a contributor to ,.

Music,"are a trio you should get to know by ,. They’ve gathered a light buzz around Brooklyn, one of the members hailing from Bushwick, and having shared bills with groups such as ,. For this young, refreshing band there’s nowhere to go but up, having already released their debut 8-song LP, , and playing at ,, where I caught them last week.,Listen to and download “Under the Whale,” the 3rd track off Beach Arab’s , EP here:,The first genre that comes to mind when listening to their music is punk, but they create such a blend of different influences that it’s hard to label them as a strictly punk or rock band. They experiment with their sound- different songs follow varying moods- incorporating surf, garage, experimental, grunge and jazz influences. The most obvious thing about their music is that they aren’t playing around. Despite playful jamming and scattered percussion that seem to segment their music, they power through each song with serious intention, riffs picking up on forgotten song elements from earlier on, bringing the listener full circle on each song. Guitarist Liz Hogg plays her electric guitar as the band’s primary voice and melody maker, though when they do incorporate lyrics, they gain a level of relatability which makes them seem more like a 90′s rock band. If they had to be grouped with some influences we might be able to hear, I hear a smashing sample with little bit of Modest Mouse, Yuck, Pavement, Deerhunter… if you added a super-shredder guitar.,Switching gears from hardcore guitar parts to more tropical melodies on songs like (name-track) Beach Arabs, they remind us of just why their sound is so refreshing. There is no doubt in the way they lay out their songs, where a band as new and young as this might find pockets of insecurity, they instead reinforce their unique sound by going even harder.  On “Under the Whale” we are reminded of the band’s punk roots and moody noise elements, then swiftly transformed to a lighter, less demanding listening spot with rhythmic guitar sweeps.  The guitar sound is strong, precise, and powerful, the drums crash emotionally, and the bass bumps around in a very energetic way. To sum it up, The Beach Arabs are unapologetic.  And this is why they are our Bushwick Music Crush. Look out for their second full length album, which they are currently recording to be release in 2012.",strict rule breaker. photographer. music obsessee. brooklynite.,"Bushwick,death by audio,Happening,music,punk,the beach arabs","

Arts and Culture,"A week before Christmas of 1981, a teaching position opened at Roland Hayes Intermediate School 291. Meryl Meisler says she could only imagine what happened to the teacher before her. “Was the other teacher killed?” she asked herself. Another cause of anxiety for Meryl was the New York Blackout that occurred in the summer of 1977, and its disastrous consequences for Bushwick. “After, images of looting and fires in Bushwick were forever burned into my brain,” Meryl says.,Nevertheless, Meryl Meisler accepted the offer and taught in Bushwick from 1981 to 1994, and she says it was never boring. In February 1982, she found the courage to take photos on her way from the subway to school. She used to carry an inexpensive plastic point and shoot pocket camera loaded with cheap transparency film and developed it in the least costly way possible.,30 years later, the neighborhood has made its comeback, and Meryl Meisler’s photographs of Bushwick from the 1980s are invaluable historical material with high aesthetic value added.

We were monitoring the debates both online and offline, and we are bringing you the most interesting points made through out the night.,Hrag lived in Bushwick between 2000 to 2008. He said that if you told someone in 2000 that Bushwick was the next thing, people would just laugh at you…,Carolina, whose big article about Bushwick is coming up in Artnews next week, spent 7 years in the neighborhood. She said that when she arrived, the only way to make connection with other artists was to spot someone with weird hair in a deli. She pointed out that art is an industry. While in 1968 there were 72 MFA programs in the country, today there is over 900… She said that Bushwick is actually the place where the entry level workers of art industry come to live. With the artists, the businesses come, which should be a good thing for the neighborhood, but often new businesses don’t hire locally, which creates tension. Carolina thinks that for people who came to Bushwick before the Blackout, its development is a good thing. They are welcoming a safer environment, new opportunities, etc. For people who came after the Blackout, it’s not so good. She said that whenever the locals see another U-Haul truck, they roll their eyes, because another Blanquito is coming, and the price of their rent, even the chicken in a bodega will go up.,Thomas, who runs Brooklyn Fire proof, rents 185,000 sq feet of property in Bushwick. He has been in the neighborhood for 9 years, and originally opened BK Fireproof as an art gallery in Williamsburg. He used to come to Bushwick to party. He said that there are many people around who don’t want to see Bushwick progress, because what many of us don’t know, Bushwick serves to Manhattan.  For example most of the garbage from Manhattan ends in Bushwick. There are people who don’t want this to change its industrial function.,Deborah Brown came in 2006 for the first time by accident, and 3 weeks later she owned a factory at Stockholm Street. Her intuition told her that Bushwick will be happening soon. Deborah said that she had witnessed big changes throughout the years, but the biggest changes have occurred within the last 6 months. Deborah thinks that 56 Bogart building is a manifestation of the art community, and that you can do anything in Bushwick. She co-founded a gallery, and is a member of the Community Board. Also, at the Community Board you get a completely different outlook on Bushwick; you get to learn who the leaders of the community are, you meet families, etc.,Deborah said that she has heard virtually nothing on the Community Board about the art community for years, and she has been the only one there and on her block, of her race and age…except for the last 6 months. Hers was a voice expressing anxiety and fear of the change. She said that it was the number of people coming recently to this neighborhood that triggered this anxiety.,Deborah said that the demographic composition of Bushwick is a lot more complicated that people think. There are many people of Latin descendant, but also many undocumented new immigrants.,Marco Antonini has never lived in Bushwick. Ironically when NURTUREart moved to Bushwick recently, he wanted to move here too to be closer to work, but he couldn’t find a place that he could afford. He lives in Clinton Hill.,He said that arts have always been a major factor of gentrification, and you can’t stop city from expanding. He, as the only European on the panel, said that what is being referred to as “community” is simply a class that differs by education, race and wealth.,Hrag makes a point that many galleries that moved from Williamsburg back to Manhattan did so because of the L train and its frequent repairs. The question is how much the L train influences Bushwick. We saw during Bushwick Open Studios 2011 when the L train was not running, that its impact could be significant. Other panelists seemed to agree with Hrag, and everyone was wondering what the hell MTA is always repairing there. “They could have had another tube by now,” Thomas said.,Deborah said that there are new galleries arriving in Bushwick that certainly want to do business. Like Stephanie Theodor, a gallery that is about to open at 56 Bogart.,Carolina thinks that Bushwick is a little in love with itself, because apartment art shows are something that has always happened in the beginning of a scene. However, this commercial wave can have a “parachute effect,” meaning that the art collectors from Luhring Augustine will go to the gallery, eat at Roberta’s afterwards and go back to Manhattan.,Hrag points out that this scene is more self-conscious.,Marco makes an interesting point that the critical mass in Bushwick is very self-sufficient, DYI. He sees the future in smaller commercial ventures. He thinks Bushwick has a pragmatic scene that will make sure to survive.,Hrag points out that this self-sufficiency might be also caused by the cuts in funding of arts, and that the artists had to learn how to be self-sufficient.,Thomas says that he sees a trend in Bushwick where the most of the artists realize that they probably won’t become world’s most famous painters. Instead they become mini-manufacturers with 1 or 2 employees creating their product, living a creative life. He says that every closed door in Bushwick is hiding something exciting happening. He sees a very entrepreneurial spirit in Bushwick.,Marco thinks we definitely are not, but that’s a problem with funding for arts everywhere in the world. However, it’s not automatic in other countries that artists have this entrepreneurial spirit, and that’s why the lack of support is sad.,Deborah thinks that because we vote, we can influence the allocation of funds.,Carolina says that it’s not easy to be creative when the housing prices are astronomical. That’s something that the Bloomberg administrative didn’t address very well…,Also there are huge poverty issues going on in Bushwick outside of the art world, that are more urgent and require attention.,Thomas expresses his frustration with the city. His businesses are always getting huge, unreasonable fines from inspectors. (“A fruit fly, $300.”) He says that the inspectors are squeezing money out of little businesses, and taxes are being raised even during the worst recession.","On a mission to expose the NYC art scene for what it is - fun, inspiring and exciting!

Food and Drink,"Just right. That’s how the bar at the corner of Wilson Ave and George St feels. , is a bar with no other ambition than to be your neighborhood bar where you go after work and chill. It has a rather conservative interior and the bar is made of hard wood. A large mirror above the bar makes the tiny place look optically bigger than it actually is. Whiskey bottles are nicely lined up, windows face the street, and an old fashioned juke box plays your favorite song. Every little object has a story and was carefully chosen by the husband and wife duo of the owners- Stevie Cain and Aaron Augenblick. Stevie has been a bartender for 17 years and Aaron has an animation studio in Dumbo. More than 6 months ago they made their year long dream come true and they opened a bar in Bushwick.,I stopped by at Cain’s Tavern to chat with the owners, curious about the history of the space, the ups and downs of running a business in Bushwick, and their vision….,Stevie: Yes, I am here at the daytime. I also bartend, but we have staff. We open at 3:30pm. I manage the day to day operation and have to be here anyway, so I might as well open the gates early.,Aaron: Stevie has been a bartender forever. Since we met, basically.,Stevie: 17 years in New York.,Aaron: This is definitely her world. She knows everything!,Stevie: Yeah… But you can never stop learning. You can never stop trying to get better. I have always wanted to do this, and I was finally ready also monetarily, because we did this all on our own. We don’t have partners; we didn’t take loans.,Aaron: We saved up money until the point when we were like: we can do this!,[quote]We used to live in the Lower East Side in the early ’90s, and Bushwick reminds us of that era. Bushwick has a lot of heart.[/quote],Aaron: We live in Fort Green, but we wanted to do this in Bushwick for a couple of reasons. We live nearby, and we would come over sometimes, and this place has such a great vibe.,Stevie: We used to live in the Lower East Side in the early ’90s, and Bushwick reminds us of that era. Bushwick has a lot of heart.,Aaron: It used to be really cool at the Lower East Side. Everyone was an artist or a musician. There was no pretention. It’s not like that anymore.,Stevie: Baby, it’s also 20 years later. We’re not 17 anymore [they are both laughing].,But it was also a good decision, because this neighborhood is going to blow up, and I want to be here when it happens. I want to have my roots here already. I want to be one of the first. Plus we have a lot of friends around.,Aaron: Yes, the people are really good, really creative…,Stevie: We also like other establishments in the area; we like that everyone is kinda doing their own thing. There is no competition. There is sense of community, which is really really important to me, because that’s the way I work. I don’t compete with people, I share…,[quote]This used to be a Puerto Rican speakeasy, a jazz club. And I’ve heard a rumour that it was owned by Tito Puente!![/quote],Aaron: It was a bodega before us. The bodega was pretty nasty. We had to completely cut it and start from scratch. I’ve talked to some of the local old-timers here, people that grew up here, and apparently a long time ago, this used to be a Puerto Rican speakeasy, a jazz club.  And I’ve heard a rumour that it was owned by Tito Puente!!,Stevie: When we pulled out this wall [she points at the wall behind the bar], there was a huge hand drawn map of Puerto Rico. It perhaps could have stayed, had the wall been structurally sound…. But we had to tear it down.,Aaron: The map was hand drawn using magic markers. There were palm trees and bikini girls…. It was pretty awesome.,Stevie: I couldn’t be more grateful for our customers and humble how much everyone has been good to us. Because when you’re coming to the new neighborhood you never know how people will receive you. You are betting on a fact that the people will like the same thing you like, which is a really raw thing.  You know, I’m a private person in a sense that I’m not up to be a billionaire, I’m not up to own a thousand bars, I don’t want to own a 2-storey club. I will die in this space… This is my baby… [they are both laughing…] My point is that I set out to create a neighborhood bar…. I just want people to come in, hang out, talk to other people, drink whiskey and listen to music. I just want them to be comfortable, and that’ it…,Aaron: Our goal was from the start to have…,Stevie and Aaron together [and we didn’t rehearse this , ]: …. a neighborhood bar.,Aaron: We didn’t try to create a large drink menu. We wanted to create a drinker’s bar. That’s what’s great about Bushwick- all the bars have their own vibe…,Stevie: The weekends are good, weeknights are really good too because most of the people that come here live around here. A ton of our customers live right up George Street.,Aaron: The weeknights are our locals’ nights.,Stevie: No matter what, anytime you walk in here, you will know somebody, if not the person behind the bar… You’ll always have a pleasant experience…,[mappress mapid=""7""]","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

In the Hood,"“Everything in Bushwick will change after this talk,” said Peter Hopkins regarding the talk , that is being hosted at ,. Peter Hopkins is the co-owner of one of the new galleries in Bushwick, The Bogart Salon, and additionally he curates the building at 56 Bogart. In case you haven’t heard yet, the huge yellow building across the street from the Morgan subway entrance, 56 Bogart is currently home to seven galleries, including two big art non-profits, Momenta Art and NURTUREart. Additionally,  more galleries are expected to move in pretty soon, including a Bushwick branch of a SoHo gallery, ,.,56 Bogart is something like a gallery mall, or a gallery arcade as Peter Hopkins likes to say. Its presence in Bushwick is bitter sweet. On one hand, it’s awesome that seven galleries can coordinate their openings and attract more people to come. On the other hand, it’s changing the game in Bushwick where most of the “old” galleries were DYI, artist run spaces, working mostly on a non-commercial basis. 56 Bogart attracts commercial gallerists from around the city. Also let’s not forget about Luhring Augustine, big fancy gallery from Chelsea, who are having their first opening in Bushwick on February 17 few blocks away., aspires to cover all these topics and more. The panel is hosted by Hrag Vartanian, editor of Hyperallergic. Other panelists are Deborah Brown, artist and owner of Storefront Bushwick gallery, Thomas Burr Dodd, artist, owner and founder of Brooklyn Fire Proof; Carolina A. Miranda, art critic and culture writer for WNYC and Artnews; and Marco Antonini, Director of NURTUREart.,The question is whether the panel is diverse enough to speak for the entire art scene in Bushwick. Several people pointed out that the panel doesn’t contain anyone from the original Bushwick gallery owners, only people who came to Bushwick just recently. Peter Hopkins objected that they wouldn’t accept the invitation for a panel discussion anyway. We can sense certain tension between the “old” and the “new” gallery owners in Bushwick… Peter Hopkins also said that he expects a lot from the discussion and that “It will be a dividing point. Bushwick 2.0 begins now.”,Bushwick is changing. That much we can state without any doubt. The question is how will the change be? Friendly? Natural? To the benefit of us all? Or drastic? Exclusionary? And eventually pushing the rents so high that the artists will leave?,Let’s see. About this and more, will be the discussion tonight from 6 to 9pm at The Bogart Salon at 56 Bogart. ,.

Arts and Culture,"A year and half of thoroughly deep research of the Bushwick art scene, which led us to:,Basically, that’s what it took us here at Bushwick Daily to make a decision to start ,.,We lovingly named it ,.,However, our aspirations weren’t to create just another regular Bushwick gallery; we were thrilled to create some alternative platform, something that hasn’t been explored yet… And since the Internet is our favorite kind of space, we decided to build a gallery online!,A gallery showing Bushwick art based on the Internet has many features that a physical gallery doesn’t, and we are eager to explore them.,An opening at an Internet gallery can allow so many more people to “attend” than an opening at a regular Bushwick space. On December 16, 2011 when we officially announced the launch of ,, we had over 900 people from 10 countries come see some gorgeous Bushwick art, which is a number that can be hardly beat by even the most popular physical art space in Bushwick.  Another big advantage is that our exhibitions are accessible to anyone in the world at any time. Not only during weekends or by an appointment. While stone-and-mortar Bushwick galleries have to rely on the L train, we only rely on the Internet.,Naturally, there are a bunch of awesome things about physical galleries. Like openings! Openings are wonderful! You can come out talk to the artists, curators, gallerists, and have fun! That is some non-virtual fun, as it should be. We couldn’t give this up. There is only as much fun you can have behind the screen of your computer.

Arts and Culture,"They say it was a cult, but to me it was a sci fi cult. And a lot of fun too…,On Sunday night, I cautiously walked down the dark stairs to the basement of a house at 70 Jefferson St. in Bushwick. That’s where , gallery is. Airplane is one of the newest galleries in Bushwick, opened in October 2011, and it’s run by artists Lars Kremenr, Liz Atzberger, and Kevin Curran.,I opened the door, and walked in. The neon light, basement esthetics, quirky art on the walls and on the floor, artist Julie Torres, wearing an army jumpsuit waving at me. I instantly thought of the hatch in the TV series ,, or about the sci fi movie ,. “Wow, pretty crazy,” I thought to myself. And that’s exactly what the four artists had in mind when they created a concept for the experimental art marathon and show called ,.,, ,, , and ,, met up at Airplane gallery on Friday midnight. Each of them being a unique individual artists with a distinctive work, they decided to create an installation throughout 3 days, and show it in a one night exhibition only. …and they chose cult as the theme.,I was really curious how did each of these artists play with the theme of cult. I could easily imagine Don Pedro Pablo or Ryan Ford creating some cult objects, but I was really curious about abstract painter Julie Torres or Liz Atzberger who uses bright materials a lot.,The results were really cool!,Ryan Ford created some kind of a weird altar balancing on pyramid with creepy eyes. On the altar there was a bunch of strange cult objects from a gold cassette to a cross. I suspect Ryan of being a really hyperactive artist who just can’t stop painting or sculpting quirky funny objects. Ryan also painted a wall.,Don Pablo Pedro created a praying corner where you could go down on your knees and pray to the crazy cult of weird figures with multiple eyes and limbs. I believe that a role of a cult leader suits Pedro really well.,Julie Torres made a wall using ropes, plastic bags and …her paintings. Really interesting shift in the works of this abstract cult member…. In addition she thoughtlessly collected  envelopes, paper bags and papers, pinned them onto a wall and painted spots on them…. This part of her work strongly reminded me of the current exhibition of , in 11 Gagosian galleries all around the world, showing, well, spot paintings. I inquired about a potential connection of cult logic and Damien Hirts, but she said the resemblance must be purely incidental. Right… ,Liz Atzberger is probably the tiniest of all the Bushwick artists, however after seeing her work, I believe she could start her own cult and be  the leader of it. Yup. She created an abstract cult object to pray on using multitude of materials and colors.,Btw, I was also lucky enough to catch a comedian duo Ross Moreno and Justin Cooper performing, doing lame magic tricks, and taking off their clothes…","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

Mind and Body,"It’s up to you which one of the Bushwick’s faces you choose to see everyday. You may choose to see galleries, trendy bars, poverty, dirty streets. Some Bushwick residents choose to see mystical and spiritual side of their every day life…,If you live in Bushwick, I am sure you have noticed a number of stores selling religious objects, amulets, candles and folklore medicine. They are called , and they are common in Hispanic countries, especially in the communities with ties to the Caribbean. Botanicas in Bushwick are not dedicated to one religion or belief nowadays, they are a “, mixing of various immigrant populations and religious traditions, bilingualism, assimilation, and the marketing of culture… “,

,I have been passing by a Botanica , on 1252 Myrtle Ave, which is around the corner of my house, for months. I’ve often been able to smell the incense burning in front of their door for the entire mile. I have seen altars with offerings of beer, whiskey, money or candy to a statue of Jesus, or a black saint. I have also recognized statues of Buddha, elephants, and other symbols typical for Hinduism, Buddhism and other eastern philosophies.,I was intrigued but a little bit intimidated, so it was only shortly after Halloween that I found the courage to come in. Elisabeth, a co-owner of the store who is originally from Haiti, smiled at me as I requested candles for good luck. She told me that I need seven tall colorful candles, but I bought only three of them. A pink Divino Nino Jesus, green Buena Suerte and blue Pisces astrology one. As she was adding drops of incense oil and glitter into each of the candles, Elisabeth casually mentioned that they just had a burning skull appear in the store. “Right above the burned spot where the man is repairing the floor,” she said. I looked and saw a worker removing burned floor between in the door, which connects the store with the back where Elisabeth reads tarot for her customers. She offered a reading, but I respectfully declined.,A couple of months went by before I visited Elias again. Yellow and blue scarves were hanging on the door as I entered. A pale yorkshire was standing in the door and he requested constant attention as I walked in, jumping as high as up to my waist. But when I tried to pet him, he bit me. Oh well… “Alex! Don’t be needy!” A young boy from Haiti behind the counter smiled at me. His canine teeth were long and pointed. I froze. But he turned out to be really nice, so I didn’t escape right away. He said that Elisabeth was giving a reading, and let me photograph the store while I waited. An elderly woman came out from the back and left the store. Shortly, Elisabeth invited me to the back and, despite not liking being photographed, she let me take a couple of pictures of her and we talked.,About 2 and half years ago. Before that I worked in another Botanica.,It is a religious store for people who practice mystic work, like Haitian voodoo or African magic. It is a Santeria for people who believe in miracles and that everything is possible.,No, it’s not just one religion, it’s universal. It is for people in this world who believe in what we are doing here rather than to what is being done in churches. I was myself raised as Catholic, but I chose what I do. Like everyone else has a choice to explore what they believe in, and to find out about other stuff that Albert Eistein and Aleister Crowley were talking about.,Most of what we do here is Haitian voodoo. We also practice African magic and formation of the laws. Laws mean the earthly souls. The souls that pass on, but still live within us… Most of this deal with roots. There can be different divisions of saints. For example this is Saint Baba [she points at a statue of a black female saint standing on the table]. She can have four different divisions.,We work with colors a lot. Each color has a different meaning, and signifies a different influence. If we want to achieve peace, calmness and purity, we use white. Red is life’s blood, and signifies passion. Pink is passion too. Green is for peace among family members and for earthly things like money. Yellow is radiance, color of the sun. Black is very controversial and a lot of people choose not to use black. But I like the color black. I also like purple. Purple means dignity.,I have been practicing a religion since I was 9, but I have been serious about this for about 7 years.,Three quarters of people here believe in what I do, and they have seen it work for themselves. They keep coming to me for more and more miracles, and to fix their pains in their private lives, especially their love lives, or to restore the peace in their families. They also come for financial blessings and prosperity and for spiritual cleansings. I do all these things, and it is my way of giving back. This is what I chose to do. It might not be what everyone likes, but this is my choice. When I’m gone, one of my kids will continue this tradition. This is my calling…,Yes, I have 21 different decks of cards. Each person likes a different deck and they chose which one they like the best.,No, it’s $21 per consultation. But it depends, because sometimes I let the spirits to come through me, and that costs more, because then the spirits possess me. I let in the ancestors, the relatives, who speak through me with other people, with their families. It’s really touching and emotional sometimes. People feel gratified and satisfied to hear from the dead.,You know, for the money I get, I buy offerings, food, flowers, whatever the saints like. The rest of the money is collected for the bills. I have to pay my bills, so that I can run my business and help people. So money is not as important, but it’s a necessity to keep the store open. If the customers don’t have money, it’s ok…,No, I don’t think that anyone can do this. I was born with a gift to see into the future. I have been able to predict a lot of things, since I’ve been doing this. A lot of people take it insignificantly, but what I predicted happens right in front of their face. Whenever I give readings to my customers, it’s accurate. If they don’t see it right away, they will see it within 2 or 3 days. I believe in myself; it’s a gift from God. I cherish the gift that I’ve been given and I will continue, although I there is a lot of controversy and a lot of people doubting… If the customers did not prove me, I would not be here.,I don’t classify myself as a psychic. I’m a medium that transforms information depending on what the interest of my customers is. I can’t explain it, but what I can say is that I will not condemn any psychic or medium, because they are certified in what they are doing. I have to support them, because I believe in this, and I live it everyday. Regarding other psychics, I don’t care, I’m me, I’m original, I’m unique, I’m different from everyone else. I’m not proud of it, but I’m thankful and humble…","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily. She can easily be moved by reflection of the sky in a puddle.

Arts and Culture,"The wind is knocked out of you. You can’t figure out if you’re so incredibly happy or so impossibly mad, and you’re confused how they can feel so similar. You might burst, explode, boil over, your face hurts from smiling, your gut hurts from crying, your throat hurts from screaming and laughing, you’re being stretched in two different directions but going the same way. You don’t know if you’re in heaven or in hell. Yet there is serenity.,This sounds intense, but they are the emotions conveyed in Bushwick artist Anna Pipe’s work on view at ,.  Leaning right over and above us as we started our interview was an image of a girl. She seems to blend into the painting, as if she’s being born from the paint. She tries to separate herself from the canvas she’s stuck to by leaning forward, laughing, emitting an almost manic smile. She is surrounded by bursts of color and energy forming from her abstract world. There is a feeling of both happiness and tension; you can almost hear both laughter and screams.,“The feeling I really wanted to show was a really saturated intensity of an energy,” said Anna of this piece, and others in the show, “almost to the point of overwhelming and threatening energy that is almost bubbling over, but it isn’t quite there yet. It could either be really beautiful or really terrifying.”,This contrast of beauty and terror give her visually stunning pieces an entirely different layer of depth. In a series of three red paintings for example, a sort of angel vs. devil vibe is happening. The paintings are of abstract red angles with faint gold veins running through them. They reminded me of a sort of fiery landscape, like a topographical map covered in lava. Yet one can make out faint figures lurking under thick swirls of red.,“Of course we’re all interested in humans. But I don’t like how with a portrait of someone, you know looking at a specific person, because you can’t really interpret as much, or you relate to it too much,” Anna said. “It doesn’t hide anything, so with these ones I like that you know it’s a human or some sort of entity but you can’t tie it down to a specific place or time, it becomes more ethereal.”,In the series, one figure, seemingly female, seems so at peace in her red world. She floats effortlessly, her soft otherworldly features barely distinguishable between the curves of the abstracted lines and shapes in the work. This painting’s counterpart however, is the exact opposite. She faces you head on. Her facial structure is angular, she appears to be fighting with the painting rather than enjoying her surroundings.,What adds a new layer of curiosity to Anna’s work as well, is that she paints from photographs. And not in the way one would thing. She doesn’t paint what’s in the photograph, but the object itself.,“I like the idea of painting the photograph instead of painting what’s in the photograph. It’s not trying to take the subject out of the picture and turning into something else, its painting an actual object,” Anna explained.,After hearing this, I looked up at the red pictures and thought…ok, what on earth (literally, what of this world!) could those be pictures of!  Anna explained to me that they were a happy accident that resulted from multiple occurrences like a wonky camera that picks up subtleties in a room, and a red lamp from the ’70s.,These successful images were a combination of unintentional events. Where as many of us go on camera walks or head out looking for amazing instagram photos to take, Anna thinks her next project will be painting found photographs. “I feel like if I go out and look for things to photograph it might be forced,” she mentioned.,I have seen some really cool, creative, beautiful and conceptual work as of late. But I haven’t “felt” a painting like this in a while. Most artists strive to achieve something more than a visual experience, and Anna’s works give you that almost instantly. If you can head over to North Williamsburg this weekend, I would highly recommend checking out her work before it gets taken down.","On a mission to expose the NYC art scene for what it is - fun, inspiring and exciting!

In the Hood,"There’s something brewing inside ,, a , that caught my attention, and it wasn’t a band.,Instead of filling the place with the usual music venue decor – posters, stickers and some graffiti – the owners decided to make the walls into a sort of living, breathing art project that’s continuously developing.,Maybe “living” and “breathing” were poor choices of words considering the subject matter…. On a wall in the space is a lone skeleton, standing from floor to ceiling, frozen in time as he somberly plays his guitar. His large hat hints to us that he was once a member of a mariachi band, now playing tunes from the grave. His bony fingers grip the guitar at sharp angles, yet he appears to be effortlessly stroking the strings. His bright white cartilage contrasts with the deep warm color behind him, the color of algae resting on a serene lake under a deep blue night sky. His whittled tree bark-like guitar perhaps carved from a piece of drift wood.,
,The piece called , is inspired by a combination of Mexico’s Day of the Dead and mariachi music, a theme Bushwick based artist and musician, Jeremey Aquilino has been drawn to and working with for quite some time. He often creates different groupings of skeletal mariachi men using his characters and sometimes bases them on real bands. That leaves me wondering which musicians inspired which?,“Last year I was living over in northern Bushwick close to Ridgewood, and my neighbors would always play Spanish music, and loud (he makes a bass reggae tone noise). It would just be everywhere, and I started painting this stuff last year in that apartment,” Jeremy said with a tone of possibly coming to a realization. “So it could have been influenced by that.”,What’s also cool about the piece is there is a the possibility to add more characters, so that the lone skeleton can maybe one day form his own band. This piece, along with additional paintings in the basement of neon aliens in a geometric patterned planet, are all evolving. The artists at Big Snow seem to take pride in the fact that they never actually consider their work finished.,“It might stay as is or it might change over the next few months,” Jeremy looking up at the skeleton with adoration and skepticism, “I like to look at all my artwork as unfinished. It leaves me the option of adding, who knows,” Jeremy said.,
,“I kind of like the constant art that’s been developing in this place,” Jeremy said, “like over there, that happened last night” he points to a drawing pasted up on a mirror, a scene of a grumpy old woman scowling at the venue that was drawn by someone working the door during a show at the venue the night before.,This music venue is charming; I imagine it didn’t set out to become an art space. But to me, with the well-crafted stylized paintings along with the cool transformative and collaborative working styles, it seems like a great creative environment where inspiration and artist collaboration kind of drips from the walls. That defines an art space, right? So if you’re going to check out your favorite band at Big Snow, look around, you might see something different each time.","On a mission to expose the NYC art scene for what it is - fun, inspiring and exciting!

But she also grasped something beautiful and unspoken. Beyond all of this terrible decay, life continued. The community was stronger than its walls. Her images show neighbors picnicking besides ramshackle cars and girls playing jump rope beside graffiti-covered homes. “People are still together and still having a laugh amidst this garbage and nonsense,” said Randolph Osmyn Beers, one of Meisler’s former art students, who visited the gallery opening night.",,"Happening,Here I Am: Bushwick in the 1980s,Meryl Meisler,Shannon Firth,Soho Photo Gallery","

Music,"I headed over to one of Bushwick’s newest venues called ,to check out one of my recent obsessions, ,, who played with , and , on Friday, 2 weeks ago. The three local bands were harmonious on the same bill- all shared elements of drone, psychadelia, and scattered percussion. It was great to finally see Big Snow- a venue that’s been raved about recently- in its Friday night glory. The crowd was subdued- a mixture of beer-drinking wallflowers, enthusiastic musicians and listeners who wore their coats inside, ladies with cat-eye makeup, and those three stoned guys who never left the couch made for an intimate crowd setting.,Besides the surprisingly great (and only slightly deafening) sound quality in the front room, the best thing about this venue are the coated brick walls- crawling with an array of paintings. Upstairs and in the basement, there are a handful of different artists working together to give the walls new life. More images of those murals below.,The show started out with ,, a Brooklyn trio who name drop the Zen Theorizer, and play loud and loopy psychedelic garage songs . While facing away from the audience for most of their set (stylistic choice, or were the visualizers too much?), they were well received for their brief but passionate set. Though there’s not much to be gleamed about them online, my friend Jenn over at altered zones , and described their sound as “channel[ing] alien airwaves through a microwave oven attached to a bus.” Listen to the mp3 below and hear that radiation through your headphones.,, with the most terribly vague but somehow apt name, was a a treasure upon first listen. One man, crooning with eyes closed into filtered mic, with lots of loops pedals and a lovely acoustic guitar, makes reverb and surf pop come together in a uplfting way. 60s influenced, drone interpreted, ambient like waves crashing upon a shore… all in all very pretty. Look out for this guy, I think he’s Panda Bear’s cousin or something… and ,, his album S/T is up for free download., , as one of the best bands I saw at CMJ, and was aurally rewarded seeing them again, in a much less stressful showcase. They played in their element, pacing their psychedelic delves for just the right instances and taking their time arriving at climactic jam points. These dudes bring a mystical sound to their garage ambience- blending animal-collective-feels-era experimental vocal tinges and majestic guitars atop layered ambient drone jams, their sound hit the right levels in Big Snow’s intimate front room.

Music,"Saying that , is a band to keep an eye on in the coming year would probably be an understatement and, based on the buzz they’ve been generating (as a favorite at CMJ and in profiles by ,, , and ,), it feels like a syllogism at this point. I caught their set at the Music Hall of Williamsburg on Friday where  they debuted two new tracks, opening for Deleted Scenes and Bear Hands.  And it was boldly jaw-dropping in a very why-haven’t-I-heard-this-before  way.,A five piece electro-rock/pop anthem machine with roots in Williamsburg  and Bushwick, Fort Lean puts out a strikingly mature sound for a new  band with just a four-track EP to their name.Though the scale of the venue represented new terrain for them, they performed less like a band crossing into uncharted territory than like a home-team late in the season. This tight performance presence mixed with the maturity of their compositions and the blow-your-hair-back intensity of front-man Keenan Mitchell’s vocals was like Clint Eastwood’s appearance in a local saloon at the beginning of a ,-type Western: Very hard not to pay attention to.,At first glance the gritty juke-box feel of their refreshingly straight forward tunes nearly overshadows the complexity of their musicianship, but it quickly becomes clear that all five band members contribute more or less equally to the sound and are comfortable wearing multiple hats. Guitarist Zach Fried and keyboardist Will Runge both provide significant vocals and Runge spends about half the show with a guitar in hand. This multi-faceted showmanship reads as a further ace up these guys’ rather crowded sleeves: there were moments when I found myself watching Fried’s impressive fretwork (and footwork for that matter) only to realize that it was Mitchell taking the solo.,
Of course, if all that didn’t leave a lasting impression Mr. Mitchell provided a K.O. punch by peeling back his lip to show us a bloody gash while he described how being jumped in an elevator for his rolling tobacco formed the inspiration for one of their new tunes.,
The takeaway: this already strong band is full of surprises, improving steadily, ready for more and here to stay. Fort Lean’s upcoming release on Neon Gold is out in February. Until then you’ll have to catch them live to hear what they’ve been up to lately, which, based on their performance, has been a hell of a lot and well worth our attention.",,"Bushwick,Fort Lean,Happening,music,Paul Hiam","

Arts and Culture,"A fellow Bushwick resident,  ,, was lucky and talented enough to be selected as one of the Virgens in Karen O’s , This music/art/theater performance piece, or a “Psycho Opera” if you want, took place at , this past fall. An ethereal and dramatic tribute to love, loss, the future and memory, the opera unfolded like a dream, floating from one scene to the next among sweeping musical numbers and dynamic stage visuals- oh, and terrific costume changes.,The project was a monumental accumulation of almost 10 years of work on Karen’s part. Karen, who’s best known for ,‘ cult status as a art punk band, actually studied film in college. When she first wrote the songs for the musical about 7 years ago, she originally saw what came to be Stop the Virgens as a series of short films or vignettes. In that time of period, she wrote the songs in a stream-of-conciousness process that amounted to the soundtrack of the show. Through her work with co-creator of the show, KK Barrett, who’s done set production on Spike Jonze and Sophia Coppola films, and collaborations with other visual producers, the psycho opera came about. The production was raved about, by audience members, press, and everyone in the show itself, including Nadia Hulett. So I sat down with Nadia, who gave me insights into the performance piece and Karen O’s legendary status as a creator…,[quote]Karen came out and said basically, “The only way I know how to thank you is by singing to you.” Then the YYYs started performing for us, starting with Maps and going through some of their singles. It was amazing.[/quote],We were called Virgin acolytes- We were a body of girls, we created the world that the audience entered into. We were like a maze of bodies, helping people find their way into the theater. We also created a soundscape throughout the show, being a chorus. Everything from the show came from Karen’s head, her experiences- as a group, we were important to the show by being extensions of her vision.,We were dressed like young choir girls…in white costumes and wigs. We were instructed to portray ourselves as ferel girls, otherwordly, not quite human. We were all told to all embody the same character, and we we all performed in the same way, but, Karen was humbled by the diversity in skills we all brought, from musical theater girls and all the experience we brought.,She’s really nice, she’s kooky, she’s brilliant. She’s internalizes a lot, but when she performs she’s wild. There’s a switch in her that she just turns on when she performs, it’s amazing.,I always hoped I would, but i didn’t expect this to happen so quickly. It was so fast- heard about it a few days before, auditioned, found out a few days later. We rehearsed for a few weeks, put it up for a few weeks and then… it was done. I hoped and knew that something like this would happen.,Not only musicians, but artists, directors, etc that are so talented and passionate, and I guess I looked at all of them and thought “Why not me?” .  There was this focus that came about to keep shooting for such cool things. To keep working hard and find these kinds of people near me to collaborate in the future.,The other members of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs- Nick Zinner, Brian Chase- plus up to 10 other people were performing at all times. The drummer and the bassist were both members of , and , . The cellist is one of the co-founders of (venue in the west village) Le Poisson Rouge, too.,Nick [Zinner] had his camera all the time with him taking photos of the entire experience. They’re not for public display. I think he’s not sure what to do with them. But they’re out there.,One night before the show closed, they wanted to thank everyone in the production in a special way and they called us as if we were gonna have a meeting and gave us some Bud Lights and Coronas and Karen came out and said basically, “The only way I know how to thank you is by singing to you.” Then the YYYs started performing for us, starting with , and going through some of their singles. It was amazing. It went back to me being a small part of the chorus, and it wasn’t just me that was moved, everyone was so moved.

People,": Teddy Sczudlo,: Yoga Teacher,: In the very fashion of a spiritual gangster, he throws jokes between complicated asanas.,: Because of his sunshine personality, and because he teaches an amazingly spriritual yoga with a sense of humor.,: text him at (202) 400 8074 and he will keep you updated on the classes.,: Every Monday and Wednesday at 7:30pm at Opera House, 27 Arian Pl., Bushwick.,***,Ridiculously cheerful Christmas song is blasting from the speaker in a dimly lit dance studio at Opera House, Bushwick. Teddy Sczudlo, the yoga teacher, is laughing, clearly amused by his own choice of music to finish the yoga practice today.,The class is laughing with Teddy, as they are rolling their yoga mats and putting their socks back on.  There is something uplifting, deeply moving and relaxing in the air.  I can’t help myself but lovingly smile at everyone else. The switch in my head happened in the middle of the class, when I opened my eyes after an asana. The air suddenly seemed clear and crisp, and I felt enormous energy in my heart. Teddy probably saw the pleasant confusion on my face and he said laughing: “It’s working, right?”,Teddy puts on his sweatshirt that says ,, and admires how the common area in the basement of Opera House has cleared out ever since we started to practice yoga in the dance studio: “Before there was always someone getting wasted and partying. Not anymore…”,Teddy, who is a fine art photographer by day, started to flirt with yoga when he was 18. It got him. Totally. Later, his ways lead him to ,, an American teacher of Tibetan Buddhism, who was the 1st Westerner to qualify for the , degree at Sera monastery at India. Geshe Michael Roach became Teddy’s teacher, who also introduced him to Lady Niguma Yoga. After Teddy spend a year and a half in Hongkong teaching Lady Niguma, he now teaches it in Bushwick. This kind of yoga involves intensive work with all six chakras, and a lot of single pointed meditation. The results are breathtaking…,According to Teddy every New York neighborhood attracts a different kind of people. He likes that people in Bushwick are highly artistic and risky. Teddy comes to Opera House patiently twice a week regardless of the number of students that shows up. Sometimes it’s one, sometimes it’s nine. Teddy doesn’t seem to make any difference, and keeps teaching with the same level of enthusiasm. While Lady Niguma Yoga is highly spiritual, Teddy throws a joke here and there, and gives a lot of thought to the music selection. As a result, yoga the way he teaches it, is a lot of fun.,We met up for a photo shoot, nowhere else than at the Opera House. Teddy showed up in the very fashion of a spiritual gangster: in a fedora hat holding a meditation book wrapped in a red fabric.  “Try holding the book, it has an amazing energy,” says Teddy smiling. He offered a couple of acrobatic postures for the photos, and we climb up the roof despite his vertigo.,“Yoga and art are synonyms to me,” he said while climbing the stairs…","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

In the Hood,"There’s an alley alongside the , Gallery in Bushwick that is both welcoming and foreboding. If you’re not used to the somewhat desolate and industrial area, it shines like a sign that says “walk over here and you’re going the right way.” It’s foreboding in that it looks like a passageway out of Law & Order: SVU. There’s a fence on its last legs, broken glass and a forgotten tire every now and then. , took the space and made it as welcoming as a carnival, a bright and happy coat of paint and cast of characters stand on a wall to amuse you and tell you a story.,A cast of characters happily guide you down the alley. Snakes swirling around cracks in the wall, smiling cowboys riding bullets, pink elephants blowing steam at cigar smoking mustached men, colorful houses, boats, teddy bears, crocodiles, skeletons and musical instruments all come to life, interacting with each other down a long brick wall. It’s as if these creations are all mingling with each other down a long corridor of a frat party.,The fact that the bright colors make the alley a much happier place did not happen by chance.,“Lots of street art is dark and moody.” Jim said to me in a German accent over the phone. And while he admits that some of his characters may have a dark side, he likes to juxtapose their actions with multiple bright colors. “So maybe that’s my idea of life. Like you always get the mix of the nice and the not so nice, the good and the bad, and I want to reflect that in my work.”,His “ideas of life” can be attributed to his education at what he calls ”the school of life.” Having no art school experience, Jim attributes his characters’ personalities and style — German expressionism from the 20th century meeting American cartoon  and pop art — to being an observant artist.,“I really like watching people in the subway on the train, on the street, I think every face tells a story so I like to read in between the lines, simplify the face and see how far I can simplify it to show some character, some mood, and out of the intention to reduce comes the comic characters.”,While Jim doesn’t usually paint such large murals outside, he said every now and then he gets the craving to fulfill a large project like this. The size and scope of the piece is overwhelming and, if you walk up close enough to it, it’s almost like you’ve entered another world. While this world in part comes from his observations and creative mind, he also attributes them to his experience as a foreigner in the U.S. When he first came to New York, he imagined that it would be pretty similar to the city of Berlin. “But after a while,” he clarified, “you find out there are a lot of differences in the mentality. I tried to make a panorama and let all of these aspects of mentality become like characters that appear on the panorama.”,It is considered an honor to transform the wall on Factory Fresh’s side street, and Jim seemed to be aware of the great opportunity he was presented with, for even in the past he has always gravitated toward street art’s rebellious qualities in regards to the “art world” and the fact that it is “not made for selling, but displaying and showing,” he said.,While in general Jim’s characters are relateable and fun to look at, the best part about the mural is ,the fact that it is vivid and colorful plays tricks with your mind, making the viewer think twice about the relationship between the mood that often goes with these bright colors juxtaposed with what is actually going on.,You can check out the mural on Vandervoort Place on view until 2012.","On a mission to expose the NYC art scene for what it is - fun, inspiring and exciting!

In the Hood," is a Bushwick-based collective of musicians, producers, filmmakers and artists, and a source of many great ideas! These awesome guys have organized several music events in their Bushwick loft, including the famous , earlier this year; and a series of 9 music nights at Union Hall, the finale of which is taking place this Wednesday. [Paper Swan will conclude the series with a free concert starting at 8pm! More info ,.],Now Paper Swan is coming with their newest project – an ambitious idea of their own social network called ,.  Swan City will provide a platform for artists in and around Brooklyn to connect, and to share music, videos, photos, drawings, stories, poems, blog posts, links etc.,Because I had approximately 2,845 questions about how exactly they want to do it, and what they want to achieve with Swan City in the times of Facebook, I asked our pal ,from Paper Swan a couple of question.,We wanted Swan City to feel like a meeting place where artists can share their work freely. We realized that if we make it easy for people, then we’d be able to give our friends a loud voice on a small social network in a social media-frenzied world where everyone’s talking at once.,Eventually everyone! But for now, we’re asking our friends and all the people we’ve worked with over the years. We’re adding a couple users a week, so we’ll see where that takes us.,Sure there are giant social networking sites, but that doesn’t mean that there isn’t room for smaller sites with a niche. But we still use those resources to connect to a much greater pool of people, which is important as well.,We want to connect as many people as possible, and we want to feature great work from great artists. Swan City will be an ongoing dialogue that will also help to capture this fine moment in time. There are some really creative people who are contributing, and Swan City will help them share their work and connect to each other. We also want to be able to show our support for our friends’ projects, which is a big part of our mission statement.,That would be really cool! But we don’t know how to do that, and we have no money to pay anyone ,  [Bushwick Daily: Hint for you technical readers! Help Swan City if you can! , ],For us, Swan City is a way to keep up with all the friends we’ve made over the years. We’ve been fortunate enough to work with some amazing artists, and we want those people to know that once you’re in the Paper Swan family, you’re in for good! So it’s nice when our friends drop in and say hello, even if only on our website. But at least we know what they’re up to, and we get to support them and help them share their work, which we’re happy to do ,Not yet, but I’m sure Bushwick Daily could make a lot!

Arts and Culture,"When I first met Brad Henderson, he was poking at a piece from , at Bushwick gallery ,. My heart started pounding. What is this guy doing? He poked and poked away, his eyes an inch from the work, jabbing and sliding and jabbing and sliding with his index ginger. Finally and awkwardly I approached him and kind of just blurted out “What are you doing?!” It turned out, as he later put it, he was “playing a painting.”,’s show at Factory Fresh is a mix of vibrant and muted paintings on the walls, sprinkled with brightly colored sculptures of Tetris games or pieces with “limbs” sticking out of them. But one main noticeable theme strewn about in the works is that the word “vs” adorns them. Many of Ryan’s paintings use a “vs.” format, where he pits his inventive characters against each other, like in an old school combat style video game. After living on Ryan’s couch for a while, former college roommate and friend Brad decided he wanted to “play the painting.” Brad’s experience is in digital art, and was inspired by the frozen action and movement in Ryan’s flat paintings and inventive characters.,The pair began on their journey to turn the works into interactive games. The first game the two developed was ,, based off Ford’s painting of the same name. In this game a giant tarantula shoots deadly lasers out of his eyes at a large chainsaw wielding rabbit tries to chop it up.,, as it turns out, was the game I watched Brad playing at Factory Fresh, thinking he was poking at a painting. This game features the cloud eater eating clouds that are being shot out by the box. The two are working on another much more NSFW game based off of the painting titled (ahem) ,.  In this game, naked women on horses pleasure themselves to move ahead. The goal is to reach a climax without getting bumped by the police cars chasing them.,As we reminisced about the days of Atari and Nintendo, Ryan mused that the companies probably had no idea of the impact they would one day have in the art world, citing digital artist , (responsible for the famous piece ,) and metal bands that have turned things like the Super Mario Brother’s theme song into metal ballads.,Ryan and Brad’s collaboration couldn’t make more sense. Ryan paints a fantasy world of characters frozen in action and time, and Brad brings them to life.,“It was full circle,” Ryan said. “I had thought about them being video games, but I was the painter being inspired by video games and taking layouts from specific style fighting games, and then Brad comes in actually wanting to turn them into games.”,“I think our process is different because we start with a painting first. Ryan makes a still image of the game in action, and from there we riff off of it and move forward, I think that makes it different,” Brad added.,Next up for the two is to develop a series of apps to help fund their latest projects and get some exposure for their paintings. This graced the question of commercial products as art.,The apps will also help them from turning into “walking zombies,” Ryan said, naming the problem many can relate to having a boring day job to fund their latest projects. And is it worth someone struggling working 2 or 3 jobs as a waiter or a freelancer or even a stock broker when all they want to do is act, paint, write or sing? Brad answered my question and finished the interview on an optimistic note:,“Sometimes it’s very painful, trying to get things out in the world, but what makes it worth it is – what I do is like writing a novel in a way, and there will be a moment where it will just come to life, and you’ll just laugh because it’s kind of amazing. It’s those moments that make it worth it, when there’s this magic that happens on the screen.”,Be on the lookout out for these two. I think the crossover between digital and painterly art is one that has yet to be really explored, and the pairs’ Warholian concepts of high and low art, and commercial products and art is being shown in an updated and relevant way to our generation. I would not be surprised to hear of their success.","On a mission to expose the NYC art scene for what it is - fun, inspiring and exciting!

People,"Oliver Ralli likes to get his coffee at ,. He never sits inside; he prefers to occupy one of the chairs in front of the café, observing the autumn Bushwick when the color of things gets saturated and the air is crisp.,It’s year 2011, and a lot has changed in the life of the singer of a cult Bushwick band, ,, since he came to New York City in 1997.  “I never got tired of the City,” he says. We met up in front of Wycoff Starr, naturally. Oliver finished his coffee while I locked my bike. Adam, Oliver’s year-long friend and Pass Kontrol’s co-founder, who was just working his shift at the coffee shop came out to say hi. “This is what I love about this place. All the people you meet here,” Oliver smiles.,“I got keys from The Bushwick Starr. Another favorite place of mine,” Oliver says joyfully. Pass Kontrol used to rehearse at Bushwick’s experimental theater located in a huge loft. Last year in February, the band presented an apocalyptic play titled ,there, which was a huge success. The play was very loose, “ragtag,” as Oliver says.,Oliver and I bike down Flushing Ave; we’re passing the factories, trucks parked on the side of the road, and the rest of the industrial wasteland. Suddenly, a white farm with a huge green yard emerges on our right side. The fairy tale-like house hits us like a miracle. “ ,,” another place favorite place of Oliver. Four dogs bark at us, pretending to be mad to fulfill their guardian duty. They turn into lovable puppies as soon as we’re let in. The atmosphere of the Victorian house is magical. Oliver greets everyone. Pass Kontrol rehearses in the attic of the house several times a week.  “This is a very special place for me. Jessica and I got married here three years ago,” Oliver smiles about the unexpected discovery of romance in the industrial corner between Bushwick and Ridgewood.,Another favorite location Oliver wants to take me to is his home at Gates Avenue, Ridgewood.  The basement of the house is also the home to a famous gallery, ,. Ellen Letcher, one of the founders is Oliver’s neighbor and a friend. Oliver says that on the 11th of September 2011, he wanted to take a flight to his home Chicago from JFK airport. Due to the circumstances we all know, the flight was cancelled, and Oliver was forced to return to New York. “I just took random buses, because the subway was shut down too,” says Oliver. Somehow he made it to Ridgewood. That was his first time there. He remembers a strange, good feeling. A couple of years after, Oliver was living his life in Ridgewood. Good, rich life, full of love and good people.","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily. She can easily be moved by reflection of the sky in a puddle.

People,": James George,: Media artist and programmer,: Smiling geeky artist who is not afraid to smash his iPhone to measure the duration 0f the free fall.,: Because of his open source endeavors, and because through complicated programing language he can speak and please the mind of everyone.,: ,: ,That’s one thoroughly smashed iPhone.” I’m looking at the iPhone at James George’s desk. Media artist and programmer James has just moved into his brand new studio at 56 Bogart. When he invited me to check out his newest projects and awesome new space in Bushwick, I couldn’t have been more excited. Last time James and I spoke, he was leaving to spend his summer in London to work with a collective of multimedia artists on a permanent audio-visual installation , at ,.,In the video from the installation James is showing me, thousands of words collected through interviews with different people about sea are being projected in wave-like movement.,“That’s the only phone that got smashed during the , competition,” James is laughing. Free Fall Highscore is a smart phone application that measures the time, during which your phone is experiencing a free fall. The longer, the better. James He presented the Free Fall Highschore app at the , in DUMBO in October.  The bad news is that Apple rejected the application from the App Store with the explanation that Free Fall Highscore is dangerous. The application is now available only to, users and to the owners of jailbroken iPhones through Cyndia. “You know, I had always been a fan of Apple, but now I actually think Android is cooler, ” James explains. James says that Free Fall Highscore makes you challenge your materialism; it makes you put the beloved expensive toy in danger, and be creative about it. Free Fall Highscore team has organized a “phone drop ” competition recently. The task was to create a smart phone preserver so that it survives a fall from the roof of McKibbin lofts. The competitors were truly creative and came up with all kinds of different preservers from a flowerpot (who won, yay!) to a giant sock monkey. You can watch the videos from the contest ,. All the preservers were exhibited at the Creators Project.,White light is radiated from three screens on the desk while James is explaining how the programmers’ community works. The community is using ,, an open source C++ toolkit for creative programming.  James explains that even tough the community creates an open source code, they are is extremely busy to publish it at one spot once they are finished. That’s why it used to be problematic to find previously created code. “It used to be a little bit like folklore.  The information about projects was spread through the word of mouth.” That’s why James and his friend , created a website called ,. The website searches through the Internet for the created code and automatically publishes it there. The community simply finds what has been created before on one spot. “Open source is great. You can use what someone else has created, but at the same time you feel a moral obligation to make your code public,” says James. As a result, the progress in programming is faster and greater.","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

A character is when it starts to have a personality, it has a back story, you know, it has dreams and desires and goals and something it aims for,” Burgerman said.,He went on to describe that although it isn’t very possible to pinpoint exactly where these characters and their environments come from, perhaps there can be some attribution to childhood favorites like Tex Avery and Warner Brother’s Cartoons, as well as a British comic book involving the character “Beano,” who he described as the British Dennis the Menace.,Burgerman liked these characters and stories specifically for the fact that they were unlike super hero comics. There are not many adult themes of cities, cars, muscles, danger, revenge and desire or dramatic images of flowing capes, bulging biceps and leotards in these comics and cartoons. But what they did provide was an existence of their own world with their own rules.,“They’re completely bizarre but they make sense within in their own terms,” he said, sighting the instances of a character running off a cliff, standing in midair for a moment, and then falling. “That’s completely accepted. I like to think or hope that across the work that I make, it’s not as literal as hat but there is a kind of Burgerman world or a world of my work where it can all sit together.”,Drawing and painting isn’t all the artist is up to these days. He was also excited to speak of his band, ,. The band came from an idea his friend and fellow character artist Jim Avignon had, about creating a sort of art band. Burgerman learned to play the ukulele for the band, and Anxieteam seemed to become both a nice change of pace yet point of inspiration from painting and drawing. He explained that if you’re lucky enough to make a living doing what you love, unfortunately what you love becomes work. So what do you do in your free time? Enter, Anxieteam.,The band has a great influence in his artwork and vice versa.,“What I try and do is treat the making of songs the same way I would treat the making of art or drawings so the topics and ideas for songs and titles of songs could easily be a tie off for paintings and exhibitions, and I don’t see them as separate things. I see them as — I’m a person and I make stuff, and that stuff could be apparel, it could be digital, it could be made out of acrylic paint, it could be made out of pencil it could be a song or a rhyme, it could be just text, but they’re all in the same world which I created around myself so, why not music?”,You can check out Anxieteam this Wednesday the 16th at , in Greenpoint.,I first met Burgerman standing in the middle of his latest work, “The Garden of Eden, Bushwick” at , in Bushwick. On three walls of the gallery’s courtyard, we see images that have human features but are certainly not recognizable as our own, all colorful and overlapping within this lush looking atmosphere juxtaposed against Bushwick’s gritty industrial surfaces. We see animals, insects, fruits and a large scale Adam, absent of his Eve. This mural shows a different style from Burgerman, not as neat or finely drawn as we are used to seeing from him.  The painting style is a bit more rough and strokey, and he revealed that he only used brushes for this piece, no spray cans or pens. However there is no denying it’s a Burgerman creation. We still see whimsical and monsterish personalities lining the walls, all with bright colors. Being that almost all of the 4 walls are painted, it’s like for a moment you can live in Burgerman’s head, in his world.,So what motivates him to keep creating this universe?,“People always ask, so when did you start drawing, and I think that’s such a silly question because all kids draw, sine you could hold a pen, parents give kids crayons. Some people stop and other people keep going I guess”,A slew of European shows will whisk Jon Burgerman away come the new year. So you can see one of his last pieces of the year go up this weekend at Artitst Ally @ Extra place, Saturday the 19, at 2pm, where he’ll be painting a mural on the floor.","On a mission to expose the NYC art scene for what it is - fun, inspiring and exciting!

The group currently has eight members, all of whom publish and perform regularly. They meet and workshop each other’s work regularly but have been looking for a way to branch out and work with and for their community.,“We, as a collective, talked about doing an event that wasn’t a reading and that was reaching out to the community and was trying to brand our collective as the force behind the literary scene in Bushwick,” says member ,.,Eric’s past volunteer work at ,, the Books Through Bars headquarters, allowed 1441 to easily coordinate with the organization, but he also says that the collective did not just choose to run with what was easy and accessible.,“We know that what they’re doing is very important on a large scale. It’s benefiting prisoners and promoting literacy among the incarcerated population,” Eric explains. “A lot of the judicial system has been noted through panels and academic sources as largely slanted against the poor.”,Participants were able to choose one book in exchange for every two of their own. Dictionaries, a commonly requested item by prisoners, could be relinquished for one drink ticket. Roughly 100 books were packed away at the end of the night. About 60 paperbacks were shipped to Books Through Bars the following day.

Yes, that’s that huge yellow industrial building right across the street from Morgan, L train station. This Friday might be a good day to check out the new gallery arcade! 56 Bogart is a home to 6, soon to be 7 galleries. One of our favorite art spaces, ,, has finally made a big move from their location at Grand St., and will feature ,, in the building on Friday too.,Besides NURTUREart, you should not miss a closing at The Bogart Salon. This newbie to Bushwick art scene will feature the last of the series of salons, titled ,. The thing is that The Bogart Salon isn’t a typical gallery. Peter Hopkins of The Bogart Salon told me that they plan to organize a salon as every other show. “The regular shows will fund the salons,” he said. Peter also told me that nowadays the artists work separately from each other in a studio and he isn’t a big fan of this concept. Instead of the artistic solitude, he prefers the 19th century salons. Artists used to create in a common room; they would discuss, party, and inspire each other. Peter is now trying to revive this old-fashioned vehicle and fill it with a new media form….,The reference point for the salon is a famous painting by Édouard Manet, , or The Luncheon on the Grass. The Bogart Salon has recreated the painting with models and a piece of grass in the middle of the room. Since the opening of the salon 5 weeks ago, different artists have been coming in to talk and create their vision inspired by the painting in all kinds of media. The walls at The Bogart Salon are now almost covered with different pieces of art from drawings, graphic images, to photographs. There is even a claymation inspired by Manet’s painting…,One last art salon featuring the nude models, drinks, a lot of art supplies waiting for you to be used, is taking place this Friday from 6 to 9pm. The Bogart Salon is inviting everyone to come and take a part. Peter Hopkins says they are trying to provoke the interchange of traditional roles in art: artist, critic, collector. Even the models are encouraged to get involved in the creative process.,Peter Hopkins says that new is actually never new, we simply just stopped trying. He approached me as a local blogger to take a part at the last ,salon, and I gladly accepted. I will be live-tweeting from The Bogart Salon, commenting on the happening, reviewing the art in making and encouraging a dialogue in the virtual space of Twitter with the people at the closing but also around the world. Every tweet using the hashtag , will be projected on the wall, and additionally we will be displaying the Twitter feed on our website, here at Bushwick Daily.","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

Sue, an incredibly interesting and adorable lady from Thailand, sold amazingly stylish and cute dresses in a remodeled garage on Central Avenue in Bushwick. I was stunned to discover designer brands, such as Chanel, Prada and Valentino, for as little as $15.,Over the past year, Sue and I became friends and I never neglected to visit her in the store whenever I saw it open. Sue has been a resident of Bushwick for more than 30 years and she has a bunch of interesting stories about the neighborhood in the old days. She would treat me to a chocolate milk or tea and always asked if I was doing all right, if I wasn’t too broke, and if I was seeing someone nice. She would always be very honest about how I looked in a particular piece of clothing, and so the clothes I bought at Sue’s Vintage Boutique are some of my favorites.,Recently, I went to Sue’s with my roommate Zuska to find out that she had moved her boutique around the corner to Flushing Ave and her new space is even cuter that the previous one. She recently visited her family in Bangkok, and was very excited to bring back more cute clothes, mostly vintage designer brands, to sell in the store. She told me that she was just getting ready to unpack the Fall/Winter clothes, and I couldn’t be more excited. It was the first time my roommate Zuska had visited Sue’s store and, naturally, she loved it. We spent the afternoon playing like little girls digging through their grandma’s closet, trying on different outfits, and having tons of fun. Madonna look? Argentinean president’s widow? Frankie Goes to Hollywood, the female version? We tried it all…,I suggested to Sue that she have an outfit try-on party at her store on Saturday, and she loved the idea! We are now inviting all the Bushwick Daily girls to Sue’s Vintage Boutique at the corner of Flushing and Bogart St., right off Morgan L train stop, from 3pm to 6pm to play with us. Sue will be serving free mimosas and playing jazz on her old-fashioned stereo.

Music,"This year’s College Music Journal Music Festival- aka ,- is a whirlwind of ,, ,, ,, ,and ,. I crusied through the festival, mostly going to unofficial shows (,, Fader Fort, KCRW, Anti-CMJ House parties, etc), and wound up seeing an unexpectedly diverse array of amazing bands. After a much thinking, here are ,(in no particular order), including an Mp3 from each! Spoiler altert: Doldrums, Zambri, Delicate Steve…,, of Montreal, doesn’t only pull a name reference from Ariel Pink’s classic album, he also encorporates some of those weird L.A. retro-pop vibes, throws them in a glitch-blender, adds a solid drum machine a little bit of sped-up indie sunshowers. Fun to listen to and a pleasure to see live, Doldrums have toured with , and are currently backing ,, so expect to see great things on the horizon., hit me hard with their uncategorizable, experimental, thoroughly enjoyable sound. To label this band is so difficult- from one song to the next they jump from instrumental Hendrix-inspired guitar songs to tropical jam melodies with tenderly mumbled vocals. Not to mention the huge array of instruments they used onstage. They recently toured with ,, who I find to be their closest musical associates with a diverse, raw, and always evolving sound. Delicate Steve produces more youthful, more unpredictable, more balanced, and less canned songs that are breathtaking and whimsical. Really a fantastic band, and a completely enveloping live performance.,Canadians and up-and-comers ,hail from modern-day Montreal but musically seems not from this time. Bizarre minimal melodies, a deep and booming voice, and the occasional surf guitar picking make their live show surprisingly enthralling. On headphones, the music feels personal and lonely- earnest vocals with goth undertones- seeming like a custom-made mixtape., does the Brooklyn electronic duo pretty flawlessly. Switching from drums to keys but constantly manning their pedals and mic, their sound is a form of dream pop- dramatic and intricate, but still very accesible. Their live show kills people with fun, and their fanbase likes to go wild.,By far the sexiest group I saw at CMJ is,, an electronic Brooklyn duo of experimental-gypsy ladies that look like they could be sisters. Sisters that make your heart beat quick and your ears hurt so good. Their music resembles a gothic Kate Bush.  Having an abraisive quality that is tangibly pleasurable live, for once the level of sensuality and talent balances the scales.,- This underrated Brooklyn band kinda blew my mind. They are very detailed-oriented instrumentally, not sacrificing any extra sounds for an unnecessarily noisey effect, and their vocals are heavy and sensual.  Sometimes bright synths add a suspenseful element, other times the band vibes a more alternative sound. This band is certainly enigmatic, and I’d have them no other way.,, where to begin- this is where saxophones and crossdressing meet in a musically awesome way. These guys are hipster hippies- maybe by that I just mean another ” Brooklyn art collective”- their genre-spanning music promotes simple messages of love and encouragement, while their live show comes bundled in jackets tied together in Christmas lights, a crowd dance circle, hand painted signs, and costumes for everyone in the crowd. The most fun and interactive show I saw all CMJ., love you guys, ,. “To listen is to fall into a cathartic, emotional listening experience. They blend melodic, fall-off-the-bone tender vocals with organic rhythms.” Blah, blah, blah…. but listen to the MP3 and tell me it isn’t true!,, with dual drummers, far-off poetic vocals and atomsopheric jam sound, is probably my favorite new band I discovered at CMJ. A Brooklyn-via-Denver band, rural undertones carry through their songs. There’s a “freak folk” element to their music- they take risks encorporating less-than-poppy sound samples – but the organic nature of the loops makes even the extraterrestrial sound bytes feel right in place. Can’t wait to see them again when their set isn’t cut short by CMJ’s set-sandwiching.,Florida’s , perfects a smooth type of chillwave that’s more suited for a beach party than a blacklight club- and that’s a good thing. With cresendoing keyboard melodies and familiar beats, his vocals glide atop lush, oceanic, feelgood rhythms. Performing alone and closing out the night I saw him at Pianos, he had everyone dancing to his mellow-but-evervescent tunes.,WAAAAY MORE PICS (of all the bands) OVER ",strict rule breaker. photographer. music obsessee. brooklynite.,"delicate steve,doldrums,millionyoung,monogold,new moods,pat jordache,terror pigeon dance revolt,Tiny Victories,woodsman,zambri","

People," Abel Macias,Fine art painter who sometimes turns into a street artist, in the memory of good ol’ days before his arrest.,Wheat-pasted yellow bunnies and spray-painted pink stormy clouds, Abel is an optimistic hedonist, whose world is beautiful and has more colors than the worlds of the most of us.,Yellow bunnies. Or the pink storm cloud.,I can’t decide which one of Abel’s signature pieces of art I like better. Yellow bunnies have taken over the outer walls of my favorite Bushwick café, ,. But seeing a pink storm cloud sprayed on the wall at the corner of Flushing and Central Avenues means I am almost done with my daily run through Bushwick.,Since a couple of weeks ago, Little Skips surrendered a large part of their inside and outside space to the art of Abel Macias. I like being able to see the yellow bunnies from the M train when it’s arriving to the Myrtle/Broadway station.,The pink storm cloud sprayed on the wall in Abel’s Bushwick studio is brighter than the one on the corner of Flushing and Central. Abel Macias, a Bushwick resident for about three years, says that it must be his Mexican origins that influence his choice of palette. “I love Mexico and its colorful culture so much! Its iconography inspires a lot,” says Abel. Abel grew up in Atlanta but his both parents come from Guadalajara and he loves to visit his family still living there.,Abel Macias lives and works in an awesome house at Willoughby Avenue. His studio is in the basement and his and his roommate’s, bedrooms are on the ground floor. They have remodeled their house, and I can’t stop admiring it. Abel’s house is definitely one of the best places in Bushwick I have visited so far. They have a huge open space living room, full of interesting artifacts. There is a sewing machine, where his roommate makes clothes and jewelry for Brooklyn Flea and Etsy. Abel’s lazy dog is sleeping in his bed.,Abel’s art is similar to his easygoing and optimistic nature. “Life is Good,” says one of his pieces. The letters are surrounded by pink floating scoops of ice cream.,While I admire Abel’s fine art pieces hanging in his studio and in Little Skips, I feel like Abel is too playful to stay locked inside, and would appreciate taking his art out in the streets. “How do you feel about street art, Abel?” I ask him. “I like it, but Brooklyn jail is no joke,” Abel says. Ever since his arrest due to street art about a year ago, Abel has been making street art only when permitted. He was arrested in Bushwick on a cold snowy night for spraying a pink cloud on a wall, he says. “I had just gotten out of the Jefferson subway stop. No one was around but sure enough, as soon as I was about to finish a piece an undercover cop car pulls up,” Abel says sadly. Abel adds that he fully cooperated with the cop but was treated like shit anyhow. He spent 24 hours in a crowded cell in a Downtown Brooklyn jail. “I think it’s rather unfortunate how street artists get treated so harshly by the local police. They get unjustly punished and grouped with criminals that really do endanger society,” Abel says.","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

In the Hood,": 107 Himrod St.,: Gladys and Julio Franco-Colon,: Robby Franco-Colon and extended family,In a place like Bushwick, with its industrial landscape and lack of greenery, a little cheery lighting and merry spirit can go a long way. Gladys and Julio Franco-Colon of 107 Himrod St. have maintained this outlook for the 13 years they’ve lived here. Their son Robby, dressed year-round as an angel, only makes the process more enjoyable for them, they tell me.,We briefly discussed the family’s early years of Bushwick living. Those early years were tough, Gladys told me. This, of course, comes as no surprise to anyone familiar with the neighborhood’s history of violence and drugs. The house is one of several on the block that has a lawn, an atypical addition around here, and is still equipped with a heavy fence that needs to be locked from the inside and outside. Trick-or-treating, treated today as an activity to be carried out with extreme caution (or not at all) by overbearing parents everywhere, was considered truly unwise in Bushwick over a decade ago. Gladys is happy that things have since changed for the better.,But we didn’t dwell on the past so much. We quickly moved on to other more current, lighthearted topics – decoration placement, photography, and Robby’s singing abilities.,Check out the slideshow below.

First of all, we photography lovers at Bushwick Daily are beyond excited to have this incredible resource at our disposal. The darkroom, which is a private, one-room do-it-all space is Bushwick’s first affordable printing facility… and best of all, it’s affordable! I spoke with the owner of the darkroom, Lucia Rollow, briefly about it.,Lucia studied photography at SVA and had been working in the darkroom since she was 13. Disheartened by the fact that black-and-white printing is an art that’s slowly dying out commercially, she put her efforts after graduating into making a communal space where old school printers could continue working on their own time and not feel intimidated.,The Darkroom is located in BushBurg, the owners of which also own the loom, that modern office-building looking space near Troutman and Irving. Lucia lives and works doing art out of her apartment and has set up the darkroom in the basement, although one of the purposes of the fundraiser is to move into a larger space! During Bushwick Open Studios I got to check out a small but awesome photography show in the hallway of the building. Lucia says they plan to do more shows in the future, especially featuring work of people who use the community darkroom.,Just for fun I asked Lucia for her favorite spots around Bushwick and she said she loved the Bushwick Starr, which has briefly opens its sleepy doors during CMJ for a handful of shows. She also loves Shea Stadium, which is where the fundraiser will take place TONIGHT. We can’t wait for this darkroom to really take off, and I will be doing a write-up and show-and-tell of one day’s work in the darkroom sometime in the future to show everyone how great the results will be (at least I hope so- I grew up in the darkroom, too, but haven’t printed anything really for a few months!!)

There were a dozen or so interactive art installations, and a high-profile music component featuring headliners Justice, Florence + The Machine, Four Tet, Atlas Sound and more.,Art installations featured a stunning geometric light cube (the focal point of the festival’s public space installation) by the United Artists as well as beautiful and intricate light bending reflective sculptures from SOFTlab called “r&Dazzle.”  Video projects were galore, including a David Bowie-Mick Rock-Barney Clay film, “Life on Mars Revisited,” and collaborative video work from Animal Collective and Black Dice called “Jumbletron.” Interactive pieces included “MED ITATION”  by Minha Yan, a reactive light installation that observers could control through movement and “A PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION OF  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE ARE FLOATING IN SPACE,” (by Jonathan Glazer + J. Spaceman) sound and light room created for the purpose of hearing different elements of sound as specific to pools of light.,The Music portion of the fest surpassed the art segment as far as big names and prestige went. The festival featured three different stages and some really incredible headliners- from digital geniuses Justice to pop superstar Florence + The Machine, subdued and intricate Four Tet, and my personal favorite one-man sound factory Bradford Cox aka Atlas Sound. Also featured were John Maus, Girl Unit, Teen Daze, Yuksek and Queen Sea Big Shark. Justice’s DJ Set (that I considered an actual performance as they were sampling their own work) was mind-blowing, taking place in an old Tobacco Factory, an outdoor brickyard that was overflowing with fans. Too bad the NYPD cut the show in half, demanding the show be shut down due to noise complaints.,Of course, the biggest event of the whole festival is the buzzed-about Stop The Virgens psych-opera written by Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs at St. Ann’s Warehouse. I got to go to the dress rehearsal of the show and adored the music, costumes, and stage presence of the entire cast. The show still has a few dates, feel free to check out more info on the show ,.",strict rule breaker. photographer. music obsessee. brooklynite.,"animal collective,atlas sound,creator's project,DUMBO,florence + the machine,four tet,justice,yeah yeah yeahs","

In the Hood,"I came across this lonely trailer parked on the corner of Bogart and Boerum Streets, when running this morning in the streets of Bushwick. Looking at it closely, I recognized the signs of greenery, which made me immediately feel uneasy. In our home sweet industrial Bushwick, greenery is rather unusual. After I checked with my eyes again, I recognized that I am seeing A Mobile Public Park, a lovely project by artist ,. The sign was saying that I could come in and enjoy the park in the urban setting.  Hesitantly, I entered the trailer, and took 2 deep breaths. I’m not going to lie:  all the oxygen made me feel dizzy, and deprived me of my usual cranky Bushwick balance. In panic, ran back home. Luckily, I passed by a couple huge trucks on Bogart Street, and inhaled fumes from the cars on Flushing Avenue, feeling eventually better…,All photos by the author using an iPhone (the old and crappy one).",,"Bushwick streets,Kim Holleman,Mobile Public Park","

Music,"Three , came together for an all-ages sweat fest at , last Friday.,Openers ,seem to be playing everywhere these days. Show up for a concert early at any Williamsburg haunt, and they’ll be there, jamming away into a soft lo-fi spot somewhere on the floor or ceiling. Well, they’ve definitely been successful in getting their name out there, and for the most part, placing space between this project and the lead singer Cole’s famous main-project, Beach Fossils. Instrumentally, there is enough to sink your teeth into but the vocal tracks never seem to go much of anywhere, unlike the lyrical strengths of Beach Fossils.Their performance was genuine but not too impacting- their music comes alive more in album form., was the band I came to see on Friday! Their lo-fi shoegaze sound is most often dark and murky, yet breathes a layer of pure-pitch clarity. This band is hard to really learn anything about- they’re from Brooklyn, they don’t play too often, they rarely speak up. Their album, , is a fuzzy collection of gems that’s been living in my headphones- a collection of summery uppers and goth-laced downers creating a melancholy middle ground that’s really pretty good. I was honestly underwhelmed by their really short (30 mins?) live set, but what came out of it, including the two songs on their new 7″ , (which you can download over ,), was passionate and sounded on. Never received notice of a line-up change though- the band’s female vocalist and tambourine player was notably absent.,! What could I write that someone hasn’t already penned? Brooklyn-based summer-sheen lo-fi melody chasers (a lot of hyphens) are always fun to listen to and see, unless things get really rowdy, which weirdly tends to happen at their shows. Seeing Beach Fossils is a pretty formulaic experience- these guys have been playing the same handful of great but over-played tracks for a year now. Their fanbase loves to drink whisky from a water bottle and to form a sweat dancepit -which is all good -it just must get tiring after a while…",strict rule breaker. photographer. music obsessee. brooklynite.,"285 kent,beach fossils,dive,minks,music","

The event ran from 5 pm until around midnight and was a huge hit- at times the space was so crowded it was impossible to move!,The Night Bazaar is an extra special add-on to the market, which had already been around, with the addition of 30+ new new businesses. Now the shipping-yard-turned-market features over 50 stores and food places inhabiting the old metal shipping containers. The space looks spiffy and trendy, with the (actually) vintage feel that the old metal housing provides to the stores. The light installations, by ,, were also a nice touch as the sunset faded.,Many different shops have done wonderfully creative things with their allotted space- from light installations to unique paint designs and all-glass fronts. The night was made even better by the special performances of two bands I’m crazy about- Portland’s,and Brooklyn’s own ,.,Not to gush, but ,is really one of the best bands around Brooklyn. I’ve been spinning their LP ,since its release in January and haven’t tired of it yet! To listen is to fall into a cathartic, emotional listening experience. They blend melodic, fall-off-the-bone tender vocals with organic rhythms. I guess the best way to describe their sound is precise- each song perfectly proportioned with intent, not one tangent goes so far as to lose its emotional power. Their sound tends to be minimalist, but it’s never undercooked. It was great to see them performing again, especially with the support of a hyped band like , They performed with passion as usual to an attentive crowd who rocked their hips to Monogold’s oceanic ballads. Catch Monogold play BirdDog Promo’s FREE CMJ show. ,.,- you might have heard about them , but you really can’t begin to understand them until you see them live. Two high-energy, good-looking eccentric Portland weirdos who team up to make spiritual and politically-laden electronic tracks with chantlike, mechanical rhythms. According to the band, Yacht is introduced as “a Band, Belief System, and Business” before delving into a kind of religious ,that encourages creativity from the inner soul. Anyway, peculiar cult-like aura that surrounds the band just adds another level to their music and live performance. This was the second time I’d seen the band and I was just as amazed by the purity of their energy (moonwalking, microphone twirling, stage climbing), the mastery of their stage personas (serious, confident, robotic, and definitely sexy), the quality of their live sound (sometimes apocolyptic and gothic-beated, others hip-sop inspired synth-heavy pop songs)  and the intellectual charm to their stage banter (including dirty jokes, and a tangent by Claire about why women wear lipstick). Playing mostly songs off of their recent album , they pleased the entire crowd into a futuristic, fuzzy, fun frenzy of all-out dancing.

He is wearing a mask when leaning above a young patient in the chair. We are in his orthodontic clinic at Stockholm St. in Bushwick. The boy in the chair points to the blue color when dr. Ploumis presents him a variety of colorful rubbers to be placed in between his braces.,The boy stands up from the chair and dedicates a large grin to my camera. “Those are some cool braces!” I have to admit. “I mean Yo! Braces!”,Dr. Ploumis and his wife, Bushwick’s prominent artist ,, came to Bushwick in 2005. They bought a house at Stockholm St. and remodeled it so that it can accommodate both an artist and a dentist: Deborah works in her studio on the 2nd floor and Dr. Ploumis has a clinic on the 1st floor.,“Thanks to my practice I am meeting different kind of Bushwick people, which is nice,” says dr. Ploumis. “Most of the patients have Medicaid.” The waiting room is full of teenagers, who are cheerful, but they don’t like to be photographed.  I like the name of the orthodontic practice – ,. It’s funny, and plays nicely with the mission of the practice: to offer fun and unique orthodontic experience, which combines personal care and high technology.

I think it is an unusual combination for a dentist to be a lawyer too.  Dr. Ploumis says he wanted to broaden his knowledge, and was interested in law. Currently, he advises in legal matters to other dentists, which he, as a dentist understands the best.  It is interesting how he switches from dental to legal practice; it basically takes him only to take off his white coat and walk into his office in the back of the clinic….,

,This is the story of a baby monster’s love for a human girl. This little girl had super speed vision. She could see individual photons in real time as they were propelled from the sun into the Earth’s atmosphere.,It is not clear whether the little girl ever reciprocated the baby monster’s love. Their relationship was dynamic, the legend says, but little is known of its foundation.,The tale of , is intentionally opaque. Who exactly are the Shiny Pieces? How did they form? And how did they become this dynamic?,~,We are gathered around a table in ,’s recently renovated backyard in Bushwick.  Night has fallen and the air begins to cool quickly. Gillian can’t decide if she is cold or not. I watch her remove and replace her hat for the fifth time.,It’s a curious picture: three cosmically charged pieces at a round table, workshopping each other’s raw material. They feed off each other’s energy, but rather than being destructive, they grow stronger as a unit. The results can be found in their third album, At The Fort Brooklyn, launched just last week in collaboration with ,.,Frank has a theory. “Individually, we are all shiny pieces,” he says, nodding at Gillian and John. “When we combine our powers, we come together. We become Photon Dynamo.”,There is a hum of silence as the group takes this in. This sounds plausible. They nod in agreement.,Each of the shiny pieces can act as a one-man band. “We’re all songwriters. We all put our two cents in,” says Gillian.,While John sticks to drums, Gillian to bass and Frank to guitar, they can all play one another’s instruments and sing. This is uncommon in most bands, they tell me. This way they are less selfish in their songwriting.,A solo artist has just themselves and their guitar to accommodate. A band is comprised of two or more units that must work as one brain. This can become problematic when parts of the band are not considerate of the others.,“I do my best to half-write songs,” says Frank. I don’t question his choice not to one-third-write his songs. A degree of overlap appears necessary, as well as some indulgence.,John tries his best to put every song on the chopping block. He describes himself as a minimalist, which is reflected in his introspective presence at the table.,“I always need to make songs shorter,” he says. “I’m always cutting parts out.”,Gillian pouts. Her songs are usually the longest.,“I bring in a song and he cuts a whole part out,” she laments. “And I’m like, ‘But that’s the part that ties it all together!’”,Although there is occasional head butting, John tells me that the word ‘no’ is a rare utterance at rehearsals. There is no tension between the band mates and they laugh easily at each other and themselves.,“There’s not a lot of ego involved,” Frank says about their process.,I extrapolated the data and made a couple of “scientific” guesses. Perhaps the little girl reciprocated the baby monster’s love. But as luck would have it, such a union was never meant to be. When their dynamic love reached its peak, it exploded into trillions of tiny little light particles. Some became stars. Most blew away. Three little shiny particles, by fate or coincidence, landed in New York City.,The speculation ends there.

,Bushwick’s , will bring an extraordinary real life performance piece opening this Saturday October 8, 2011. Bushwick-based artist , will give birth to her first child in the gallery. As I had about 500 questions about the concept, and about technical execution of the piece, I stopped by at Microscope to chat with Marni.,
Microscope is a small but bold gallery located just behind the popular café Little Skips. When I arrived Marni and her husband Jason were just setting up the gallery space in order to make it suitable for Marni to give birth. “Is it going to be a boy or a girl?” I ask the first question that came to my mind, although I wasn’t planning it. Marni says they didn’t want to know, so for the moment it is just Baby X. “We will name it once it’s born. “ says Marni.,
The gallery looks nothing like I am used to. It looks like a perfect homebirth room. Marni points out to me three important objects: her deceased grandmother’s bed, the rocking chair, her mother rocked her on when she was a baby, and an inflatable birthing pool.,
“Will you give birth in the pool?”,
“Maybe, I will see.” says Marni.,
Marni doesn’t know when exactly the baby will be born. The month-long exhibition is set around her due date, although according to her own words she feels it might happen on the opening night. The gallery will run on extended hours from 11am to 6pm, and Marni will spend some time there every day. She lives just around the corner, so even if it comes in the middle of the night, she can easily come. Marni doesn’t want the crowds to come; it’s also not very practical as the gallery is really small. Marni will be assisted by a mid-wife and doula.,
Marni says that the performers of the 70s, whose pieces were incredibly raw, have inspired her. There is nothing rawer that life itself, and she considers life to be art. Marni previously created performance pieces stimulating moments of her life such as domestic abuse scene, but also her grandfather’s funeral, or loosing of her virginity. During Bushwick Open Studios she would invite people over and make them dinner. Marni says that while those pieces simulated life, the actual birth of a child will be the ultimate performance piece, the real life.,
There is also another aspect to the piece. “Birth is such a beautiful thing, but it is a taboo in our society.” People don’t like to talk about it; they don’t want to see it. “But what can be more magical than seeing a child being born.”,
I have to agree with Marni. It is curious that the reaction of most of my friends, including myself was, that I wouldn’t like to see a birth.,
Marni continues that her hospital experience even shows that it’s hard to give  natural birth, and one third of all women have Caesarean section, which isn’t always necessary and definitely not natural. “In the hospitals, they have birthing tubes, but they don’t use them, because they are afraid that the baby would drown.”,The strong motive of Marni’s performance is to show that natural birth is possible and beautiful.,

,is a free annual One Night Only Light Extravaganza that took place this last Saturday night along the Greenpoint waterfront. The event takes place simultaneously all around the world in connection with other Nuit Blanche events. I personally have been looking forward to this event for about 364 days (since ,, which I also covered) and was so excited to experience a night of enthused hoola-hooping and glowstick-wearing crowds, incredible art installations, and of course, pretty lights.,Nuit Blanche aims to express to create a communal experience by utilizing interactive light exhibitions. According to their website, they accomplished this by “Inviting emerging and established artists to make site-specific installations of light, sound, performance and projection art, the event creates an immersive spectacle for thousands of visitors to re-imagine public space and civic life.”,Nuit Blanche expected 10,000 visitors this year and planned their spaces accordingly. The Festival Center took place at the lovely American Playground Park on Franklin Street and featured several beautiful large-scale pieces. The rest of the festival lined the blocks heading towards the waterfront and sprawled across several warehouse spaces. The park featured one of my favorite installations of the night, the very Dan Flavin-esque “Structural Light” (below) by Jason Peter, a geometric series of interconnected gradient-colored florescent light shapes which seemed to be hanging from branches of the magnificent tree above.,The festival might overstate its goals just a little. As far as reimagining civic life goes, there was little to lead me to drastically respect the other festival-goers with new eyes. However, there was a sort of neon comradare that guided the festival to greatness- an eagerness to see spaces, art, color, and Brooklyn in a new “light.” Others’ excellent costumes also enhanced the experience, from glow-in-the-dark hula hoops and facepaint to full-out body art- I met a very special “Glow Man” who was wearing a suit made of tens of tiny, solar-powered UV lights (below).,All in all, the festival was again a vibratingly beautiful, fantastic experience. Major props to the organizers and artists that make this night very special for thousands of people. Counting the days til Nuit Blanche 2011.

In the Hood,"Bushwick has officially kicked off the art season of the fall 2011! You could tell by the scandalous number of art opening being held almost every day. Walking in Bushwick feels like a never-ending art walk. Here are some impressions from the art-heavy second week of September.,On Wednesday night, ,‘s solo show , was opening in ,. The show featured photographic and video works.,950 Hart is one of the new galleries in Bushwick; for me and many others at the opening  it was the first time there. It was a raining mayhem in Bushwick, but regardless, I undertook to attend, and it was a great decision…!,
,Over at ,, they opened the season with a group show called ,, of video, photographic, and mixed media works, featuring some of their favorite, previously showcased artists. Jonas Mekas, Allison Somers, Nick Zedd, to name a few.,The very first show opened at , at 56 Bogart Street. Look at the pieces that caught my attention.,I gladly accepted the invitation to visit a studio and the home of Bushwick-based artist,, (we featured Mary as a Tuesday Person ,. Mary invited over,, her year-long friend from Italy. As part of Simona’s ongoing studio project, Mary surrendered her studio to Simona for couple of days. Simona told me that this is a studio #3. The first one took place in Italy, when she opened her studio to the public in her home Perugia. She was really excited when I told her that we have a similar, annual ,, when virtually everyone opens their studio to the public. Simona is fascinated by the intimacy of workspace of other people, where you can see their thoughts being transformed into tangible items. She didn’t make any plans about the installation at Mary’s studio, she said she would see. The only thing she brought with her, was a screen to project her own window into the window of Mary Judge.,

,The finale of the acclaimed series of Friday art shows , at , made me a little nostalgic. Well, the summer is over, and so will be the awesome roof deck at 910 Grand Street in October when NURTUREart is moving to the new space at 56 Bogart Street. And however,  the new location will be closer to Bushwick folks and right in the Bushwick art center,  Marco Antonini, a director of the non-profit, sadly admitted there is no roof there…. However, we enjoyed the roof dearly and partied to celebrate all the great work NURTUREart has done there.,

Music,", a post-punk 70s fem band kicked off their North American tour at ,, Greenpoint’s combination rock club-Polish National House, on Saturday. It is the first of six rare shows scheduled to promote the reissue of their sophomore album ,, originally released in 1981.,One-lady act No Bra and three-piece girl band Grass Widow appear earlier on this estrogen-powered bill, with all-girl DJ set Tobi Vail (Bikini Kill) & Amy Yao (Emily’s Sassy Lime) arranged to conclude the night.,Anticipation is running high on the queue outside Warsaw, as the bands spend an extra hour setting up. Emma Casey, 20, is near the front of the line hoping that the doors will open soon.,“There’s nothing like them,” she says about the headlining band. “Their sound is organic. The sound they make on stage is the same as the one they record in the studio.” She finds that this is a rarity among new bands.,Warsaw finally opens its doors once the line reaches the end of the street. A steady stream of people slowly fills the hall. Some head for the bar while others make a beeline for the refreshments room to grab a plate of pierogies before the start of the show.,Sound check begins just as the crowd starts to thicken. A lot of older fans can be seen milling around.,Mark Bourdeau, a college teacher, is so delighted that he nearly hops up and down. He enjoys listening to “thinking person’s music.” This stuff is genuinely quirky, simple and ironic in a way that is not mean, he says.,The Raincoats are a special group to Mark. “They are not a female version of anything,” he says. Other female rock icons of the same era were often compared to other men, like Joan Jett, who was sometimes credited as the female Chuck Berry.,When the ladies hit the stage their energy sends the crowd into motion. A lot has changed since this band’s official start in 1977, but their enthusiasm has certainly not diminished.,“More bass!” someone calls from the crowd after the first song. The Raincoats quickly oblige. They are not hesitant to interact with their fans. As Anne Woods tears into her violin as though it were a guitar, Gina Birch fans the flames in the crowd.,“You ask me if I’m angry? I say, why the hell would I not be?” she cries out. Her question meets an eruption of cheers.,While some of music’s more academic critics worry about equating types of music with sexuality, The Raincoats have an unmistakable female sound. Songs like “In Love” and “No Looking,” Emma says, have ways of reassuring young female fans that other punk sounds do not.,“Yeah that’s what is feels like,” Emma says, referring to the two songs as a set. “Being elated – in love.”,Female fans aren’t the only ones to feel rewarded tonight. As the front of the crowd works itself into a frenzy, one particularly affected young man finds his way onto the stage. The show can be considered a hit at this point.,“You ask me if I’m happy,” Gina sings softly. “I say, why the hell would I not be?”",textual & visual.,"concerts,Mariya Pylayev,music reviews,The Raincoats,Warsaw","

Arts and Culture,". The name comes from a World War I novel ,, by Dalton Trumbo, about a soldier Johnny, who was unable to communicate with the outside world due to the extent of his wounds. In early 2011, war artist , took the name and formed ,, a project that brought together war illustrators and highlighted their drawings of soldiers wounded in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, undergoing rehabilitation…,
,When art writer , was offered to curate his first art show ever at Bushwick gallery ,, he decided to contact Michael Fay, and compile an exhibition from amongst John Bonham Project artists. John Bonham Project comes right in time to commemorate 9/11, and as James says, 9/11 didn’t end for the soldiers who were part of the combat that followed this tragic event of the modern history.,The exhibition opened last Thursday, and coming to Storefront felt different than on other occasions. The familiar space was filled with soldiers in their festive uniforms. Many of them got a special leave from the military, James tells me later.,The art works hanging on the walls are mostly pencil and charcoal drawings; some are black and white; others are colored. Some of the drawings contain also notes of the artist, taken while sketching and interviewing the wounded soldier. You can observe the drawings of soldiers recovering from dismemberment, facial damages…. Looking at the drawings makes me feel a little uncomfortable, but also curious about the stories behind the work.,The greatest attention in Bushwick receives a young marine , and his two pencil portraits of soldiers recovering from facial disfigurement. The execution of the pencil drawing is perfect, and furthermore the faces, despite the injuries, depict a lot of emotion and thought. I look them closer in the eye, trying to understand how someone like that must have felt, expecting maybe a look of a hero who wants nothing but our everlasting gratitude. Or maybe a look of someone excruciated by the fate, which caused him to experience the agony of pain. But all I see is a boy who is a little sad, but dealing with the slow recovery from his injuries, and who can’t wait to go home…,
,Artist Judith Braun and I approach Rob Bates, who smiles humbly, and tells us that that one is nothing, pointing to the drawing.  He says it took him only about 45 minutes to make each of them. “Look at this one,” Rob says, and pulls out his iPhone to show us an amazingly realistic pencil portrait.,“So you’ve been to combat?” Judith asks Rob.,“Yes, ma’am!” Rob answers, and I have to smile. Rob tells us he has been to Afghanistan twice, and currently is serving his last 4 months in the military before he retires. Rob is maybe my age, and I am interested about his further life plans. He wants to go back home to North Carolina, and apply to art school, for an MFA program.,Rob tells us that many galleries and museums haven’t been so welcoming like Storefront. Often, they feel like the portrayed bodies missing limbs are too much for them. But Bushwick, that’s a different story…,The Joe Bonham Project is,on view at , through September 18.,

People," doesn’t like to talk about himself. Blame it on his midwestern upbringing;  He was born in Dayton, Ohio, and grew up with a set of traditional values that did not lend themselves to breeding self-indulgent conversationalists. Lucky for him, his current body of work generously comprised of mixed media and found objects, speaks volumes. With a gentle manner and careful way he chooses his words, Anspaugh is an understated cabinet of curiosities, from the open spaces he knew as a child, to the fury and mania of New York City, where he now resides amidst the blossoming industrial landscape of Bushwick.,Like so many of the young and hungry artist-cum-transplants living in the city, thirty year-old Anspaugh has a lot to say on his family, influences, aspirations and fears. Yet whether waxing philosophic on consumer culture or admitting his hatred for the smell of latex, Anspaugh is just as warm and generous as you might imagine someone fresh from the Midwest to be. But don’t let the quiet reserve fool you; there is a fierce and hotly energetic quality to his work that recalls de Kooning, Twombly, Rauschenberg, and most of all, Basquiat, artists whose influences he candidly owns up to. Surrounded by his works-in-progress and finished pieces, I sat down with Anspaugh in his home studio and spoke about what drives him as an artist, how New York City has served his creative process, and of his upcoming residency in Berlin.,Though attracted to art at a young age – his great-grandmother and mother were both artists – Anspaugh claims music as an early love, rock n’ roll on par with colored pencils and pastels handed to him by teachers all-too aware of his visual talents. Staples of suburban life were The Rolling Stones and Aerosmith, the latter a band which, when seen live, hit Anspaugh in the gut; “I had a profound sense of ‘this is how I want to present myself,’ to connect with people in that way,” he explained. Serving some time in a music band, the experience eventually led Anspaugh back to art. He attended college at the University of Central Florida, which he admitted was a mainly a geographic desire to distance himself from home. “I did have that yearning,” he said astride a stool in his studio, “and I still do, of not wanting to stay put, and it is so hard for me because I want to move on. I struggle with the idea that ‘this can’t be all there is.’ These anxieties were aggravated by Anspaugh’s move to New York City, a place he has never felt truly settled, but nonetheless understands its crucial nature for the life of an artist.,“Everyone in my family told me I was crazy to move to New York,” he laughed. I could imagine. “What are you really going to go, what are you going to do for your job, not just your hobby? Those voices, those negative voices, have given me my inspiration and drive. They are a real source of energy for me.” When I point out the fantastic sense of urban desperation to his pieces, whether scrawled upon, dripping with paint, slashed at, or crumpled that give the viewer an idea of what living in New York is like, Anspaugh admits to his work being consumed by the city. The many layers of ugliness, vibrancy and vitality that blanket day-to-day life oozes freshness at Anspaugh’s hand as he grapples with the experience of the ever-changing and never satisfied. What drew me to his work when I first encountered it at ,, was its’ familiar renderings of playful rage. The grotesque faces, the bright colors, the bold streaks and sheer enormity of some of the pieces were overwhelming to behold, yet strangely pleasing to submit to. For all of its visual violence, there is a dreamy quality to the world Anspaugh depicts; some pieces have you staring down them like the proverbial rabbit-hole, easy to get lost in the swirl of colors and geometric patterns, as nameless faces beg to be read from the sidelines.,These nameless faces abound in Anspaugh’s work, a fertile terrain of primary colors populated with masks of all shapes and sizes. When asking him about this trademark, my initial hypothesis of his obsession and love for masks was dashed when he admitted to having an actual fear of them. “It came from my childhood,” he explained, “this repulsion and fear, especially of latex Halloween masks, and it was an intense emotional experience. I still have the aversion, I can hardly eat during the month of October, but making the masks helps me to focus on it. You can’t ignore that, to find that thing that gives you a life’s work, really. I realized I had something here, and I wanted to move forward.” With this, Anspaugh gives new meaning to ‘face your fears,’ as he has taken that which confuses and repulses him and has confronted it visually to the point of domination.,Yet it is ‘moving forward’ that could be the Anspaugh motto, as his work, much like his mental state, is always striving for that which has yet to be reached. Yet his anxieties stop when taking his current body of work into account; he never feels that ‘you’re only as good as your last piece,’ as he recognizes whatever work came before has indeed led him to the present moment. That present moment is an exciting one, for soon he will embark on a three-week residency in Berlin courtesy of the,Venezuelan American Endowment for the Arts which will give him the much-needed time, space and freedom to create. When I asked him if he had any expectations of the residency, Anspaugh took a moment and said, with a wide grin, “It will get me out of my routine.” I urged him to continue, and his reply betrayed a matter-of-factness courtesy of the midwest; “I’ll walk the streets, experience something new. I’m not expecting it to change my life.”,

Opinion,"After weeks of lazy summer heat, a front of cool autumn air revives the electric current between my neurons and spark my enthusiasm back into the creative rotation of the universe. With that productivity comes a sincere motivation to be productive by false means, such as spending more hours awake. I have had a terrible sleeping schedule all summer, comprised of mostly working after sunset, but this change in climate has only enforced this schedule with ,rationality. Every day I plan to wear myself out earlier than the night before, but perhaps try to hard, as I only burn myself out too early, then have to rest before continuing my plan for the day around the same time that most would be retiring for the night. My thoughts about what more there is left to accomplish in my agenda keeps me awake during these rest periods, while I am too exhausted to actually sustain any level of productivity other than lying down and watching Mad Men or whatever show series is first in my Netflix instant que that month. I have tried valerian root, melatonin, red wine, food comas, and alternately – jogging. The result is either I feel too good to waste it on sleep, I feel too full to lie down, or too energized to sit – respectively.,Sometimes I make the mistake of throwing stimulants into the mix…,Late night espressos at Goodbye Blue monday, loosies [loose cigarettes bought individually - for those of you new to the black market of Brooklyn tabacco], and Chateau Diana “Wine Product” from Mr. Kiwi – sold all hours of the night due to its low alcohol content.,…and end up sitting on my new stoop with my new toy, taking photos of green things before their time of decay, against this concrete sunrise.,▲▲▲▲▲▲▲",,"Curious Wednesday,ms. marquise","

In the Hood,"There is an event in Bushwick that combines learning, community, conversation and drinking in magnificent fashion. That event is Presentation Party Night and it just celebrated it’s one year anniversary.,PPN—as it’s loyalists lovingly refer to it—is a free lecture and beer series held on the third Sunday of every month at 7pm, usually in an apartment on Jefferson Street. It’s potluck style food and BYOB with donations encouraged for a group beer fund. The evening consists of six 10-minute presentations on whatever topic the presenters choose (be it nerdy, bizarre or both) followed by a question and answer period.,And that Q+A is where the fun really begins.,Because that’s when a group discussion takes off where people engage, ask questions, shout their opinions and spark intense debates and hilarious conversations.,At the most recent PPN—aside from the amazing food—there was history, there was art, there was jokes, there was absurdist fiction, there was “adventures with silicone” and the last presentation was on the past, present and future of PPN itself.,Begun by Dan Dreke with assists from Drew Weigel, Joe Gillette and many others, PPN has grown over it’s inaugural year into one of those consistently fun and unpredictable happenings.,There is a core group of friends and acquaintances that show up each month as well as various newcomers that may only attend once but always make for a great crowd. The variety of topics also keep the energy going throughout the night. Sometimes a theme emerges, sometimes a party does.,One of the best things about it is you never know what you’ll learn. Some of my personal favorite topics from past PPNs include “The Upside of Pessimism,” “How to Hit It, Quit It, and Split It (Like You Never Did It),” “The Life and Work of Alexander McQueen,” “How to Survive the Apocalypse,” “A History of Video Game Storytelling,” “The Two Sides of L. Ron Hubbard,” “Kennings,” “Neurobiology of Opiate Tolerance,” “Who Let ‘Who Let the Dogs Out’ Out: Intellectual Property Rights,” “Taxonomic Creeperisms” and everyone’s holiday favorite, “The Christmas Krampus.”,I am friends with the group who runs this excellent affair and have presented twice myself (Decision Making and Carrie Nation) and along the way, I’ve discovered a few things:,1. Anyone can present. Everyone is an expert on something—some random topic—that they are passionate about. And that’s all it takes to give a good presentation. And failing that, Wikipedia works too.,2. Don’t force it or over think it. What do you love? Obscure sports? Guerilla knitting? Arrow’s Impossibility Theorum? Do it. Don’t worry if you think no one is interested. They will be. People will respond. Add jokes and people will laugh. Enthusiasm is all that matters.,3. Don’t even worry about taking up 10 minutes. Some of the best presentations are really more like propositions. The crowd will then take over and the discussion/debate that ensues is where the real wisdom emerges. That’s why a good presenter—like a good artist or philosopher or scientist—is simply one that knows how to ask the right questions.,And PPN is always in need of new presenters as well as potential spaces to hold the event. So if you think you have an idea, give ‘em a shout. And if you deicide to stop by, I’m sure you’ll agree with the hope that this thing lasts well into the future.,http://ppn-nyc.blogspot.com/","Chris is a professional designer, organizer and list-maker.","BYOB,Chris Heuberger,Presentation Party Night","

Opinion,"“I can’t hear the X’s, can you turn up the squares?”,It occurred to me in my third year out of college, after receiving my appropriately titled BS degree in “Organizational and Political Communications” that people will infrequently be able to read your mind. While we may have progressed over a very long period of time from non-verbal to oral and then to written languages, our thoughts often times are hardly any more complex than our ancestors. That is to say, by , we really ought to have figured out how to communicate telepathically. In the last half century and longer there have been comprehensive and , accounts of astral projection, telepathy and distance healing which unfortunately was allotted to a select stereotype of spiritual mediums and enlisted by those of catholic and christian faiths to the army of satanist witches.,Now that we have established that your friends and bosses are not psychically intuitive, nor are inclined towards developing a loving relationship where you live inside each other’s heads, , we can safely say that communicating will forever be one of humanities greatest tragedies. Where a lack of communication can build suspense and drama keeping us feeding – pacified by the tubes of entertainment, conversely it can single handedly crumble empires and affairs of Roman magnitude.,When locked away in a dark cave as I often am, to utter a single note – let alone one of protest or opposition, can seem daunting. “Why rock the boat?” they say; “Why live if you don’t?” proclaim others. I could argue that my four year college education was useless and stand behind silence speaking volumes because it happens to be true, but it would be more true to say that a calculated silent pause in the middle of a well-delivered rhetoric can speak to the hearts of millions and simply change the world.,So please, get off your ipad and learn how to speak – these last two generations need a coherent voice.,▲▲▲▲▲▲▲",,"Curious Wednesday,ms. marquise","

I am suddenly reminded of the inevitable arrival of fall, soon. , and I are taking a little walk in the closeness of his studio at Hart St. Cooper’s studio is in an old factory, which is hidden, a bit surprisingly, between the residential buildings. This is Bushwick.,Cooper is one of the Bushwick artists, proudly creating collage, and he says that it’s the perfect medium for the times we live in. Earlier in his studio he pulled out a bunch of cuttings from magazines and papers for his next project. Right now his studio is rather empty; good empty- most of his work is hanging in galleries., is his solo show at Bushwick’s Storefront. Cooper who is originally from Detroit says that he grew up hearing how things in Detroit used to be perfect before, and now are not anymore. He is coming from the environment where fathers worked in factories believing that their children will once be executives there; families owned Herman Miller furniture in their vinyl-sided houses… “Capitalist Utopia,” says Cooper. “It never existed.” His show at Storefront is a gentle mockery of the loyalty to the American middle class lifestyle of the 20th century and it’s values.,“How do you like people in New York?” I’m asking. “Are they different than people in Detroit?”,
“Oh my god! They are very different. People in Detroit are nice. And polite!” He is laughing. “But people in Bushwick are a very different story. People here are really nice.” I concur.,“Snow cones!” Cooper stops a snow cone vendor, after I’m being curious about what he enjoys in Bushwick. Cooper spent quite some time in South America, in Chile and in Brazil, and maybe that’s where he became addicted to this simple treat. The vendor lifts a towel from a piece of ice, and proceeds to scratch it only to get two cups full of snow. Cooper knowledgably points his finger to the bottle containing lemon juice and the vendor pours it on two cups, and inserts a straw into each of them. “One’s for you,” says Cooper, and I am thinking “Oh, shit. I didn’t notice if the ice was clean.” But it’s time to loosen up and enjoy some local treats. The lemon juice is bitter and intensively sweet.,“You know how in New York, even if you go to a bar by yourself, someone will talk to you even if you don’t know them.” Cooper continues in our discussion about people. ”So in Finland that would never happen. People there seemed pretty cold. Unlike Swedes who were really friendly.” Cooper seems like he’s happy everywhere, and I’m guessing he was also pretty happy in Europe where he spent some time at an art residency. His artistic path has been quite interesting so far. He started as a political science major ready to take the LSATs, but eventually ending up taking so many art courses, he received also an art degree.,He sips his lemon juice because the snow has melted.","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

It allows you to see what’s going on up close, smell the smells, hear the sounds and catch the photo ops.,You can’t cover as much ground walking than you can by bike or car though, so running is the way to go, allowing maximum flexibility and freedom. Not to mention it’s a decent workout.,Of course, I’m a runner and actually enjoy this sometimes grueling activity. So for anyone not so inclined, you can still experience the highlights with me now.,The route is your basic loop, 8 miles beginning and ending at my apartment. Like a sort of urban obstacle course, it includes long, uphill straight-aways early on and then shorter block zig zags towards the end, trying to hit any parks I could along the way. I’m pretty sure at some point I was technically in Ridgewood but for any fellow Bushwick runners, I recommend it to get a good sense of the variety in this part of town. Some stretches were through wide open industrial sections, some through denser residential areas and the last mile went right through the new Bushwick Artist Market on Bogart. I strayed off course quite often when something grabbed my interest but this map shows the general path. The numbers indicate roughly where each photo was taken.

,Biking down to the studio of ,, I felt like I have more questions that information. Mathew lives right above ,, which used to be ,, he adds immediately as if he wanted to underline the sanctity of what used to be a legendary art pop-up gallery lead by ,.,Matthew Miller is a likable peaceful guy, polite, and friendly who never speaks too much nor too little. He likes to go out to see the art shows in Bushwick. With his conservative look, he is nothing like a Bushwick hipster, actually quite to the contrary; he likes to wear dress pans with dress shoes, and a simple white t-shirt.,As I lock my bike and follow him up the stairs to his studio, I can’t wait to see how and if his newest works changed since the huge wave of media interest in Matthew’s person. Virtually every prime art publication in the country rushed to review his recent solo show at ,, a DIY gallery developed in the basement of a Ridgewood house. Matthew opens the door of the a small neat studio, which serves also as a bedroom; the air-conditioner is silently buzzing, cooling off the space to the perfect temperature, the floor is wiped clean, the books are straighten in a bookshelf. Matthew probably noticing my surprise excuses the perfectly clean room by saying that he can’t paint in a mess. After reading about Matthew’s work in , I was expecting, maybe a little bit more of fanciness, but I received a portion of Bushwick reality where artists are leading double lives, the first life, the necessary one at a day job from 9 to 5; then the second one in the evenings and early mornings, creating, planning, showing in galleries, being reviewed by ,.,One entire wall is covered with brown paper, but not a single drop of paint has touched it. That’s Matthew’s painting area. Wood panels are leaning against the wall; one of them is being worked on. It is a painting of Matthew’s head on the black background, not dramatically different from the 8 self-portraits exhibited at Famous Accountants. “This one has the nose sticking slightly to the side, I have never painted it like that, so it’s interesting.” Matthew says. I feel like I am slowly exploding with questions: Why the black background? Why the self-portraits? What emotions, are if any are the heads going through? And lastly what is the message he’s trying to convey?,“Technically, it’s not a black background.” Matthew starts patiently. “It’s more like a space to stimulate one’s imagination. It’s like looking into an open door against bright sun. You know that there are things inside of the door, but you can’t see any. Just like the name of the Famous Accountants show: ,”,Matthew continues to shatter my previous ideas about the motives behind his work. “In fact, I don’t like to look at these as at self-portraits. They are not personal. I just used my face, because that’s the face I know the best. So it’s just a person who looks like me. ”,I am happy to discover that Matthew doesn’t always paint only portraits of himself; he shows me a portrait of a black guy, and a golden-haired woman, both painted the same way, on a wood panel with a black background. Matthew explains that he didn’t show these alongside the portraits of himself at Famous Accountants, because it could mislead the viewer even more, who would then might have been tempted to think about who are those other people, and what is the relationship between them and Matthew. Matthew says that that’s absolutely not the way he wants to go, and that he is only interested in exploration of portraiture, and the interaction of the viewer and the painting. He purposely paints his portraits with a neutral face expression, which according to him stimulates viewer’s imagination way more than a particular emotion, however strong it might be. “Every one knows that it’s not just a painting, not a person they are looking at. You can’t enter their space for example.”,“Aren’t you scared that your subconsciousness might ruin this pure portrait exploration, and bring in something you wouldn’t expect. Like an emotion?” I am curious. “No, subconsciousness is welcomed. ” Matthew says with a smile.","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

Arts and Culture,"Bushwick-based artist and musician ,, a Bushwick Daily’s Tuesday Person eventually gets impressed by performance art at festival , in Sammatti, Finland, he had visited this in July 2011.,
,It all starts with a duck, and as I am told a small duck at that. Some insist that it was an eagle, but I doubt that. Would an eagle dive to the bottom of the watery nothingness that existed before anything, and pluck up a bit of mud in its bill to create an island that would become the nesting ground for the egg that would break open, and create the cosmos: the bottom half becoming earth and the other sky?,Eagles- Fuck all y’all, this clearly is duck territory!,So begins the world according to the ,, the sacred text of the oral traditions of the Finish Lapland shaman.  The Kalevala was compiled by philologist, Elias Lönnrot (1802-1884), who was born and spent his childhood in a small cottage called Paikkari, built on the grounds in Sammatti, Finland that served this summer as the site of the festival of Performance Art. The Festival was a few hours drive from Helsinki into the beautiful countryside, where at night in late July, the stars shine, and the sky becomes the deepest shade of blue, but still the sunset never ends…,I have rarely considered performance art to be more than an amusing diversion, but this event with it’s gorgeous natural setting and the artists’ rich and diverse reinterpretations of tradition, made me think of performance, with it’s insistence on its own transience as of a continuation of something ancient and mythic, when magic and rituals sought to exercise change in a world where normal actions often fell short.,
,The day of diverse performances began with tradition: a shaman recited ancient words for the benefit of us all, in a language that is no longer spoken, the sounds that make the thing, a place where the signified speaks it’s own sign.  From then on it was a free range of media and ideas.  The works often made use of humor. Then laughter would often turn to contemplation of poetic melancholy. It was evident that the artists were set on injecting contemporary relevance into their inspiration from the ,.,
,What really amazed me about the Paikkari Performance, was the crowd. New York has made me accustomed to “performance art” events where the audience is composed mostly of participants. Here the audience was full of children and families. From my brief stay there I gained the impression that I had never been in a society who has so integrated the ideas of the historical avant-garde…,I think that all artists should visit Finland. Even if it is only to consider if this is a world they would want.,

Paul authored all three parts of the story, the main character of which is You;  read it; composed the music to enhance the effect of this ‘almost cataclysmic’ story; and his buddy musician Roarke Menzies recorded and mixed it. The first two parts were released in June and July, and the final installment is prepared for August.,“The You Trilogy is kind of a social experiment…” says Paul while turning on his keyboard. “Originally, I wanted to release it on a record, but Roarke persuaded me that an online release would be better. Now I want to see how far an audio play like this can reach. Its length is also important; it’s not a 5-minute long play. Every part is 30 minutes long. ”,I’m convinced that Paul must be a great musician taking into account how sensitively he composed the music to most of his audio achievements. Paul protests, insisting that he only has this huge keyboard, and sometimes he presses a button here… and a button there, and a couple of keys like this….and suddenly… “Oh, do you recognize? This is the bossa nova background music from The Game, the first part of The You Trilogy.” asks Paul clearly entertained by the musical part. Paul explains that music is a very powerful tool to accompany a text. “Maybe even too powerful….” Paul makes a mystical face.,Another artifact in Paul’s proud possession is a 90s cassette player. “I got it from a friend, it was just sitting on a shelf, and she thought it doesn’t work.” Paul is rewinding a cassette. “But it does, and actually I used it during the Bushwack Series at The Bushwick Starr.”,Paul’s fascination with audio formats comes from his childhood, when his parents used to listen to plays on the radio. He says he didn’t like radio plays back then; it was only a bit later when he started to specifically write compact pieces to be read out aloud. Theater plays are too complicated. You need to many people, too many resources… it’s a way serious thing.,By day Paul works at Wycoff Starr, and by night he writes, composes or records. Paul’s readings became largely visited, because of how close to a performance they actually are. Paul’s reading is very engaging – he’s cracking up he’s a wannabe actor – and the music and sound effects just won’t let you detach from the story. But Paul insists that every good writer reads well: “They just have the sound of the story in their head….”,.","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

In Prague, she would spend 20+ hours in a ballet room, training contemporary and experimental dance, and all she had all of sudden was, a tiny railroad apartment… She nearly exploded, and was determined to find a place to dance at any cost.

Opinion,"Those who know me can , attest to the fact that I will do something if you can prove to me, that I want to do it. In fact, I think the world at large functions based on this principle of persuasion. Yesterday I, as well as a number of my professional colleagues received an email offer from a young man, to consume a significant, but small portion of his flesh. My initial response was, “What?”, ,, I simply did not undersand what he was asking for. Due to this, my second response was, “You better call me right now, because I am not wasting another minute of my time looking up these terms!”, which I was actually doing immediately after sending my response. Unfortunately, my web browsing was simultaneous with his email checking, and my phone rang the second my eyes hit the sentence containing the words “long pig” in ,.,I picked up my mystery call, hoping against hope, but knowing, that the man on the other end of the proverbial line, would not be the one who wanted to be eaten. My hope , fell short – it was him.,My general rule for phone calls is it must be under 3 minutes, or the client is clearly taking advantage of my time. However, due to this inexplicable fantasy, and my endless quest for knowledge and proof of freudian psychological theories, this phone call ended one long hour later, with me laughing – and stupefied. He had answers to questions I had no time to pose, which with him being a lawyer, mostly consisted of a legal approach to the situation which can only be categorized as consensual, and non-fatal.,The outcome was for me to meet with him, weekly, for about a year, in order to further explore his quest – to be eaten. These meetings, and my time would , be compensated as to not feel cheated if in 4 months or so I found him distasteful ,; this I explained using the argument: “Who wants to eat a jerk?” I surprised myself at having such sound points to my debate, as juvenile and amateur as they must have sounded to a legal professional who had written his senior undergrad thesis on his particular fantasy being a covert, worldwide practice ,! Our first meeting was arranged for tomorrow ,, but true to his values – and my promise – where monetary compensation is considered secondary to our mutual goal, I decided to forgo what would would have been a paid hour of my time spent with him, in favor of yoga – which I thought would bring some balance to my recent choices in occupation. Our first meeting is pending to be rescheduled, and so is the outcome. SUSPENSE and maybe some terror.,Stay tuned.,▲▲▲▲▲▲▲",,"Curious Wednesday,ms. marquise","

Thick fat raindrops here and there should have been a warning enough before this summer mayhem.,“This won’t last more than 20 minutes.” Ty says. “It took me a while to figure out New York summer rain. But it’s always like that.” California surfer continues.,Ty halfway closes the large gate of his studio, and covers up a dresser made of smooth massive wood, his latest commission, so that the intense rain doesn’t damage it.,Dry Bushwick dust mixes with the water pouring from the sky and creates distinctive summer smell; I hug my knees, finding a seat on an upholstered chair, while Ty lights up his welder to finish the works on some kind of an iron component.,Ty’s studio is filled with artifacts of all kinds: from a Snow white’s dwarf, to screws, pipes, and plastic cups of all sizes. A big caste recorder in the corner is producing strange installation of sounds. Ty likes to listen to an experimental college radio. He says that sometimes they play songs, but he prefers strange sounds in the background, he doesn’t need a tune.,Ty says that ever since he remembers, he has been collecting strange things and peculiar objects. Back in California, he would fill up his vintage car with found objects, like bottle cups of different colors, figures, or shells…  Ty uses his skills to assemble bigger and smaller objects together creating unexpected shapes and sculptures.  He encourages me to climb up an iron shelve on the wall, and take a look at his studio from the s bird’s-eye view. Ty explains he loves to look at the studio from above. I take couple of pictures. It’s strange to see his huge sculpture that just recently dominated Vandervoort Pl. as part of the ,, so closely. The sculpture looks a little trapped in between four walls of Ty’s studio. We both agree that that the sculpture needs to breathe and looks better on the street.

Moreover, he is an incredibly skilled craftsman. We’re walking through an apartment connected to Ty’s studio. Ty has furnished it with objects he has made of metal, steel and wood: level bed, kitchen sink, and solid wooden shelf firmly holding on the wall….,Just like Ty said the tropical Bushwick rain magically stops after 20 minutes; the air is fresh and instantly warm; the rays of light reflect from a wet bamboo palm in his backyard…","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

In the Hood,", a director of ,, ,, presents a kaleidoscopic portrait of the organization through 10 compact art exhibitions, to open every summer Friday, starting tomorrow with Ivan Argote.,Marco explains that shortly after he was hired by NURTUREart as a director early this year, he was challenged with the planning of the sequel to the  Bushwick Biennal. Two years ago NURTUREart threw more of a macro event, a survey of Bushwick, and its art spaces. Marco wanted to change the format, and instead of asking ,, to ask ,t,  as an organization. The poster for the show is an empty template saying: , to be filled out by the participating artists.,10 summer weeks, that is 10 summer Fridays night openings at NURTUREart. Every week there will be some one else. Marco says that it’s like an identity game played with artists, curators, and other organizations. NURTUREart is hanging over the keys to these people and will let them speak for them. Each of the Friday shows will be completely original. Marco sees , more like a festival than a series of traditional shows. He uses the word workshop a  lot.,The gallery will be open to the public already on Thursday, on the day before the opening. The public can come in and see the installation in progress, as NURTUREart belives that it’s important to see the hands on the work.,The only connecting factor of the 10 shows is diversity. NURTUREart pledged to show the panorama of the art being created in New York; to present an idea in a nutshell: going from crazy, odd or weird, to conceptual, minimal, and hyper-educated.,The shows are very improptu, the budget for one traditional NURTUREart show was split into 10. Marco says that it will be an outlet for creativity.,When you go to NURTUREart tomorrow (or even today) make sure to grab one of the brochures. The brochures were produced in Berlin, by a machine called RISOgraph, which uses color soya beans. The machine is completely cold, and uses 95% less energy than normal machine.  It’s hand-bound, and each one is a little different than the other.,The list of invited artists, curators and organizations includes:,

Opinion,"A middle school friend once quoted most likely something her older sister once said, “moving is only second in stress, to childbirth.”,I never understood that statement to be true, however at this moment in time, it find that comparison to be particularly valid. Allow me to elaborate on my personal experience of the last 2 weeks; moving is like dating – minus the sexy time. Like… dating because you are old, lonely and want to have babies, right now. Not fun dating because you want to experiment with multiple partners. Even my roommate, who too is looking to acquire a new place a residences, confronted our first housing mistress by telling her it felt like he was on a blind date all of a sudden, to which she replied that it felt more like speed dating to her. [Luckily neither my roommate, nor I have experience enough to confirm or deny her opinion].,Every time I find a seemingly perfect location online and inquire, I find out it’s unavailable. Just when I think I think I have found a perfect location, it’s much too distant. When you think you have found something reasonable, a gem in the rough, you find out it’s cheap for a reason. The five floor walk ups, the half mile hike to the subway, the perfect pair of floor that’s just too deep in the ghetto, the second bedroom that’s just a glorified closet. Is this a good analogy for why gals go back to their abusive boyfriends? I never thought I would say 8.5 of these 9 words in the same sentence, but: I just want to settle down with someplace nice. Is this old abusive, cheap, gorgeous, bastard of a home really all that bad? All I have to do is think of the heating bill [that's right folks, I am forced to pay my own heat] and I become re-inspired to hit the field again; to pick up the old shovel and start digging through all the bullshit once again, hoping this time I don’t get stood-up, double crossed or in a fight with a hasid.,▼▼▼▼▼▼▼,This column has been brought to you by: Detox Yogi tea and a lemon sugar cookie, both from Mr. Kiwi, which I will miss much if I must leave the neighborhood.,▲▲▲▲▲▲▲",,,"

People,"“Enough of the hypothetical duck talk,” I said, and ,raised his eye-brows. It was one of the Bushwick gallery nights, and we were slowly melting our intellectual gallery experience immediately preceding this moment, in one of the number of kinds of the Six Point beer.,Eric is probably , in Bushwick, known for his ,, ,, ,, ,, and as of lately, well, because of ,….,Thanks to the super cool ducks that Eric has been painting lately, he received ,of ,, maybe even a bit too much, because now he might be expected to have commited to this specific poultry kind…  ,“What if I want to paint something other than ducks?” says Eric in a short moment of hesitation when we’re walking on Broadway towards the,, the only place with real ducks in Bushwick, as far as I know. But the hesitation dissolves quickly, because Eric is pretty excited about all the props that he’s carrying in his backpack. He has a loaf of bread, cookie cutters, yellow rubber ducks, and a stick, to which I refer as a Gandalf stick, but Eric dismisses this reference with an annoyed ‘pff’. Eric is planning a sacred duck ritual at the farm, he says he has a vision that he will cover himself up with strangely cut out pieces of bread, and the ducks will eat the bread off him. I am cracking up because of the reference to last week’s article about ,, but I am also a little concerned, because there are only 2 ducks at the farm and about a million of shameless chickens…,At the farm, both of the aforementioned ducks are chilling in the shade, not caring too much about what’s going on around them; they only make an annoyed , whenever a chicken tries to drink from their water. Eric’s eyes sparkle when he realizes that his totem animal is a little aloof, just like in his paintings. Masha from the farm, however, strictly forbids us to feed the ducks any bread, because it’s not good for them, she says. She suggests we give them bananas. Also it’s starting to be pretty clear that we’re not getting rid of the chickens any time soon. They are following us around as we’re following around the ducks; and furthermore, Silky, a white, innocent-looking Chinese rooster attacks Eric. Eric says that it was a charming attack indeed, and Masha explains that Silky had so much sex lately with all the chickens, and now he thinks he’s the shit. Generally, there is way more fuzz and chaos among the poultry than normally, and many of them have large featherless parts on their bodies. It seems like there were some kind of riots going on. Eric inquires about this with Masha, who promptly responds that spring caused the roosters to be over-sexing the chickens. “Mainly the fat ones,” she says. “We had to isolate all the roosters except Silky.” Eric asks me to specifically mention the chicken sex riots in this article., , , , ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

People,"“I’ve always had this fantasy!” says ,as I am closing a small gate entering her small brown house in Williamsburg. The air is hot and steamy; it stopped raining only minutes ago. The Brooklyn flora absorbed the moist hastingly, as if it knew that the upcoming months will not bring anything else than hot wind and burning concrete. The summer in Brooklyn is approaching quickly.,“I want my paintings all over myself, all over the place. Everywhere!”, says Julie with a sparkle in her eye. She is explaining on the porch, and as we’re walking up her stairs. I’m thinking that the concept is perfect; it matches with the exact precision Julie’s personality. Julie makes abstract paintings in vibrant colors; she’s quick and paints in the heat of the moment, inspiration being her fuel and radiation of energy a necessary by-product.,Julie’s living room is a joyful and creative mess. Tubes of paint, paint brushes, sketch books, sheets of paper, and hundreds of paintings painted on all kinds of materials, like a piece I pick painted on an envelope…,Julie and I begin to hang the paintings on the ceiling, and to spread them on the floor, creating a projection of Julie’s inner world in her living room. “I only want to make paintings. And look at paintings” I remember Julie once telling me.,Thousands of threads of paint have dried dripping on the wall where Julie paints.,She started to hang out in Bushwick about a year and half ago and barely missed a single art opening. “Since I came to Bushwick, everything changed. I found friends. And community. I know I can’t go wrong, I can’t fall, because they won’t let me. And it may sound like a cliché, but that’s something I’ve never had before. I finally feel like I belong somewhere.” says Julie. “I am incredibly thankful for that.”,Julie is sitting on the floor, just starting a new painting. She makes two blue lines, than goes for some yellow and red. I’m asking her to pose a little, but she says I have to wait because this looks like a good one.,Being with Julie feels like recharging your creative energy. The air she’s surrounded with, buzzes, I swear. She has organized and curated a number of notable events and creative-people-get-togethers. Like the ,a couple of weeks ago at the Hyperallergic headquarters. She was painting for 24 hours aiming to make 100 paintings. The first 100 visitors got a free piece. She will be doing ,for Northside Open Studios, and will paint for 5 hours this Sunday from 12 to 5 at India Street.,Recently, Julie came to the attention of public thanks to organizing an informal ‘drink ‘n’ draw’ sessions throughout the course of 9 weeks and bringing together 45 artists. These sessions resulted in 100 collaborative and experimental pieces and a big art party at ,during Bushwick Open Studios. The show is called “So Happy Together” and the pieces are still on sale for as little as $ 50, thus making art accessible even to a regular Bushwick resident. You should definitely check out the ,at Norte Maar on June 26.","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

Opinion,"“Though dreams can be deceiving, like faces are to hearts, they serve for sweet relieving, when fantasy and reality lie too far apart.”,Fiona Apple’s lyrics rang in my ears on so many mornings when waking, it became a sort of intro anthem to my morning rituals, setting off the reset of the day in a comfortable fog of yearning to be back in my other worlds where I live out my tumultuous and often confusing dreams.,I have tried to understand where my dreams lie; if they are truly lucid, or if they if I just have dream control. As it seems my dream self acts within the dream world as I act within mine – with total understand and comprehension that nothing is as it seems and that reality is fluid, forever changing like layers of marbled pigments suspended between water and oil, shifting within a million currents.,In the last year, I have gone so far as to put on makeup in a kiosk mirror at an outdoor beauty pageant, pick the lint off the shoulder of my anonymous lover, convince club kid party scenesters I am relevant via my fat friend who is Marilyn Manson or 19 year old Rick Owens. But the worst is when everything is going swimingly in the dream, and I wake up to pee or take a phone call, go back to sleep and bring back a piece of waking rationality or consciousness. All of a sudden, I have ethical dilemas to face and emotional heralds to leap – logistics just don’t line up anymore. I struggle on for an hour or two, certain I can fix this sudden turn in events, but I never can. I wake up just a touch frustrated, knowing I had let a litteral dream slip right through my fingers. I stagger through reality thinking on how I can secure it next time, but in real life. After all, I just had it close enough to touch, smell and taste.,Lucid dreaming, the ultimate tease.,[ In my searches for answer I found , cute tests for dream control.

Opinion,"Despite my early intrigues in not only BDSM and fetishism, but also borderline vanilla fantasies , I had little desire to explore the visual world of pornography. It is true that I occasionally had fantasies of creating it, starring in it, distributing it , but never in the studio feature sense. Every time I would see deemed pornographic in nature, I would first be disgusted by the blatant display of the human body with little thought as to lighting, concept or artistic integrity that is the human form. Then, after my eyes were drawn back to the image like curiosity to a car crash, I would study the image or images before me, waiting for the arousal that never came. Soon I would grow bored, and occasionally sleepy, exhausted by the tease and denial of something many others come to experience when absorbed in the viewing of naked bodies hovering on the edges of cheap wood prop desks or grinding together at the hips on a hotel bed. As my trial and error methods wore on, I noticed how many of the higher budget features employed actresses who were so tan, bleached and plumbed with silicone, they hardly resembled human bodies. Still, there were a couple diamonds in the rough. Last Tango In Paris , and Cafe Flesh , where two stables in my scant library of tolerable fantasies. But who can sit through so much conversation and plot when they just need some late night inspiration?,I started looking through the backs of old forgotten video rental stores, and stopping at Luv Boutique on my way through Connecticut. I was on a mission to get something raunchy, yet captivating. “‘Clown Fuckers BIG DICK get on the party bus! get ready to enter the FREAKSHOW,’ seemed like a really good option” said the sales rep , “I wouldn’t recommend the sequel” she commented as my glanced bounced between the two DVD covers. Had I looked at the bottom right hand corner of the case, I would have noticed that there are 4hrs of entertainment contained on this single disk. NO ONE can sustain a plot for 4hrs when it involves sex ,The first scene was great, low budget and simple ,. I thought the zombie cave man really brought it together.,The second scene was a little less creative, but equally as imaginative. With a fantasy lover appearing before the girl, soon turning into evil doppelganger robot with blue ooze/lube for brains that he kept smearing the girl with. It was definitely more on the humiliation side of role play.,The third scene was some younger girl with an older balding dude that maybe was supposed to be her dad, an older lady with a strap on and white face paint that was definitely and convincingly supposed to be her mom, and a forth character who appeared while I was fast forwarding. It was less sexy than it was disturbing.,After this last , , scene, the next 3hrs of fornication turned into 8 vignettes, all following the same layout : intro,, oral, vaginal, anal, facial. I forward through all of them, figured I might have missed some strange verbal sentiments and spot checked the scenes front to back once again. Despite my totally sleepy and misanthropic state, I began to relate to these amateurs with bad skin, piles of makeup, small breasts and shapely figues. In them, I saw my middle school self, unconfident, shy, and excited to have really boring sex. I wish I had given porn a shot back then. To know that underneath the clothes and attitude we all look quite similar, would have given me great confidence back then. I wish the government wouldn’t prohibit our basic privilege to know we are all the same.,Exercise of the week: make a porn, give it to a friend. ,▼▼▼▼▼▼▼,This week’s column was brought to you by:,

We are right beside the  coffee shop Little Skips.,We are an art space devoted to film and video makers, sound, performers and other time-based artists. We present month-long exhibitions and a twice-a-week event series of screenings, performances and music shows from emerging to internationally recognized artists, including those we represent. We are always, however, seeking new discoveries, and accept submissions.,Yes, we are!  Our gallery is open all three days from 1-6PM.  Our current exhibit is “SU FREDRICH re:working”. This is Friedrich’s first gallery show, but she’s been making films for 37 years and shows them worldwide  The show reveals the work behind the work. She started as a photographer. The exhibit includes all these early photographs that she hasn’t shown before,  her work journals where she details every single frame, things she made as props, these beautiful new black & white filmstrip prints, digital collage from her recent videos,and films of course. There are over 175 works on the walls. Very different than our other shows.,Also, we’ve curated a film festival. One night at an opening here, Tara Ferri came in and asked if we wanted to organize a film festival for BOS 2011 in connection with her Music Festival. And we said, “Sure”.,
And here we are. It’s this weekend, the first BOS Film Festival.  We are presenting 5 programs of films, video & performance each day, starting at 6PM – SHARP – to 10. We’ve got some great artists and all the programs are free. It’s in the Backroom at Goodbye Blue Monday. The full program and other details are available at:   ,.,
We’re not really brunch people. We usually get very hungry around 7pm, and we run to the little grocery deli just around the corner on Myrtle for tacos, vegetable (w/ cactus!) or beef.

And I confirm. Mainly because there ain’t any…. Yet…,However, Ad, as the master mind behind the idea of Bushwick Art Park, is promising some greener times pretty soon. Ad has been intrigued by an under-used street right behind Factory Fresh, for quite some time now.  On Saturday June 4th, as part of ,, Vandervoort Place will be turned into a street-inspired public art park featuring statues of acclaimed Brooklyn artists.,The prototype art park curated by ,director Ali Ha, was introduced earlier in May at The Festival of Ideas for the New City StreetFest.,It’s funny that you mention that… If you go to the history section of ,, you will see the house where my brother Droo and I first moved to. It was a crooked building in Queens that we called ,, simply because it was crooked.  It was right this color scheme: brigh orange, red, green, kinda bodega style. We collected a lot of toys and vintage items, because we liked that style. When people come down here (,), they see that this place is sort of a replica of the crooked house in Queens. Many items are from there: the clock, the soda, the drawers.,People soon started to say:  “We’re hanging out at Skewville, come to Skewville, …” This is how everyone was referring to the building…. Droo and I both quit our jobs to start our own accessories company with t-shirt, and smoking paraphernalia, and we named the company so Skewville. When we started to make our wooden sneakers and street artwork we would become known as Skewville.,Later, my brother and I split and now he runs a company named Skewville too, and the gallery we had at the Lower East Side was called Skewville too….,The whole initiative is actually to de-map the street and have the city make it a park. The street is barely used and I clean it up on daily basis. There is always just trash, condoms, hypodermic needles, broken bottles… Sometimes during the summer you see kids playing ball against the wall… So we took over that one wall that I know the owner and we cleaned up the block. Actually, for this Bushwick Open Studios it’s just a re-lauch, because we had a party there already. It is an ongoing thing… To promote this area and maybe possibly make it happen….,Yeah, and a broken window every month, guaranteed. I’ve been collecting that glass, and there’s a pile of it now…,Some of the artists that did this for the New Museum project: Leon Reid IV, Specter, Skewville and And Bast, a Brooklyn street art legend, is making a surprise visit… He’s making a giant piñata that is going to be hanging above the street. My brother is installing the actual grass down the entire street that says ,. And Veng RWK is painting the entire wall,It is a way for artists really to express themselves and to have a space devoted for that and obviously families and everyone can be involved. It is a community thing and that’s really what’s great about it! Although it may seem shady from me to try to have a place to paint right in my own backyard (, The truth is that it’s definitely better than what is there now and obviously it’s going to help to improve the community, so everyone is welcome!!  As long as they don’t throw trash! (,),Actually, a gallery is funding the material to make it:  all the eye balls from a doll park. Bast has to call them up when he’s done. If they buy it, he’s going to take it away, but if not everyone’s going to smash it! I am not sure what’s going to be inside of it yet….,

All the funds will go to support Bushwick City Farm  in a conversion of a vacant lot at Stockton Street that once used to be a spot for crackheads into an organic farm (we wrote about the project yesterday ,).

In the Hood," has taken over a new vacant lot at , and has been converting it into a little urban farming paradise. Go check it out and stop by at their , on Friday and Saturday from 6pm to 11pm at a brand new Bushwick gallery , (1501 Broadway)…,In the early 90s, growing up in Bushwick, a group of neighborhood kids, their parents and some local officials got together and decided to start up a community garden near the apartment on Garden Street (rather appropriate) where I was raised. Still, I remember getting my hands dirty while planting trees, learning about different types of soil and looking on in awe how we could grow fresh fruits and vegetables on our own–something this city kid had never even dreamed of doing before.,Today, however, they are taking me on a tour of their latest project, the conversion of a 9000 square foot lot on the corner of Stockton Street and Lewis Avenue. The long-neglected lot will become home to their newest farm site, over four times larger than their Broadway location.,As we walk from the Broadway farm to the Stockton site, Masha and Vinny know nearly everyone we pass on the street–local business owners, parents with their children, even the guys hanging out in front of the bodega, and all smile at the sight of these two neighborhood activists and all have something nice to say. This type of interaction illustrates just how much the pair loves and cares for the community and why they take on the countless hours of work needed to convert empty lots into vibrant farms and greenspaces that Bushwick sorely lacks.,It’s why they have food and clothing giveaways every Sunday (you can drop of any unneeded, gently used clothes along with any cooked or uncooked food at the farm on Saturday or Sunday), coordinate ESL classes and organize urban farming workshops. As they explain, while standing where herbs and vegetables will soon be planted, these sorts of projects build sustainable communities where everyone has a stake and a reason to participate. At the end of the day, this becomes more valuable to Bushwick than simply planting a garden.,Perhaps most impressive is that they undertake these projects with no government grants and no corporate sponsors or funding. Community members help out Bushwick City Farms in any way they can, whether it’s volunteering or giving a few dollars. That makes the tasks that much more difficult to complete, which is why they are organizing a fundraiser this weekend, May 27-28 from 6 to 11 pm at the 3rdEye(Sol)ation Gallery (1501 Broadway) featuring local art, refreshments and music. They have also set up a fundraising page at  IOBY, a site that supports local environmental projects (click ,).,So swing by their benefit or, at the very least, donate through the IOBY page so these two can continue the great work they’re doing!",,"Bushwick,Bushwick City Farm,Richard Alicea,urban farming","

Opinion,"With the conclusion of nearly two year run of a burlesque night I started at Piano’s of the lower east side, came retrospective and perspective.,My original plan was formulated during the first months of my move to Bushwick. I had a couple friends who I had met back in Boston, or traveling to fetish events in NYC and Florida who were involved with parties, art shows, events and performance spaces. I was excited to partner up, utilize as many spaces as possible and grow as a performer. What I did not know was that I seemed to have missed the boat of the burlesque revival by about 10 years or more, and indie performing arts by about 15. I saw the slew of opportunities to , merge all things into ONE. I saw it all in bright lights ,. But maybe more like a conceptual and dark burlesque performance during an art show to start with. One thing lead to another, and while I still have yet to curate a parade of apocalyptic proportions, I managed to produce two parties at three venues over the course of 3 years, with only shades of black lung and a few years off the end of my life to show for it. ,I had become so convinced I was moving forward, so enveloped in the consistency of these events , that I had forgotten to move forward. My greatest fear has been complacency, and here it was, staring right back at me on a weekly, or monthly basis.,Then suddenly, , I became overwhelmed by the dire urge to cut off an atrophied limb, as on a tree, to allow for new branches to sprout in it’s place and for the sun to reach the dead patch of dirt which had been previously obscured by shadows cast down by the thick branches. , I immediately sat down to compose an email to the venue managers ,, “regretfully” announcing my departure from the cliches of yesteryear; moving forward, always forward, to seek out and conquer new movements of dance.,▼▼▼▼▼▼▼,This week’s column was brought to you by:,sleep deprivation ,, The Frankie sandwich from Little Skips, 1 iced soy late, 1 iced black coffee, and an ass load of Haaagen-Dazs vanilla fro-yo ,▲▲▲▲▲▲▲",,"Curious Wednesday,ms. marquise","

While approaching the yellow Lone Wolf sign with the yoga mat under my arm, I realized that also Linda Thach from Little Skips was talking about the donation-based community yoga classes in the neighborhood.

I recognized the faces of at least of half of the people attending the class.

Kristin is a make up artists by day and was in yoga school at that time.  John, who is a photographer by day, traveled the world, and was part of sacred rituals in South America. They are both very proud of their space at 1089 Broadway, which is a large photo-studio by day and a place with a genuinely magical vibe.,Recently, Kristin started to teach yoga every Tuesdays, after years of yoga study and meditation practice.

Opinion,"If you ever wonder, how it is that you can make yourself stand out from the crowd, I can tell you that it’s by thinking big.,Leigh Bowery wouldn’t leave his apartment without at least a pair of stilettos on, that would clock him in at 7feet tall. Other times he would conceal those same heels in a pair of sneakers to maintain the height, and appearance of a giant fucking man. To top it off, he would also dress in latex, masks, latex masks, and British police hats which would rest on the top of his head. By now, you must be thinking, “I started to read this article because I thought ‘Size Queen’ referred to porn, or was going to help me get noticed,” well… yes, and no.,See, as great as Leigh was, I very much doubt he would have gotten any attention if he wasn’t a 300lb giant. Imagine a brightly dressed man with a mask on , standing 5 and a half feet tall, weighing 150lb. He would look more like a poorly made up clown than the world’s most influential club kid.,Ok, so if we make a list of what to do, and then cross out all the things that short people should not do because they will look like a clown, we get HATS.,There is a reason I have a full wall of hats , While it is true that you will get noticed with more ease with a 6″ boost to your gams, if you are not willing to commit to the daily pain of a strippers life , you might want to consider placing something outstanding atop your head. Uniform hats usually get as much attention as wide brim sun hats, worn at night. If that’s a little too ironic or goth, I suggest trying a Sunday church hat. My old male roommate , looked dashing with a small white box sunday church hat poised on the side of his head, and get this: he was not a gender bender.

They have become so good at it over the time that they are able to organize a festival, virtually, in a blink of an eye. Also they have been asked to host a bunch of music events at Union Hall.

Opinion,"Last week I wrote on the topic of self propelling motivation, being your own boss, and staying tough in the game of independent contractors. So I think today I’m going to bitch about some of the silly things encountered in such lucid environment. I say lucid because the longer you are running your own game, the more difficult it becomes to escape into a reality of comfortable delusions. Chances are, if you , manage to unclench the tight fist reality has grasping your throat, it wont be for long. Whether it’s by way of: dreaming, a tryst in an elevator, a wet dream about a tryst in an elevator, daily coffee highs, annual MDMA highs, thigh highs under construction boots or construction boots on the dance floor every Friday night at a salsa club in Harlem – it will end momentarily, spitting you out face planted onto the grimy floors of responsibility.,Fortunately, my escape comes in waves of simplicity; petting a cat, hand washing my back seam cuban heel stockings, checking the stats on my four websites, posting new listings on Yelp about my websites.,Unfortunately, from the same activities which allow such immersive escape emerges a frustration far beyond the reaches of meditation.,After  posting a listing on Yelp.com, concentrating ever so hard on flushing out my bio, the bio of the company, finding a way to lump everything I do under the usual title of False Aristocracy I hit UPDATE and it was done. I may as well have been skipping down the street glowing with the accomplishment of a most simple task. Not a week passed before I received a phone call from a high pitched voice by the name of Jessie Park. She seemed to be calling with concerns about my posting. I have had plenty of conversations with website and blog editors who I had not paid nor had planned to pay for collaboration, sponsorship, or information; I figured this was another one of those times. Within minutes we were deep into conversation punctuated by her perpetual and endless questions regarding my businesses, what I was aiming for, and how Yelp can help. Her high, flat tone made it impossible to differentiate between excitement, annoyance, positive reinforcement, or forcefulness. I begun to feel very coddled and confident in my descriptions, more so the third time she asked me to describe my positioning statement than the first. After the fourth round of the maternal inquisition, she apologized and said she had to run to a meeting or two, and that it was definitely, absolutely, necessary that we schedule the rest of the conversation for the following week.,When on that scheduled day she called half an hour late, I begun to take her a little less seriously, and when she emailed me to reschedule yet again, I became downright suspicious.,“What was she after anyway? Wouldn’t she have mentioned a particular advertising program with Yelp if she was trying to sell me her soul? Of course she would. Usually media kits come in neat little zip files with pdfs and charts, not annoying high pitched voices on a cold call,” I thought, replying to her email cordially. We had set a new phone date.,Having saved her phone number in my contacts, I was ready for her this third time; I answered in a matching shrillness of pitch. She jumped right into the questions again, now occasionally alluding to advertising. It must have been her lack of full knowledge on the topic which had started and perpetuated this confusion. Advertising is a noun which means: 1. the act or practice of calling public attention to one’s product, service, need, etc., especially by paid announcements in newspapers and magazines, over radio or television, on billboards, etc.: to get more customers by advertising. 2. paid announcements; advertisements. 3. the profession of planning, designing, and writing advertisements.,Having just watched , I was clearly seeing from the perspective of an ad agency, posting advertising in the form of a free listing on Yelp.com. The longer she circled like a vulture over our conversation, spiraling downward towards the carcass of my company, the longer I felt like pray. On her 10th circle around the same four questions I started demanding answers from her. After admitting to being in the sales, and seemingly calling from her home with noisy children screaming in the background, not only did she refuse to give me any solid statistics, demographics or projections, but also refused to quote in the present or send in the future any comprehensive form of media kit stating dollar amont exchanged for increased traffic. Her only excuse was that the numbers are always changing and that I had not told her mine, when in fact I had quoted multiple rates for a variety of projects. I became angry, raising my voice to a volume just under yelling, after which she shrieked, ,Oh, what familiar sentiments fragmented my reality just then, spinning me into a mental vortex of anger, resentment and bloodthirsty rage. I hung up the phone. “you should have asked,” I thought, “ignorant bitch.”,♡ Today’s column was written at Little Skips – office to some, second home to many. ♡",,"Curious Wednesday,ms. marquise","

People,"Bushwick is like a rough little alien animal that looks ugly on the first sight. Many people wrinkle their foreheads and noses in disagreement, when looking at it as if it smelled bad. But if you look closer, your heart has to melt, because this little alien animal has the friendliest soul.,One of the first things you will fall in love with in Bushwick, is the rich street art scene. The walls of the industrial buildings are beautiful and fantasy stimulating. Just walk around! Probably the most lovable of all the pieces around is , on Jefferson and Wycoff. “Bambi is sexy! Bambi painted over the paper birds is adorable”, says everyone. Bambi is the joint work of , and his friends, Broken Crow and Paint Goggles.,Soon enough after you fall in love with Bambi, you can start playing the message game with OverUnder. Look for the folded papers or paper bird tags of OverUnder not only in Bushwick, but also all over Brooklyn and read what he has to say. OverUnder is one of the most philosophical street artists out there:,And many, many more….,He has a strong voice and is not afraid to talk about the current affairs through his art on the walls. Shortly after the terrible natural disaster in Japan, OverUnder, with his friend No Touching Ground, made a large mural on Johnson Avenue called ,, where they urged the public to donate to Japan, even if it meant not being able to pay rent. Helping Hand struck the media strongly and proved that the power of street art is greater than just to making sad industrial buildings pretty.,OverUnder loves , surprising joint work with his peers. Lately, he made a whole bunch of murals with his buddies from Robots Will Kill, a collective that he recently became a part of.,There is certainly something serene about watching OverUnder spray paint on a wall somewhere deep in industrial Bushwick. OverUnder protests when I take photos of him riding around on a tall bike, because that’s too circusy according to him. I have to laugh. Many people stop by to take a snap shot of the newest addition to the Bushwick street art. OverUnder smiles friendly and exchanges a couple of words with a photographic bystander. His buddy , is sitting on a curb on the other side of the road, watching him doing the final touches on the wall. OverUnder’s girlfriend comes by just before the sun starts to set, and we’re all laughing when OverUnder misspells his own tag at the end of the day.,Read OverUnder’s blog ,.","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

Opinion,"As time shifts towards New York and away from my childhood in Boston, I look around and realize there is not one friend whose office I can use to send a fax. I collected myself and thought again; no, no one I know works in an office.,I cast a glance backwards four years to my last days at school. Half way through my senior year, I was really starting to feel righteous and excited. “Sure,” I thought, ” I might need to pull the wool over mom’s eyes for a few months when I graduate – plant myself in some cubicle – work on the plans for world domination, it’ll be as easy as twiddling thumbs.” While around me the seniors, many of whom were also taking “E^3″ the entrepreneurship minor, were casting their nets in all directions, aiming for contacts, internships and opportunities. Almost everyone I knew was either at a stable job or looking for a 401k.,It’s hard to believe how far I have distanced myself from the world of 9 to 5′s and how far it has distanced itself from me. The closest contact I have to office environments is my brother’s second wife submitting my botched resume to the legal department at her insurance company job, assuring me with email notifications that soon I will have a remedial, stable job and mom will stop worrying. On occasion my roommate will work in the art department on a feature film assisting the art director, production designer or less excitably, pushing papers. The latter can certainly be compared to a suit oriented job, as the production company usually takes over the abandoned offices of failed companies – some of which take everything, some of which leave the eerie scent of stale boredom lingering about the cubicles.,As my roommate and I occasionally live through each other’s experiences, I can claim that I am sometimes kicking the fax machine by the front desk in the lobby, and that sometimes my roommate has to check the calendar to find out where the hell I’ve been for the last four days, and where the hell he’s supposed to be. Lives that are lived close tend to drift to an fro, touching for a year or so, before drifting back to their original treaded paths. After working with him to raise a start-up BDSM & Fetish porn production company, then taking a year to assess our personal goals, we are both starting to waver in come very creative and solid directions. While I’m working on a new website to showcase the work of a young production company [without much porn, and without much of a scary crazy Russian investor] called hausNY, he’s helping produce trailers, shorts, reels and pilots for both new and old projects that come his way.,Hue Hefner [as well as many others] have been quoted to say “at the start I wore ever so many hats”. While it might take a while to get where we are headed changing hats all day – maybe longer but hopefully much sooner than getting tenure – it will certainly be nice to make senior partner, to myself.,——-,Today’s column was written while I indulged in ::,Haagen-Dazs , flavored frozen yogurt, with raw almonds and blackberries.,[The froyo can occasionally be found in Bushwick, at Bushwick & Myrtle's Best Deli, Myrtle & Broadway's beloved Mr. Kiwi or Khims Millenium Market on Bushwick & Johnson],——-",,"Curious Wednesday,ms. marquise","

People,"In my vintage 60’s dress obtained in Williamsburg a couple of days ago, with the utmost care, a love for clothing, and the determination to face any fancy society, I am standing at the entrance of a SoHo loft where , is throwing a benefit for her upcoming ,. I met Sarah a couple of weeks ago at , at 3rd Ward, where she came to present her living painting project.,She was like a fairy floating between the audience, giving away her famous matches (showcasing a scene from one of her Tableau Vivant performances, involving an implausible interaction between two young, nude females and two elderly, fully dressed women). I wasn’t quite sure what this Tableau thing was about, but I was determined to find out.,I do know that Sarah is fascinated by photographic portrayals of sharp contrast – This is highlighted in her work, both among her individual subjects, and between her subjects and their surroundings.,In the mean time, inside the SoHo loft, a pink cocktail is melting my insides, leaving me oblivious to the rain and mayhem outside. I am watching a portion of a documentary about the process creating the Tableaux Vivants and I am starting to understand how much care Sarah dedicates to the casting process of her models. In the performances, part of the cast performs nude, while others are fully clothed. An inseparable part of each of the Tableau Vivant performances is also a Bulgarian a Cappella group, enhancing the emotionally dense atmosphere on the stage.,Later on, in Sarah’s living room, I am drinking a peppermint chocolate tea she has prepared, admiring her collection of My Little Ponies and her attention to adorable details. I am thinking that her apartment doesn’t seem like the apartment of a famous artist, but, at the same time, I am wondering just how the apartment of a famous artist should look… Probably something like this.,Sarah is explaining the difference between nude and naked photographs. While nude photographers expose the human body as shape and object, Sarah is looking to position her models into a place where, through their naked bodies, they expose their deepest emotional states; their souls.,Sarah is describing how the idea of her Tableaux has evolved. In the very beginning, she just wanted a live photo-shoot, only soon to realize that she was actually creating a living painting. Sarah casts characters in a variety of ages, ethnicities, and personalities, with all sorts of backgrounds: from people working in the prudent environment of finance, who feel the desire to express themselves artistically, to professional artists. Most of the people coming to Sarah are determined from the beginning, whether they choose to perform naked or in clothes. Sarah says it’s 50:50. She directs them to interact with each other, and to express the strongest emotion they can feel – Some people choose tears, others laughter, some are sensual, others angry…The performances usually last about 30 minutes, though Sarah is aiming for about an hour in her upcoming 120 model Tableau.,All 7 of the past Tableaux have included a Bulgarian singing group. I am curious how an American photographer ends up singing tragic Bulgarian folklore songs – Sarah smiles, and tells me how by accident, she discovered a record of Bulgarian singing in The Providence Public Library while at art school, and thought it was the most beautiful thing she had ever heard. She has always been very musical and after she moved to New York, she decided to join a Bulgarian a Cappella choir, herself.,Sarah describes that her goals for Tableau Vivant, are not the photographs, or the documentary film. In the very fashion of the 19th century tableaux vivants, and in the spirit of old masters, it’s the performance and the experience itself, which is the ultimate goal…,

Opinion,"On a block in Chelsea devoid of nearly all advertising, at the west side edge of the world, hangs a lonely sign “Scores”, across from which is a series of large black doors and an ever growing line of sophisticated, middle aged spectators who had all signed up for the earliest time slot on this particular Tuesday evening.,A large, yet soft-spoken bouncer – in traditional security regalia of black sports jacket, black everything – is armed with one blue starred stamp and a short, bouncy sidekick on a walkie talkie – the ear piece strapped to his head.,They let us in 5-10 at a time, “good thing it’s warm out”, I thought as I took one last look down the line before I was ushered in with a handfull of strangers chatting behind me. Only a few steps beyond the door, total darkness set in, with one dim 5watt bulb hanging low in an old dusty fixture above our heads, it seemed as though it might as well have been shining darkness rather than light; I got tingle rolled down my spine. A few minutes later the line had become an exercise for my eyes, to acclimate to the deep black of the walls and the textures of indiscernible paint and concrete, plastic and metal.,Finally, arriving at the “concierge / check-in” of the hotel [venue] I was handed a playing card [10 of spades] and was told to walk to my right and make a left up the stairs.,HERE IS WHEN IT GETS CONFUSING.,By the time you reach the holding area, a smokey red velvet lined jazz lounge [sometimes] playing live music, you forget that you had just walked up X amount of flights, delivering you from the X floor to the X one. Here you listen for when your playing card is called by a crooner of a jazz lounge host, over a vintage microphone, you are ushered to the elevator by the lady of the dance floor. Then, you are handed a mask, ordered not to talk and crammed into an elevator where you will most certainly be separated from your friends. The elevator makes a random stop on either the X, X, X, or X floor, of which you have no say and no knowledge [if the liftman sees you looking at the number display he will shut it off, as I found out]. By the time you are ejected from this elevator, you realize that when everyone is wearing masks and are not allowed to speak [thus becoming anonymous] they become extremely rude, pushy and retain few physical limits when cutting you off. Granted, by now the later time slot / younger ticket holders had filtered in and mixed up the age demographic. We stampeded out of the elevator, I paused, body acclimating to the change in atmosphere.,By the damp chill in the air I could tell I was on the X floor, I walked around some bedroom chambers, a living room full of shelves, clocks and letters from Lady MacBeth. “A clue!” I thought, despite already knowing the premise. I walked in and out of tiny rooms, observing the meticulous decoration as much as I observed the other guests. When I had first imagined the scenes being interactive, my main concern had been people being too polite to ruffle through the drawers and notes. But the rapid news of such a liberally interactive installation must have spread fast, because everyone in eyesight was poking, prodding and sifting through relics like monkeys on a field trip. I circled my way through the layers of draped fabric and electric candles into a ballroom overwhelmed with the scent of pine. In the middle was a dance scene with three couples ballroom dancing in the broad sense of the term. In my corner of the floor, governess put a cloak on a young girl, then the couple hurriedly took off. I follow them; I loose track of the girl but follow the matron back up to the mezzanine of clocks, where she covers them, slowly, with cloths. I wander off to the balcony overlooking the ballroom scene I was standing on only moments ago, now on the dance floor a couple is fighting. A bald witchy woman is hissing at a man, they throw each other across the floor gracefully, landing like cats, or birds, or professional dancers. The man runs off to the side, up the stairs, across the floor – suddenly a crowd of 50 guests is hurdling themselves up the stairs trying to stay on someone’s heels. All heels are lost; I pick a doorway – and find myself on the X floor.,I see a new crowd in a corner in the room, heads bowed to peer down at something. Lady Macbeth is waiting impatiently, body contorting in spastic yet controlled, rhythmically precise movements, building with the crescendo of the song driving her madness. She balances on the edge of a bathtub before loosing her grip – her husband runs in, with blood covered hands, her back too is now stained red. She strips him nude while they embrace in a sequence of frantic kisses, intermittently pausing for his entry into the tub, his last strands of public discomfort shine in his eyes and stain his breath like pigments of hesitation. Rapidly, he rubs off the blood, then hesitantly with a staccato in his step he emerges from the tub to join his Lady; they walk back to the corner and lie down in bed. Then suddenly he sits up, jumps out of bed and leaves the room again; half the spectators follow, some stay – here the Lady rubs her hands repeating “out, out damn spot” as she throws herself violently against the walls and bed, repeatedly. I grow bored and wonder what other performances are going on as I stand glued to my spot, so I exit through the glass doors surrounding the bedroom chambers, and walk through a garden with half walls of brick and large statues of mary bathed in blue light, as I search for performances and a couple particular rooms I remember from the walk through, half of which I never do find. As I continue across the floor turns softer, and the scent of warm moist soil surrounds me. In the distance I see small mounds with white upward crosses stuck into the crests. At the end of the narrow path in the soil is an old abandoned stroller, one I would kill to have. I find my way to another staircase and climb upward.,On the X floor a scent of mulch fills my nostrils [maybe a little too much, as my tissues were coated in black upon exhausting the contents of my nose that night], enormous walls of crates and boxes unwind into a room with a pool table and a wall of 300 playing cards, many of queens, all tacked in one corner. Later, this would be the scene between two men and the bald witch, who will dance and laugh with a card between their lip-lock. The boy witch walks over, standing much too close, he urges me to move silently, seconds before the other man hurdles past and onto the wood bar with a loud thud. Two minutes later the girl on my left has her mask knocked by a stray foot in the tumultuous fray on the pool table. Another girl nearly trips over her own feet, which would have landed her face first on a wood box, trying to outrun the crowd to secure a front seat at the other end of the room to which the action has moved. The crowd is too much for me, and so I escape into rooms that are filled with black magic and dry purple flowers above my head, and others filled with musk like grandma’s. I look for an air freshener, a plug-in of sorts for at least 3minutes before I admit that if I were to find one, it would certainly not be labeled “grandma,” and that all objects, garments and fabrics in the room must contain centuries of history to smell so pungently of the past.,I wander back towards the room full of taxidermy birds, animal heads and bones as if it’s my one familiar sight in this strange massive world. The path there is a hallway of what seem to be a number of rooms and shops through wich actors move, there stands a girl with a box and a key, which a guest tries to touch and nearly gets her hand slapped. Another girl gets chosen and rushed off, pulled by her arm into a little room, to experience a solo show, a creepy lap dance of sorts with incantations and rituals I was not privy to this time around. I walk around the corner, a taxidermist’s workshop, nearby is a candy store; each room decorated and etched inch by inch to the last detail. A funeral parlor with a coffin, books, quill, ink wells and death certificates, stamped with the year 1934. And with that clue, things started to make sense. But, I have said too much already, I will leave not only the remaining X and X floors a mystery, but also the conclusion with it’s occasionally malfunctioning noose.,Folks, this is a must see. I don’t want to ruin ALL the fun and surprises so you will just have to trust me. I know here in Bushwick tickets upwards of $75 sound like less than a steal – but think of it as taking yourself on a date [yes, it's that good].

People,"Black coffee in a plastic cup that Andrew Birk served me in his studio at Johnson Avenue reached the perfect temperature to start being sipped and I just reached a peace agreement with my perfectionist self that this week’s Tuesday Person, Andrew Birk, will be photographed with an iPhone, instead of my regular bulky Canon 5D.,Andrew, a Bushwick painter, just lit up his cigarette and took a sip of his coffee as well. Noticeably hype on caffeine, he is jumping around, trying to show me everything at once: from a number of paintings to the music he likes and to his hand-made maisonette. Luckily, my coffee is starting to kick in nicely and I am able to follow Andrew’s speed.,Andrew, still holding his plastic cup, is just running up the stairs while explaining that virtually all of his paycheck from an art supply store goes to pay the rent for this studio. He doesn’t buy much food and runs on coffee instead. Andrew likes this deal.,We were both sitting on the chairs on the wooden maisonette, and Andrew is playing with the volume button of his stereo. “My friends and I make ,. This is my voice, I am talking about wanting to have sex with girls.” Andrew comments on the music that is playing in his studio. “Are you offended?” he asks and I have to laugh because I am actually impressed.,Andrew is excited that I am taking photos with an iPhone. He says that he hates those ‘beautiful’ overly fabricated photos in the magazines.  He loves noise and red eyes and is the biggest fan of amateur Facebook photos where everyone looks a bit dorky. “Yeah, it’s perfect. It actually works way better with what I am trying to make here. Like those paintings.” He points to a number of paintings lying on the floor. “I am trying to make as many as possible. Without thinking about what I’m doing. ” He says he’s trying to awaken the primitive inside of him, that monkey who, despite all the techniques he learned at art school, paints instinctively. Andrew is aware of the temporariness of these paintings and wants to make so many that they would cover the entire floor and people coming to his studio will have no other choice but to walk on them and destroy them.,I’m assigning my brain homework: Take ugly pictures! Forget crispiness, vibrant colors or aperture. This is iPhone 2 in action. Bring on the noise!,Andrew is telling me about this kid from California he likes, ,, and is asking me if I know him. I don’t and so he goes on: This kid makes a lot of music and uploads it to the Internet almost every day. Some of his stuff is pretty bad, but some things are great and Andrew generally likes this creative approach. Becoming a monkey, that’s a life-long mission.,

Arts and Culture,"Bushwick Daily is happy to introduce an iPhone photographer Prince Franco and a selection of 4 photographs from his ongoing series ,. Multiple layers of his Reflection photos unravel objects and feelings captured consciously and subconsciously as well. Prince takes these mainly on his train rides using his iPhone, which gives him a discrete profile as opposed to a DSLR camera. Prince says that he can’t afford a DSLR camera, nor he wants one and is fully determined to explore the limits of an iPhone.,Prince Franco was born in the largest housing projects in North America, in Queensbridge, Long Island City and at the age of 18 was arrested for an assault with a deadly weapon. That’s when he realized he doesn’t want to become just another minority guy in the NYC jail system and wants to create art. He studied fashion design and realized the power of capturing an image when his best friend introduced him to the famous polaroids taken by one of the most influential personalities of the time, ,.",,"photograohy,Prince Franco,Reflections","

Opinion,"My look into the world of interactive theater, and large scale installation art had exactly who starting points.,The first point was planted, like a stake of a tent, securely into the damp ground of my life a year and a half ago during the month of October. I had never worked on a “run” of any show, let alone a month long run of up to four shows a day, but many cast members had. My good friend , had asked me to participate as a character in an interactive, theatrical haunted house. The concept was fairly simple – , Ok, it was more simple than it sounds, at least after all the wrinkles were smoothed out by inevitable mishaps, poor planning or namely the sponsor’s lawyer who would walk around sending emails from his blackberry to the director with notes on censorship. The brunt of the creative blow weighed on the director and the cast, some of whom were let go and some of whom remained to piece together a very vanilla s&m halloween show. The one stable force was ,, the producer of many large events in both nightlife and theater, as well as Purgatorio. Despite being paid a day rate more suitable for a PA, it was hard to be late, knowing you would get a polite inquiry and stern look from the man who was becoming the show’s emotionally unavailable mother X your mildly flirtatious middle school teacher, who was entirely responsible for your check at the end of each week.,The opposite stake of my rather figurative tent was planted this past December of 2010. I had been walking around the Scope show warehouse of regurgitated art when one booth struck me. The wall noted the exhibit [or sculpture] to be titeled A Viking Funeral, by Ryan O’Conner. There was a pile of coal with two beautiful iron gates propped up in it with a metal rod projecting vertically in the middle, supporting a generously reflective chunk of broken glass. I stopped. My two escorts who at the time were wearing body suits of silver material more glaring than the glass shard, were also stopped at the edge of the booth, looking up a ladder at a man teetering at the top, tinkering with a track light. “How’s this?” he asked. Here I stepped forward, no longer being able to hold back my objection [an occurrence more frequent than the inverse], I voiced the opinion that the chair of hammers was much too aggressive to have any business hiding in the back. An hour or two [I obviously lost count after the placement of the 5 foot hourglass shaped structure] I was sipping on Johnnie Black, discussing my choices with Ryan, who was starting to reveal some local Bushwick affiliations and friends. By the end of our chat I had determined him to be a local artist forever on the run from mediocrity as well as a small town / community mindset, despite being inseparable from some ancient staples of Bushwick party culture, mainly the Danger crew [and now Artists Wanted].,I have had a lot of worlds and stories collide, no doubt to my surprise as much as  my readers’, but this was one was – as they say- for the books. I was told by Ryan, soon after our return from Basel | Miami | 2010 that I had to see the interior of this old club that had been remodeled into 6 floors of stages, with installations on every floor but the top most, and 22 actors playing out the story of Macbeth. As Vance stepped around the massive columns of the building to welcome our small group of wayward artists and visionaries, I let out a shriek of joy – , he was producing this show. As he wound us through the tour, spouting facts and figures without much thought, it became apparent how many tours he must be giving privately in order to keep this show away from main stream advertising and press. The rooms were filled with endless stacks paper, whole and shredded, taxidermy, claw foot bathtubs filled with dirt, dirt filled rooms with forests and forests of hanging dolls around cribs and eggs in cribs of filing cabinets filled with shredded paper files. IT WAS INSANE, which I am fairly certain was the production goal. With an estimated budget of $8 million, and $75-$85 / , I would hope t0 loose an ounce of sanity, for at least the two hours of my life during which I am lost in a play.,Yours Truly be attending , in the next couple of weeks – keep your eyes loosely open for reviews.",,"Curious Wednesday,ms. marquise","

Her blue eyes sparkle when she’s telling me about her upcoming travel plans to Iceland and India. She carefully uncovers her photographs with white gloves. She took those when traveled equipped only by analogue cameras. Allison says she prefers the discrete profile of her film cameras, in addition to the aesthetic and processes they lend. Actually, she always prefers the film cameras whether she’s somewhere far and remote, or as near as South Jersey.,Many weeks later after Allison develops the photos in her kitchen, she likes to look at them again. Then she discovers that some of them are more than just her travel memories.","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

Opinion,"Over the past few months I have written some fairly subjective stories about this show or that movie, even a story about a creep-tastic stalker accompanied by an amazing video. I was going to write this one a few weeks ago but first I had to write the , to , helpful little bit.,Flashback – after hearing the said creep boast for weeks about his multiple benefits cards [supposedly he had both his and his ex-girlfriends aka last identity theft victim] I realized that I, a white girl recently from the suburbs of Boston, with a college education was not only unemployed [according to the IRS] but also an exemplary candidate for the , in New York. Thanks to my cash only income and cash only rent payment, very little money flowed through my bank; I had virtually no profit. However, as benefits are determined per household [I guess they assume you and your roommates pool money for food?] I claimed virtually nothing over rent, stating that my roommate [you have to bring a lease, 2 forms of photo ID, pay-subs / letter from ""employer"" and a 12pg application] paid all of rent, and that I got paid $10/hr for 4hrs per week distributing flyers for a party. For this, I made up a receipt from my supposed boss [me], using a co-promoters name and signature below my promotional business card which I had stapled to the top of a receipt. I was so nervous about this forgery that I had actually forgotten to include my own name on the “pay stub”. For this, I had to return to the offices [in a building only slightly less confusing than the labyrinth of where you go to have parking violation hearings] a few days after my initial application, wait an hour to submit it as proof, and another 2hrs for a receipt stating that I had submitted proof of employment [which of course got lost, causing them to call me in for the first of a number of pointless hearings].,The catch is, when you say you don’t work, you have no excuse to rescheduling a hearing. Within a brief month or two of receiving my card [which I had to pick up in the city, rather than the one in brooklyn I had been walking to], my balance was no longer being replenished on the 6th of every month. I soon received a letter in the mail, stating that I had not submitted the required proof and employment [which I had the long awaited receipt for - useless] and was going to be called in for a hearing shortly. A week or two after the first letter, I received the second letter stating that I had a hearing in downtown brooklyn, at a 3rd location [a labyrinth worse than the first].,I had done a good job dressing in anonymous ready-to-wear and no make-up for the afternoon trips to the claims office, but the morning hearing was a different story. Luckily I remembered to not put on make up or heels, but did mistakenly wear a particularly prominent set of knee high puma boots. Hiding them uncomfortably under the pine table of the inquisition booth, the judge took one look at my paperwork, and after a few preliminary questions to verify my identity, she promptly dismissed the case. My obligatory $4.50 metro card was issued to me at the end of another line and I was on my way home. I was giddy to know the three months of back pay were going to come through just in time for thanksgiving [which would have meant I was starving for months now, had I actually only $40/week to live on]. I spent it all in one foul swoop of mash and pies, as well as some bottles of wine my local organics food mart allowed me to buy with food stamps [totally illegal].,I received my next letter 6months in to my  benefits program, only 2 months after the first hearing; it was a form to send back, confirming the unfortunate state of my unemployment, and to let me know in these cold months about , [which I promptly applied to and received benefits of something like $450 over the course of the winter - a droplet in the pool of $4k we paid for occasional winter warmth].,In the spring, I received another summons, this time they didn’t believe that I was residing in Brooklyn due to my Massachusetts mailing address and license. Rather, I received a temporary cease of benefits notice, which was then followed by a summons to the tall downtown Brooklyn maze of a building. There I was scolded gently by my case defendant / spanish translator for not having a NY license, after which the case was once again promptly dismissed. It was clear to me on this day that I had to make a decision: MA health insurance – or – NY food stamps.,A couple months later, in the summer, a year since I had printed out the outdated, 2008 revision of an , from the state website [which I filled out, brought to the office, only to find out it was last years form and that I had to fill it out again], I received the annual resubmission letter, which I ceremoniously placed in the left side pocket of my benefits folder [which had grown to the size of the folded Sunday Times], and closed it like another chapter in my curious life.",,"Curious Wednesday,ms. marquise","

People,"It is any Friday night in Bushwick. The setting is simple. There are paintings hanging on the walls and about 3 times as many people as you could possibly imagine fitting into this gallery. The beer is still warm, and the gin tonic in my hand has been clearly been prepared by someone who strongly discriminated against tonic in the said mixture.,“So… you’re a sculptor?” I’m standing underneath an abstract piece with a girl named ,.,“Yes.” she smiles.,“But… you’re really into… music?”,“Not that much into music. I’m more like into … sound.” says Audra with a smile of a person who has a really nice secret that she might be willing to share if I prove to be patient enough to listen.,Audra is the author of an experimental sound piece in the upcoming and very first Bushwick ballet presented by ,, called ,. The ballet premiers on April 14 and I am determined to find out what does sculpture and sound have in common before that.,I’m two steps behind Audra who is a Bushwick resident, but her studio is in the very industrial part of Williamsburg, about 2 blocks away from the water. The sun has just begun to set and the pipes, tubes, and huge containers filled with undefined liquid are throwing long shadows. The workers have already left for their homes. It is strangely quiet and the industrial beauty mesmerizes me.,“It’s a little sketchy here.” Audra laughs.,Audra’s studio is filled with books about sound, phonetics, speech, and with maps of sounds. She talks about the sculpture on the floor, which looks like many houses stuck together in a very claustrophobic manner. It is part of the series of sound formation in concrete, she says. Normally, these wedges are made of foam and are used in anechoic chambers.,Still curious about the sound piece for the ballet, I ask Audra to play me the piece she has created for A/V Elevator Project at Art in General, which inspired , of Norte Maar to invite her to participate at the creation of the ballet. Audra says she has created a series of layered sounds that explore communication through fragmentation. She recorded sounds of her own voice and edited out the main parts of each word to leave a series of stops and starts; a slippery language of faintly recognizable utterances. Audra explains that this way, attention is drawn to the cadence of voice without language. She calls it ,.,Audra was inspired by the work of Julles Valles, ,

Opinion,"The last time I tried to attend the NYC Opera, it was one of those summer runs where the admission is free.,It was one of those days that’s too hot at first but becomes uncomfortably chill as the sun sets behind the surprisingly tall buildings around 66th and broadway. We anticipated the crowds and thus arrived an hour early only to find not a single seat without a placeholder sweater or bag, beside a row of family members scowling at one another or an elderly couple scowling at you. To my surprise, the free opera my friend had been raving about for weeks was just a large projection of a prerecorded show, cast on a large white screen outside the main entrance of the opera house, for over 300 senior citizens of new york to gawk at in reminiscent of when their social security could accommodate a budget of live entertainment, and if this is indeed what the 21st century entailed.,We took a vote; it was in the favor of taking our picnic to central park, rather than the stairs of the opera house courtyard which too by the hour encroaching the screening was becoming unbearably crowded with early latecomers. The group of us sat in the park, each having a private monologue about the successes and failures of the trip; concealing my discomfort on the cold rocks and disappointment with my misconceptions of what a free opera would entail with occasional laughter, I silently wondered what my first opera in NYC would be.,A little over half a year later, a very gracious friend who I greatly appreciate the company of extended an invitation to the opening night of “Monodramas” [which runs March 25th - April 8th] via the hospitality of John Zorn and friends.,I pick up the program and read the three synopses for the pieces I am about to absorb. I have just enough time to finish them before the lights begin to dim; I close the program, reminding myself to look over the notes and artists later.,The first piece was by our friend ,, which up until reading the program, I had assumed composed all the music for the evening. This first opera was roughly 20min long and called “La Machine de L’etre” [""The Machine of Being""] and focused on the direction of chaos via musical composition and projected drawings by , in his less gracefully years from the end of his celebrated and schizophrenic life as a beautiful person. The most exciting parts where:,1. the drawings [projected into two word bubbles suspended above the actors, one of which combusted into flames as a finale - which I thought was a copout] by Artaud, because I have a childhood fascination with schizophrenia,2. The man in a red zoot suit who was suspended towards the finale [because if was the only color in the costumes and because it woke me up a little],3. The fact that Zorn did not write any text for the piece, nor gave stage direction. He left all the visual aspects up to the interpretation of the stage director. What a guy. LET THIS BE A LESSON TO YOU.,The second piece was an old one by , with text/libretto written in an actual language [German] by 26 year old psychology student , in the early 1900′s translated on a wide screen at the top of the stage. It was called “Erwartung” [program translation: ""Waiting"" // wiki translation: ""Expectation""] and was the most coherent plot line of the three. It went on for about 30min displaying objective and subjective, loving and suspicious thoughts of a woman who, in a dream, is to meet her lover in the woods but discovers him dead. The drama builds, as the rose petals perpetually fall from the rafters, accumulating on the floor. The conclusion shows how she suspects herself to be the killer, or rather perpetrator of the relationship as she first approaches him still alive in the forest; an abstract flash forward within a lover’s mind.,The third piece “Neither” seemed longest, but was no longer than the second. It was intermediate in age compared to the other two pieces, being composed in 1976-77 by , to a libretto by ,. It was the most abstract but summed up concretely the subject of simultaneous objectivity and subjectivity within one persons internal dialog. The music was a repetitive nine note loop, with mildly coherent pronunciation [mostly the last line ""unspeakable home"" which resonated for hours after leaving the venue]. The tones changed whereas the notes stayed the same, to the effect of someone singing to you for 30minutes on a rather fast carousel ride. The lulling composition and brilliant soprano put me in a trance for some portions of the piece, but not enough to overlook the tacky reflective stage backgrounds [no doubt in an attempt to elongate the stage] or the musical theater kids they hired to play patty cake with themselves several times towards the height of the internal turmoil. However, the three tiers of suspended silver cubes lifting and falling made up for it all.,If you like tension, this is one’s for you.",,"Curious Wednesday,ms. marquise","

I was surprised. Questions like, “What demographic of press do they cater to? What other films do they represent?” arose as I compiled my slight pile of research findings. As the weeks after my group interview progressed, I began receiving emails from the same publicist inviting me to attend other screenings; apparently publicists function a lot like nightlife promoters – you’re having dinner with them one evening, you’re on a million and one mailing lists [they've sold your name to], the next. I took it with a grain of salt, and read the synopsis for the film in question.,, was being screened more than a handful of times, I chose one – midday and midweek – to avoid the younger writers I had to sit with during that aforementioned round table talk with Quentin Dupieux, some of whom could not name exactly which publication they were writing for that day, when interrogated in the elevator.,“This will be chill,” I thought as I emailed an invitation for Mr. Haley to join me, “like a research date.” Little did I know I would need a bodyguard.,We get to the Sony building on Madison and 55th; we wind our way through a series of doors and hallways, elevators to floors where they check IDs and names, followed by more elevators to other floors where they take those tickets and tell you to sit, and wait. I look around from my vaguely appointed seat; 10 scattered, middle aged, weathered individuals, with a staidly pall cast over their demeanor sit stooped and silent in their seats.,I excused myself to the ladies room; upon my return, with some speed, a healthy gait, and flourish to my long military trench, I curved around a section of chairs where a lady of indiscernible age was wedged into her large leather seat. I came to a seat directly across from her, longwise across the coffee table, circumvented by 8 square, black leather chairs. I perched on the armrest, staring down at the printed synopsis and listing of cast and awards, alternately glancing at the cactus air plants in the square glass vases – wondering about my failure to keep my own alive and how much the interior designer was paid to come up with such a depressingly modern theme of grays.,“EXCUSE ME. I’m sorry. Can I just ask you a question.”,A woman’s loud voice pierced the air, interrupting my thoughts, offending my ears, and generally starting me from a very meditative state. Her appearance was no less shocking. Beneath her large flat brim, hunter green, forest hat, complete with shoelace chin strap, was a short, plump lady with several large bags next to her seat [and may has well had just as many mangy cats heaped on her knees]. She shoved her body weight forward in the seat with effort, straining her short arms to keep her leaning forward without tipping out. [Mr. Haley later remarked, ""she looked like the white homeless women from the myrtle + ryerson intersection circa 2000, with a slightly more trim mustache.""],“I JUST want to ask – is it painful to walk in those shoes?” Oh my, could this be a compliment escaping from those weathered lips?,“No, they’re actually quite comfortable despite their appearance. They’re platforms – so they’re not so bad.” I lift my foot up an inch to the side to show her what I mean.,Like a dog given the biggest biscuit it’s ever seen, she jumps up in her seat, growing another inch – she exclaims:,“HA! NOT SO BAD. So they DO hurt. YOU’RE A SLAVE TO FASHION!!”,The possible come backs fly through my head, too fast for my tongue to grip onto a single sentiment:,“I’d rather be a slave to fashion than a slave to mediocrity.”,“How does it feel to push everyone way?”,“Do you enjoy being lonely?”,I stare for half a second before shaking my head to loosen my grip on her proverbial neck. I immediately go back to my conversation as if not a beat had been skipped, just like drunk dancing a tango.,An announcement is made, I hear her gather her pile of bags [and imaginary cats] to enter the theater, we wait a while then follow; the lights dim and opening credits roll. Still shaken by our encounter with crazy pre-war feminist lady Mr. Haley and I take our our phones to silence them - there are no ushers here, no previews to warn us about the dangers of distractions.,Another voice pierces the silence, a different tone comes from close behind. “Can you PLEASE turn your phone off, I find it VERY DISTRACTING”. She sits back down before I could snap right back. More head shakes and private threats ensue.,Despite the film preaching passive agression, I was charged with anger by the end of the two hours, hoping for a second run in. Better luck next time – maybe one day I’ll decide to be a diva and make a scene; for now, I write.,_____,I wanted to share the look with my readers [but as some of you know, I have problems keeping clothes on so here is a photo, sans Ms. Marquise].

People,"Ari has been rummaging through the insides of his old-fashioned blue Garelli moped for quite a while now, only to pull out something which, if his moped was a human would probably be a gut. ,. “Here’s the carburetor,” Ari says, smiling. I’m making my very fake ,face at him, and nod. I’m wandering around, checking out a number of mopeds in the store and then in the workshop in the back. Both Ari and his buddy Pete are super-concentrated on the mopeds’ insides, so they barely pay attention to me or my curious camera. I like some of the mopeds a lot, particuarly their vintage looks and funky colors. Most have a sticker on their front light. “That’s a cute deer,” I giggle, and Ari explains in a serious voice, that’s no deer, but a Jackalope. And it is a pretty serious matter, because the Jackalope is their moped-gang sign.,Ari Sneider and his partner, Pete D’Addeo, opened a moped store called , barely two weeks ago at 1022 Broadway in Bushwick.,After Ari is finished pulling out what appear the random insides of his blue moped, he announces he’s ready for a ride. He parks his moped in front of the store and then pulls out a gray brand-new Tomos. For me, he says. My facial muscles fail miserably to create my well , face. And with mild hesitation, I announce I’ve never ridden a moped before. “It’s easy,” Ari says, and he starts showing me how to start the engine and how to brake; he commands me to make a small loop in front of the store. The little gray devil accelerates surprisingly quickly, but soon the moped and I find common grounds for discussion, and , I feel like a little kid at an amusement park.,I spent the next hour following Ari’s shirt, reading his signals–should I go right, left, slower or faster. We’re all over Bushwick and Bed-Stuy and finally I understand what is meant by the saying, “One try is worth 1,000 hours of watching.”  It’s incredible fun and freedom! The streets look completely different from a moped perspective, and I feel like I’m on a vacation somewhere in the Mediterranean.,Ari got into mopeds in high school, but getting a new one was never an option, so he built his moped from parts and just never stopped working on it. Ari says riding in a bigger group is the best, and his , makes long, enjoyable rides frequently. I’m starting to understand where the joy of a ride comes from, and with a large grin, I wave my gray devil goodbye.,For now.","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

In the Hood,"“I’m going to a farm,” I announced on a sweet afternoon in my humble Bushwick dwelling. I have to say that my roommate, as well as myself were surprised by the sound of these words, because let’s face it, you can say many things about Bushwick (like that it’s lovable, enjoyable, inspiring), but certainly it’s not the greenest place on Earth. If I try really hard I can name 5 locations with trees in my close neighborhood (maybe)…  And now I know a place right here on 897 Broadway between Arion and Belvedere with a greenhouse, compost, heard of chicken, 1 duck and a bunch of shy kittens. Yes, it’s ,.,I am meeting Masha and her boyfriend Vinnie who have gotten things moving. With the help of community they have turned a vacant lot between two houses into a city farm. They cleaned the lot, built shelters for animals and for virtually 800 single dollar bills they had collected from donations, they bought a stack of fresh soil.  Masha says that the soil in the entire Tri-Sate Area is toxic, so they elevated a part of the lot, covered it with fresh soil, built a greenhouse and planted vegetables there.,The chickens are slowly loosing their fear of me and they are curiously checking out my camera. I’m paying my respect to the huge rooster who is proudly bossing around. Masha explains that most of the chickens are rescues from Pollo Viviero, a nearby slaughterhouse where they keep them in terrible conditions. People sometimes bring them new chickens, or they just find them on the street in front of the farm. New additions to the poultry team first have to spend couple of day in an isolated shelter for quarantine.,Masha and Vinnie also collect books and clothes. They made friends among organic grocery stores and bakeries who give them food for free. On the need basis they give it away with all the vegetables, fruit and eggs from the farm to the local people. They teach English and organize workshops where they teach urban people about farming. They have seen school kids discovering on the farm that chickens and eggs have something in common… Masha smiles that they bring generations together. Grandparents explain to the kids how they used to have chicken in the old country.,The volunteers are always welcomed at the farm and you can help, donate and enjoy at the same time this weekend already. From Friday through Sunday at 1-7pm you can come to hang out at the farm, observe social relations in the heard of poultry, play with kittens, drink hot cocoa, taste organic food and enjoy books with Masha and Vinnie.,

,We haven’t heard from , since ,, but that doesn’t mean that great literary and arts fun has disappeared from Bushwick. Fireside Follies returns this Saturday, March 19, at 7 pm, to their regular home base, ,, presenting cartoonist collective ,.,
Bushwick Daily was curious what inspired Fireside Follies to switch from curating a reading series to throwing a comics and music party. We chatted with Mike Lala, a poet and a co-curator of the event.,
Mike explained that Julia Wertz (,) was one of the readers at January’s Fireside Follies and her comics full of edgy humor and self-irony, received such a huge response, that they decided to team up with a collective, Pizza Island, and organize an event around comics. The all-female cartoonist collective is based in Greenpoint, and the girls will be reading and projecting their comics.,
The event will also feature music from the production of David Heatley and Jeffrey Lewis.,
In the good Fireside Follies spirit, admission is free, but donations are welcomed.,
When talking with Mike, he leaked some  information that Pizza Island is not an abandoned island in the sea of Bushwick…  Soon we will have a brand new series to look forward to, called ,.

Opinion,"I seldom relive the few days of my life when I was in ultimate fear, which for an equally short while kept me ultimately amused. It started in a bodega, late night, on the corner of myrtle and broadway, just before half the bodegs in the area had closed, and another half had opened. I was coming home from an event, probably that weekly party I was throwing at Happy Ending, with a friend who didn’t seem to be getting the hint. He lived close by and so I took the buddy system opportunity to have an escort for the not so dangerous subway ride, and less dangerous block walk home. Little did we know that along that path we would meet a man who was not only insane, but insanely resourceful, a most dangerous combination.,I thought he looked familiar, reminding me of some friends in the industrial scene from years past, back in Boston, MA. I knew that some of them had moved to the area, and so I felt certain that we had met before. Doubt clouded my intuition as my friend and I approached the front of the line, and thus him, who was waiting for a sandwich to be complied behind the deli counter. As we watch he pulls a can out of a paper bag, and slams it down on the counter with a grin and says “here, add this”. It looks like dog food, that stuff they put in Sloppy Joes at public schools and summer camps, ground beef in some sort of sauce. He looks at us and says, “they do not sell it here, so I had to buy it next door and bring it over”. The flood gates were open. He kept rambling on, speaking at us rather that to or with, his nonsense had some sort of hypnotic effect. It was the last time I took, “you live in that house?! I’ve been wondering for years what it’s like inside!” as initiative to let anyone in. I looked at my friend, with a look that said, without mistake, do NOT leave. We all went upstairs. The stranger with his huge dog [ which later I found out he borrowed from his little brother to look more human and approchable ], my friend and I. We sat around listening to stories as the stranger crushed up lines of adderall pills on my tiny glass coffee table. It soon became bright out, but uppers effect me too greatly to just sit tight, or just clean the entire house. The three of us, and the dog left for his place to watch one insightful movie or the other for another 8hrs, into the day. Unfortunately, my friend was not as affected by the adderall, and decided to walk home soon after our group exit. I sat awkwardly on the strangers couch, mind reeling, concentrating much to hard on the movie. He offered me downers, explaining they were opiates and would allow me to sleep. I look them. I spent the next 48hrs vomiting. About a month later I found out they were some sort of generic methadone, meant to keep his younger brother off heroine.,In the following month, I would get calls and text ranging from 2 to 10 times a day about how he was walking by my house, and whether I needed anything. He would show up at places I didn’t exactly invite him to, saying he was in the area anyway. Nothing was exact, but nothing was accurate. I couldn’t call him out on anything, not even when his mother, conveniently wandering the city, meeting up with him, who was also conveniently in the city, when I was done with a walk-through I might have mentioned the week before. She seemed as confused as I was, he blamed it on her delirium, saying, “mom, you remember where I work! You’ve been there before.” The architects directory did not list him, nor his mail. The background check did. My roommate and I marveled at the 10 or so misdemeanor accounts listed in Floria, I contacted the one friend he had ever mentioned by name. He was also from Floria, but was now in Fort Greene. I inquired professionally, asking for a creative reference, of the musical persuasion, since our stranger had claimed to be in quite a few non-local bands. Negatory. I read the response between the lines, “stay away.”,As my next few responses to text messages became stern in unavailability and nondescript in location, his became angry, confused and threatening. He demanded to know why I was not telling him where I was, if not home. I became scared, looking both ways before opening and closing the doors behind me. I would see him walking around the block at all hours of the day and night. The phone calls from his number, blocked numbers, and even fake ones did not stop for days. Soon, pleading emails came in. In his head, we had become romantically involved, he had planned on proposing to me. My friends and I were aghast. For a second I thought, “maybe he took our complete lack of physical and emotional involvement during the one month were in contact to mean I was old fashioned?” but a second later I realized that would be insane. I felt sad for him, in between the rushes of fear. He was calling everyone in the room, whose number he had acquired with one lie or another. He was calling from downstairs.,After my roommate chased him out of our building, the stranger went on, stalking bodegas for someone who was less inquisitive and much, much more impressionable. Thanks to the one friend who forgot to block him on facebook, we know that a few months later he got married [the legality is uncertain] to a girl more than 10 years his junior. Their child is now over 1yr old.,On a lighter note, check out my favorite recent creep lifestyle video with man after my own heart, John Waters ::",,"column,Curious Wednesday,ms. marquise,Wednesday","

People,"The walk through industrial Bushwick seems neverending until I finally reach 513 Johnson Avenue, to meet Ryan Ford…and himself. That’s a joke I’ve been making in my head ever since I saw one of Ryan’s paintings, called ,Ryan is portrayed in blue boxer shorts in a ready-to-fight posture next to a huge flesh monster with several mouths, releasing what I believe are evil demons.,Ryan is a funny, laid back guy with a healthy sense of self-irony and a passion for good food. He’s leading me to his studio, we’re stepping onto iron stairs in an old factory building as he’s explaining how he saw this huge bald guy in a restaurant who had thick rolls of skin on his neck; Ryan decided to make a painting of a skinny vegan neck and a thick, fat “BBQ neck,” in a park. The painting isn’t finished yet, but it’s pretty hilarious already.,I can’t stop looking at the peculiar artifacts in Ryan’s studio as he, dismissing my objections, is serving delicious crackers, big fat black olives, ricotta cheese and a home-made iced tea, served in a jar filled with ice cubes.,I point my finger, as a request for an explanation, at a large pink mask with a number of tiny toy figures attached. Ryan inhales deeply, makes his typical grin and says, just like it was the most ordinary thing in the world, that it’s his shaman mask. Naturally.,I’m getting slightly distracted by the sweet pineapple cubes Ryan has served on a small painted table, while he’s explaining how he heard his calling–and, oh, did he hear it loud–during an art history class in college, when the teacher mentioned Native American shamans and their rituals. “That’s what I wanna do with my life!” young Ford exclaimed to himself. “I wanna be a shaman!” And he began  to research the topic thoroughly, as every young aspiring shaman should. Later Ryan came to a point where dusty books ceased to be enough, and he longed to practice his newly developed shaman skills.,So, every once in a while Ryan opens his studio to his friends, especially to the friends with infected brains, and he performs in a shaman costume and a mask he created for these festive occasions.,Ryan says that in addition to the rituals he read in books, he does what he feels intuitively.,And so this Saturday at his studio at 513 Johnson, #1 at 8pm, the fires will be flaming, infected brains will be purified, possessed bodies will fly in the air, and Ryan will laugh.

Opinion,"I always wonder: who lives for those weeks of heavenly hell, when you are lucky to get 2hrs of sleep between having panic attacks and inducing them. On occasion I also wonder: who lives for the lulling weeks in between.,In the last 3 years, since moving to New York, I have found [as expected] a considerable increase in anxiety as a direct result of taking on too many projects. The truth is, the early stages of project hoarding, I begin to experience this sense of an elevated calm. It’s very difficult to explain this sensation in out of body terms other than using clichés such as “the calm before the storm,” but it is very similar to the floating sensation during the first minute of sky diving, [minus the deafening wind and ear pressure]. Maybe even closer in semblance to that last intake of air before you step over the edge of a cliff to plummet into a cold watery ravine [which I find by far more frightening than sky diving].,At times my mother has described me as a thrill seeker, dangerous unto myself; at times she’s even ventured as far as to call me a masochist. And while the latter can be held as truth on both physical and emotional levels, I have certainly not grown out of getting my kicks.,By now, you must be asking yourself, what exactly does this have to do with Armory Arts Week. This sensation, which I have now taken 235 words to describe is exactly how it felt to get involved in what is essentially a week long art faire, which like the fashion week, takes over every street in participating neighborhoods all over the city and brooklyn. It’s not exactly the Art Basel of Switzerland or even Miami [that would take too much silicone and stretch fabric], but it’s just as chaotic, much closer to home so to speak. Everyone is adding their twist on the fair, resulting in satellite fairs, private receptions, parties and carefully choreographed dinners, feet getting stepped on, and stepping on feet. Despite the its small size, I don’t think this city will ever get too crowded regardless the amount of talent it obviously holds, but at times it sure does have the persuasion of a pageant being held in you own back yard, or in this case, paved back lot. I mean that in the most endearing sense, that no matter how many dinners I walked into and how few people I knew, it felt like home every time. Whereas coordinating the events I was part of felt like the even hum of a tornado whirring within arms reach, the feeling of stepping through its spilling walls and flying debris left me exhilarated once inside, standing in the safe center of its conical walls, in mild anticipation of stepping out again and being left drained on the other side.,I used to think life was lived much like Dorothy had, waiting for the next tornado, or like Alice, poking around for rabbit holes. But in the last three year my perspective has changed; now digging furiously in gardens, and chasing tornados in a van.",,"armory arts week,Curious Wednesday,ms. marquise","

Performance artists, dancers and musicians will offer a condensed, two-day sampling of work at five hub spaces and a number of satellite venues. Make sure to pick up your map today, they are all over Bushwick, because , offers so much stuff that you can easily get lost! We invited the festival’s organizer, ,, to talk about SITE Fest.,You name it. If it falls under the performance umbrella, we’ve got at least a little bit of it. Performance art, durational and short form nature. Dance. Theater.  A lot of comedy. A lot of bands are playing. People are going to be doing public street interactions.  We even have writers interacting with artists, making live pieces in front of us in one of the satellite spaces…,On both Open Studios and Beta Spaces, we noticed that there were a lot of performing artists that were part of it. It wasn’t just visual artists. I am a performing artist myself, and I wanted to create a festival where I could showcase them. Often it’s a crucial thing for performers that they don’t have access to space to perform in, so I thought that Arts in Bushwick could use our existing relationships to offer space to performers for one weekend.,There are definitely a lot of performers. And it keeps growing every year… Site Fest includes both artists who live in Bushwick and artists who don’t live in Bushwick, but they are all happy to make work here for the weekend. I know there is a large dance and theater community based in Bushwick and over the years I’ve seen the number of performances and music shows increase.,Thanks to Open Studios and thanks to our long-term existence and good reputation in the neighborhood, and because of my own work as a performer at The Bushwick Starr, 3rd Ward, Chez Bushwick and Grace Exhibition Space, these wonderful organizations donated their spaces for the weekend, as they have done for the past two years. And I have traded performances,so there is going to be something going on at all hub spaces at all times!,There are five hubs: 3rd Ward, Chez Bushwick, The Bushwick Starr, Grace Exhibition Space and Goodbye Blue Monday and 26 satellite spaces, which are produced by people who wanted to curate and produce their own shows.,Gosh, that’s so hard. There is so much amazing stuff. I am definitely excited to hear , play at our launch party on Friday night. They are friends of mine but also I love their music and it’s great that they are going to be playing at the party, because they incorporate a lot of performance aspects into their band presentation. I am excited for , presentation, which is taking place at their house. And I am excited to see the relationship between the duration-based work at Grace Exhibition Space and sort of more momentary performances that are also going to be happening there. Some stuff is going to be 7 hours long and some stuff is going to be 10 minutes long. And we have three people who are doing street performances and one of them is actually coming all the way from Belgium to do it.

People,"They say you shouldn’t read tarot for yourself. It gets confusing and your own hopes and desires get in the way. Some even say you can go mad if you do it. ,–descendant of gypsies, psychic, artist, writer and drug-prevention activist–never reads for herself, either. It gets all blurry, she says. So I did it.,from an introduction to Katelan in her memoir, ,.,Kat has never fit into traditional social structures. In her early years she undertook a spiritual road trip accompanied by her cousin and best friend, Holly. She did a lot of thinking about life, society, her place in the world, and the things that are worth standing up for… Drugs would often be the key to the thirteenth chamber, a train ticket to take her and Holly places.,“,Chills run down my spine as I read parts of Kat’s memoir about the death of her first love, Brian, and then Holly. Each died of a heroin overdose.,Kat and I are sitting on the floor in her room. Her giant cat is soundlessly walking around, gazing at me every once in a while, as if she was trying to make sure her lady is being treated with all due respect she deserves. Kat is telling me how she had been looking for her and Holly’s diaries for years. And then, one day they appeared… In a room where nobody has looked in a long time. She pulls them out, one after another, from a drawer. My fingertips touch Holly’s handwriting. The air is filled with emotions, though neither of us admits as much with our body language. Pink old-fashioned wallpaper. Several decks of tarot cards. Nine glasses filled with water to honor the memory of the loved ones who have passed away. Katelan’s self-portait hangs on the wall.

In the Hood," has toured over 40 cities in the world and this Saturday it is coming to , in Bushwick! The idea of Slideluck is simple. People come, have chili, beer, talk and watch slideshows showing art by local artists. Could there be a better way to combine art than with food and a party? Bushwick Daily chatted with Slideluck’s producer, who is also a Bushwick resident, Carly Planker.,Slideluck Potshow as a global initiative, as an art program it is about being inclusive, about creating a nurturing artistic environment. We are trying to bring people together instead of excluding people. A lot of art openings in New York feel cold. As you walk into a Slideluck event, it feels so friendly. It is about community experience.,It all started in the Seattle backyard of my boss, Casey Kelbaugh. Soon it started to grow, and now people just email us from all over the world to say that they want to have a show in their city. Last year was the busiest year we’ve ever had. We did the whole European tour; this year we’re launching Asia, Australia and New Zealand.,Yes. It’s simple. People like food, people like art, people like to hang out.,The last 4 events we’ve done in New York were called Slidelucks, as opposed to Slideluck Potshows. There is no potluck dinner where people bring in food. Slidelucks are smaller events. Slideluck Potshow would have 40 artists; and for an event like Slideluck Bushwick, there will only be 20-25 artists. The food will be provided by a chili cook-off, we have 5 teams competing. There will be one vegan and one vegetarian chili.,The Bushwick event is the beginning of our Brooklyn series. We will be doing other smaller events in other neighborhoods. Although, Slideluck Bushwick might end up being kind of big, because of the 3rd Ward space, which allows it; we’re expecting about 200 people.,Definitely, the whole Brooklyn series will be about younger artists. We try to sprinkle in few people who are already well established. On Slideluck Bushwick, we will have Rene Clement, Sarah Small and Nat Ward.,We were trying to keep the whole show under an hour, and we are trying to have a variety of slideshows. There is a digital projector that will project on a white wall. We have all sorts of visual artists showing their work. Also we have two artists from 3rd Ward designing victory prizes for the chili competition: Buck Jackson made a lathe bowl and Michelle Beaulieu made a big victory pin.","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

In the Hood,"Art accessibility think tank , just opened its Active Space at 566 Johnson Avenue in Bushwick. The  plans Ashley Zelinskie and Jeffrey Peña have sound really great.  Bushwick Daily chatted with Ashley about the mission of Curbs &  Stoops, its current show, its artists in residency and the wall project.,My  partner Jeffrey started Curbs & Stoops about 3 years ago in San  Francisco. I joined about a year ago. Jeffrey started mostly showing  street art because that work in it’s nature was accessible.  For his  first public project, he took photographs of people on the street and  provided high resolution portraits immediately online.,The  basic idea is to make fine art accessible to everyone. Sometimes the  fine art world can be really pretentious, exclusive or really expensive.   We are trying to make art accessible. If you can’t be there, we’ll  help you to be there. I often go to art shows in Manhattan and other  places, and I take pictures, blog about the shows or stream them with my  phone.  I streamed Art Basel Miami, for example. I am trying to write  in a really simple way, describing only facts, avoiding judgments, so  it’s easy for everyone to understand.,Yes,  the space in Bushwick is our physical space. Right now, only the second  floor is open, but we’re renovating the gallery space on the ground  floor around the corner and the first floor. Part of the building will  serve as studios and will also experimental exhibitions, shows and  music. The third floor will be renovated next year. And then there is a  roof with an amazing view of the city; we would like to make it viable  to  host events up there.,We opened on ,,  with five exhibitions. The first comprises of two artists who are in  residency: Rachel Labine and Jonathan Chapline.  As a part of our  residency, artists have several opportunities to show in venues in New  York including our own. Noah Becker from White Hot Magazine will come  next month to review their work. The idea is to provide them with space,  exposure, community, and positive competition. The other featured show  was a duo exhibition with Brian Maller and Sebastian Vallejo, who have  their studios here. The “Island Hoppers” show was curated in response to  the rise of artists migrating from the Carribbean Islands to New York. And the final show is called “Suspended Animation… or Animated Suspension”.,In  April we will be building a curated mural wall wrapping around the  corner. It will be curated as a gesture towards our neighborhood. Our  conversation with the city. We will invite street artists or any other  artists who are interested in exploring this venue. The first  participating artist is our friend ,,  who did the murals for the Beijing Olympic Games and whose piece on  the Berlin wall sold for half a million euro. He’s donating prints to  the first 50 people who donate $ 500 or more to our Kickstarter  campaign. You can check out our , and donate. After that, Jorge Rodriguez Gerada will be doing a large  scale charcoal drawing exploring Bushwick’s identity on our facade. That  project is still in the works.","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily. She can easily be moved by reflection of the sky in a puddle.

People,"We’re hanging out in ,. Subconsciously, my teeth are unrolling the edge of the plastic cup, while my eyes are stuck to Richard, who is sitting across the table, casually sipping his coffee while he describes how tiring life can get–if you have to attend 9 fashion shows in one day during Fashion Week. Okay, I can understand, but it’s becoming super-difficult for me to hide my excitement. This feels like I’ve just been awarded a very early Christmas gift. In the universe of a fashion junkie, Richard is a god: Richard is showing the entire skeptical crowd that, yes, indeed it is possible to make it in fashion and to live your dreams. You just need to find a way to keep doing what you’re doing and tune out the less capable “friends” who advise you to give up.,Richard Haines is one of those miraculous people in fashion who made the leap from behind a laptop screen to the front rows of top fashion shows. Richard always wanted to be a fashion illustrator, and he established himself in fashion, but somehow his dream career as an illustrator wasn’t happening. So about three years ago, he started his own blog, where he’s been posting sketches of fashionable people he meets at random–on New York streets, at work, or while he’s getting his coffee. Richard’s blog, ,, eventually became so popular that  , hired him to sketch models during Fashion Week.,As I take my photos, and between talk about ,, ,, , and ,, Richard is sketching his fashion idol, Yves Saint Laurent, from an old photograph on the wall of his Bushwick apartment. I am silently admiring his creative mess: brushes, chalks, sketch papers, fashion magazines. My eyes stop on a photo of Richard in a Burberry trench coat taken by the Sartorialist himself, Scott Schuman.,Richard loves Bushwick; it’s easy to spot him in the neighborhood riding a bike, drinking coffee in Skips, or he might ask you about the new bar around the corner from his apartment. Wherever you see him, he will be fashionably dressed and really friendly–another Bushwick artist has found his dream.","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

,It’s snowing outside.  I’m in a strange home, (not) sleeping in a strange bed. The most stressful week of the most stressful month I’ve had in years has been magnified by a factor of ten by not speaking to you for five days.,Five. Whole. Days.  Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday.  Did I say days? It feels like weeks; months. Years.,In the course of playing the cards I’ve been dealt recently, I wondered if you thought of me. I feel alone, angry, abandoned. You made a very specific request for “space” (space? we’re thousands of miles apart) and I am determined to honor it.  ”Love, honor, respect, communication, cooperation,” those are the five keys to family life, according to my Dad.  I figure the guy who pulls off the 56 year marriage gets to have some say in what works and what doesn’t.,They’re saying it’s the worst storm in New York City history. Twenty-six inches in two days. There hasn’t been this much continuous snow since the winter of 1947, the year my parents married. I wonder if there’s a correlation.,It’s hard to break the attachment to relationships, even once you know they’ve gone bad. I believe we still want the same things, we’re just not willing to go to the same lengths to get them. I changed the rules for you, broke new ground, rewrote the script; you’re unwilling to do the same. Ghosts of scarcity and not raw unchecked desire still dictate your decision making process.,I’ve enjoyed a blizzard of emotional support from family and friends, and yet, without you it all seems like snowflakes on my tongue: transient, inconsequential.  Without you, nothing matters. I have always been here to listen, encourage, guide and protect you.  I’ve sat in silence and brushed your tears away as you cried in my arms. You choose to be alone, but know this: as long as I live you never have to be.,Did you know that the Inuits of northern Canada have forty-seven words meaning “this sucks?” According to Dr. Trisha Dean “language, like other social constructs, is environmentally influenced. The vocabulary of the Inuits reflects generations of living on frigid, barren glaciers.” Tingenek: this sucks. Massalerauvok: long ago, my son, it did not suck, but that’s not really true at this time. Mauja: for many moons, it has sucked. Now is no different. Akkilokipok: it is as if the great-snow tiger of suckiness has raped my sister.,To say “this akkilokipok” feels like grand understatement; the adjective adequate to describe both this god-forsaken storm and the morass our relationship has become does not exist in English or Intuit.,I choose to walk away. Clinging to anything after it’s stop nourishing you is unhealthy, and this relationship stopped feeding my soul long, long ago. There is a famine in my heart, caused by your decision to starve me of a love you created.,Tears and snowflakes, falling until dawn.,

,This is how I felt when I entered the Bushwick home of artist Mary Judge. It was a beautiful crystal clear day; pale yellow sunlight could almost make me forget about the icy snow cracking under my feet. I met Mary just a couple of days earlier, at the opening of her current exhibition at Storefront Gallery, and now I am standing in front of her house with my index finger on the doorbell. When she opened the door, I swear that the snow in a three-foot radius melted.,She directed me to her studio. I passed flowery old-fashioned wallpaper in the hallway, a wooded banister and cracking wooden staircase, to enter a large sun-drenched room full of neatly organized tubes of paint and painting brushes. Mary’s work hangs on the walls: tender flowers in soft pastel colors. Mary explains how moved is she by nature’s objects: a stone, a tree or a flower. When I look out of the window I see the backyards of a line of houses, a swing, tall gray trees sleeping under a layer of snow. Mary smiles.,She has traveled a lot, to Europe, Asia, Australia. You can feel the influence of her journeys in her house– a Japanese door, Italian curtains. Mary teaches at Parsons and giggles when she tells me she has a great life, full of social events. My blue cup is still warm when I place it empty on her kitchen table.,

Arts and Culture,"By Natalie Keller Reinert,I’m beating her as we round the corner into the homestretch, laying my whip into her flank from high above my head, slap-slap-slap on her glossless hide. The rail is whizzing by close to my left foot, just at the height of my toe in the stirrup, and I’m dizzy with fear that my boot will rub on that hard metal rail and throw off my tenuous balance, losing what little grip I have on the little exercise saddle, or that the screech and vibration will send the horse spooking into the center of the racetrack, shaking me loose, into the dirt.,Either way it will fuck up the timed work and that is already going pretty badly. Just an eighth of a mile down, three more furlongs to go, and we’re nowhere near a racing pace. Slap-slap-slap, praying she’ll react, accelerate. Slap-slap-slap. She stumbles.,**,The horse is heaving and panting, making slow painful rounds of the rutted path of the dark crowded stable we call the shedrow. The hotwalker is texting, either his girlfriend back in Mexico or his girlfriend in Barn Four. Ordinarily I’d bitch at him, dangerous to have divided attention, that horse could spook or take off, blah blah blah, but it’s obvious that this filly’s going nowhere unless he drags her there with a chain across her lip, and anyway I’m too tired and disgusted to really give a shit about what happens to him. You can only chase these guys around so much and then it’s like, fuck it, get killed by some stud colt on ‘roid rage, see if I care. There’s a million more illegal immigrants lined up, begging for seven day a week, sixteen hour a day, way below minimum wage jobs. You’re expendable, kiddo.,I’m expendable, too, which is why I don’t go into the office to hang up my hat and safety vest for the day. I don’t need to hear Eddie give me a piece of his mind about the filly’s shit timed work, and I don’t need to hear Marcus, perched next to the heater with a Silver Bullet in his hand at nine o’clock in the morning, tell me one of his stories from his Hong Kong Jockey Club glory days.,The filly is dragging one foreleg slightly when she walks, but it’s tiny and I am the only one who will notice it.,I hang up my whip and saddle in the tack room, and stalk towards the train station still wearing my hard hat and vest.,**,C.J. Hernandez is riding her in the last race, the race the secretary writes for all the also-rans of a hundred sad slow claiming races, the race for the survivors who are looking for a little prize money before they break down. She falls at the half mile pole. She was already at the back of the pack, so no one steps on Casey. No one trips over the filly. He gets to live. A pile-up is avoided, at least for the moment. Little break-downs like this don’t even make the ,. They barely hit the blogs.,Casey gets up, brushes the clay off his white breeches, and waits for the ambulance to come and give him a ride back to the jock’s room. The filly picks up her head, and lays it back down in the dirt.,From my corner in the top of the grandstands, which hasn’t had a crowd begin enough to fill it in decades, I throw my beer bottle. It goes crashing harmlessly into the empty boxes near the balcony’s edge.,On my way out, shuffling past the cursing West Indians and the drunken old men, I see that darling of the racing board’s marketing dreams, a young girl with her well-dressed daddy. “Daddy, did that horsey die?” the girl lisps plaintively. Her father stammers.,“You better believe she died,” I tell her as I shove past.,**,But she didn’t. She’s standing in her stall the next morning, ears at half-mast, a wrapped foreleg hoisted sorrowfully over the straw. Eddie is leaning on the stall webbing, oblivious to the pigeon shit smeared over the rubber, crooning “Hey baby, come on and see your daddy, come on now babe –” Marcus is leaning against the wall drinking a Budweiser. He’s wearing a ridiculous yellow rain poncho that swamps his little ruined body, and his hard hat buckle swings loosely under his loose-skinned neck. It’s six a.m.,“She be fine in a few day,” he says to me. “She twist she ankle – no big deal.”,“She fell,” I say flatly. “Horses get up if it’s no big deal. She didn’t get up on her own.”,“Nah,” Eddie says, turning around. He smiles whitely at me. “Nah, shit, she’s just lazy. You know that. You gotta be hitting her all the time – you know she doesn’t wanna go ‘less’n you make her.”,“When I ride in Hong Kong,” Marcus says, voice gravelly with early morning alcohol, “I ride this filly, she donwanna go for no man. No man. She stop, she buck, she lay down in the dirt. I figure her out. I stand she up, let she look around, she go straight off and win for me. You gotta get inside they head.”,“You hear that?” Eddie says. “Marcus knows, he’ll help you out. Next week, get a good breeze out of her – she’ll race good then.”,“She can’t stand up,” I say skeptically.,“Oh we get her injected,” Eddie says. “That’s no problem.”,I look at the pair of them standing before the poor broken horse.,I grew up riding horses in America’s English countryside. In Virginia, in Maryland. Steeplechase horses, jumping horses, foxhunting horses. Tough, hardy horses. You knew how to treat them, how to keep them fit and strong through hard work. You never ignored a misstep, you never ran an alcohol-soaked towel over a dull coat to bring a false shine. You figured it out, and you fixed it.,This is Queens. Things are tougher here. The horses in Eddie’s shedrow are the same as the hotwalkers and the grooms and the riders: expendable. There are always more.,The filly limps into the corner of her stall and presses her face into the wall.,I can’t watch. I can’t get on anymore of these wrecks.,I won’t be able to pay my rent. I will end up on the streets. My mother will be right.,The next time she goes out, she’ll break down. And I’ll die.,I walk out.,**,She runs better the next week. She is mid-pack in a heaving mass of straining sad sore horses when she goes down. She takes three others with her.,A pile-up makes the ,Hell, it makes the New York ,.,I flip off the OTB channel.,**,There’s a four thirty a.m. A train I have to catch. I’m hotwalking for Joey Valentino in Barn Six now, and he starts work earlier. It’s a come-down from riding, but it buys bread and peanut butter. Valentino horses are gleaming and hot-tempered and mad with athleticism. They eat six meals a day, hand-mixed by a laughing, singing Jamaican man who has been working at racetracks since he was 12 years old. He says. Valentino horses don’t break down in cheap races. They don’t go down and die. He retires them to be jumpers, kid’s horses, pasture pets. He won’t put me on a single one of them, says I’m not good enough for his horses, but he’ll let me walk them and hose them off, and I take the job.,The siren on the racetrack goes off, and everyone in the barn does an instinctive head count of their horses. Do we have anyone out there? Could that be one of ours?,Everyone is in the barn; we were between sets of working horses. Rafael goes out to the fence to investigate. The siren can mean “loose horse” or “break-down.” It means the bored paramedics, listening to the radio in their ambulance, have work to do. It means everyone unfortunate enough to have a horse between their legs or in their grasp had better hold on tight in case something fast and loose goes galloping by.,Before Rafael comes back, the PA system crackles, sending my horse into a spasm of idiocy, and I hear, through my struggles, “Any available vet please report to the track.”,That’s it, then. Someone broke down.,The siren wails for a very long time. We’re all conscious of it, even as our horses settle and begin to walk semi-sanely again.,Rafael comes back inside. “Eddie Vernon’s gray horse. He die. And Marcus to the hospital.”,“Marcus?” I ask.,“Marcus riding he horses this week.” He looks at me. “Hey – you ride for Eddie before.”,“Yeah,” I say, jiggling the shank of my horse’s lead to keep him occupied. “Yeah, that gray horse, that’s Melodytime.”,“He die, that’s no good. Sorry.”,**,Eddie comes looking for me after training hours. I’m hosing out feed tubs, giving all the leftover oat hulls to the pigeons and the rats.,“Melodytime die out there today.”,“Yeah, I heard,” I say.,“Marcus broke his arm, his collarbone.”,“Yeah.”,“I need you.”,“No.”,“Come on.” Wheedling.,I don’t look away from my feed buckets. It could have been me. It would have been me.,Do you also wanna see your work published in Sunday Read? ,.",,"fiction,Natalie Keller Reinert,Sunday Read","

Opinion,"I woke up on a recent Saturday about 3 hours late. I had a note in my calendar to drop off the forgotten clutches of a dear designer friend from Boston, ,, back at her place around the corner, before cocooning myself back into my comforters and dealing with what was was amounting to be a three-day hangover.,I was awakened to her texting me: “Are you coming? I have to go to an art opening in 30 min.”,I jump into my non-pants while I balance my morning yerba matté on the sink, as I hurriedly brush my teeth, I start feeling akin to , from that British clay animation comedy I used to watch when I was 14, and stoned.,I call her. “What’s this show thing about? Never mind. I’ll pick you up in 20min, I’m coming.” It turned out to be the same , I’d gone to with friends, to see some sort of interpretive performance about occult symbolism or cult symbols–in the rectory of the church.,This time the show was about sound; appropriately titled “Sequence of Waves,” and it was quite loud. Here are a couple of shots I captured on my phone.,After climbing through a tiny tree house installation straddling one T intersection of the third floor of this rented out church building, I found one small, spiraling staircase leading down into what felt like a space between the floorboards.,It was very difficult to orient myself, I had to stoop to fit down the stairs, through a tiny glass door, which led to a paper-måchéd crawlspace, which in turn led to what looked like the newsprint-covered inside of an igloo.,Ten feet in diameter, the igloo’s center was tall enough to stand up straight, but there were others there too, so there was little room to stretch.,Sitting down, I noticed the sheets of paper covering the walls, the black charcoal spread over the upper two thirds, and the giant prismatic cross hanging, illuminated in front of us.,Once I made it through the tiny treehouse, on the third floor of the building at the end of a hallway, I saw one of my favorite installations. I think it was the only room to use natural light, which left me curious about its nighttime appearance.,Initially striking, details such as using various double-shot glasses with logos turned toward the back of the room made me pause and take a look around trying to locate traces of the artists. I found a disheveled girl standing in the corner, occasionally greeting acquaintances with quiet exclamations in the form of fragments, on the subject of meditation. I thought it was an accurate paradigm of the show.,I had some chai and salad back at Maya’s place in between breaths of encouragement about creating an installation at St. Cecilia’s Church for her next collection. I petted her roommate’s giant grey cat  as I  gathered strength to face the evening. I was going to the performance space and art gallery , I’d been hearing about lately.,I hadn’t looked at the program so I was quite surprised to walk into a minimal [compared to the afternoon affair] solo show by Steven Thompson. It brought me back to my friend’s senior sculpture project at Mass Art, which comprised only a wooden bench with pliers, large ,, and half taxidermied bits of animal husks. I looked around the room for evidence of fine art, and spotted a light beige garment hanging from the ceiling in the front room. “That’s awesome,” I mumbled as I walked past it on my way to inquire about the absence of wine. Long after leaving, the feeling of the bright overhead light penetrates my thoughts as I grasp for a greater meaning of the artwork, and I am still convinced that the answer lies exclusively in the poncho, or an interview; whichever I get my hands on first.,Check out the panoramic walk-through I shot on my phone, while at English Kills.,Also, check out my ,; sometimes I write stuff.",,"Curious Wednesday,English Kills,ms. marquise,St. Cecilia's Gallery","

,Bushwick Daily chatted recently with Jason Andrew, a Bushwick resident, curator, and everlasting art enthusiast. Jason runs the Storefront gallery, and curates a number of art, dance and literary events; he also works on his home-based gallery and maintains a daily gallery job. We talked about beginnings of ,, ,, and ,.,Right now we’re showing Mary Judge. This is her first show in New York in two years, and her first show since she moved to Bushwick. She lives around the corner. In the back room we have a show called Wavelength, featuring three artists: Judith Braun, Maureen McQuillan and Susanna Starr.,The newest project, which I am really excited about, was started by my gallery manager, Kate Wadkins, and it’s called ,, the zine department. I’ve always been a big collector of handmade artist’s zines. We will hopefully have a party every month celebrating a new zine. It will probably take over the monthly literary readings we used to have. I like the idea of giving zines a larger presence in the gallery.,I bought a house in upstate New York, and there isn’t a lot of art. As a New Yorker for almost 18 years before I moved, I wanted to bring art there, so I started a non-profit called Norte Maar. I organized a major ballet there with Julia Gleich, my collaborator and a co-founder of Norte Maar. We rented an ice-skating rink and converted it into a ballet theatre and invited a lot of friends.,
I moved back to the city when I got a job in a gallery as the manager and curator of Jack Tworkov. I came to Bushwick looking for affordable housing, like all of us (,). That was late 2006.  I walked into this apartment, where we’re sitting right now, and I thought immediately that this beautiful room works really well as a gallery, especially because of its proximity to the street and because of its natural light. So I started doing salon projects here: I would invite a group of artists, we would hang art and have a dinner party.,Later Norte Maar started to partner with ,, which produces the Bushwick Open Studios event. I mounted a show for that featuring three artists: Rico Gatson, Andrew Hurst and Amanda Trager. Through Arts in Bushwick, I became even more involved in sponsoring projects in Bushwick.  There were a lot of pop-up spaces and home galleries like Norte Maar, and Bushwick doesn’t really have a regular scene or a gallery stroll. So I started Beat Nite, which helps raise the visibility of Bushwick’s galleries. (The next one is February 18).,We started mounting exhibitions here in my apartment four times a year or more, and it grew to capacity. It was just too many people in my apartment, and there are only so many times your toilet will flush in one evening, it was just a lot…,
There is no separation between me and what I do, my projects, and promoting artists. We started to do ballets here and other modern dance projects, where I had some performing artists work in this space and everything was projected into the street. There were speakers, and people would walk by and watch their performance.,One of the artists I really wanted to show was Deborah Brown. She was working on a series of paintings called Bushwick Paintings and in this space I can only hang two or three paintings. And her paintings were pretty large, so we started to look around for a space that I could rent for a month. Deborah found the Storefront space and thought it would be a really great space to open a gallery. But it’s one thing to have an apartment gallery where you don’t have to go to work and pay rent. At that point I had never really thought about opening my own gallery. It seemed like it was impossible, but I decided to go with Deborah, and we opened Storefront. And we just celebrated our first year!","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily. She can easily be moved by reflection of the sky in a puddle.

Hell is carrots, you say at 12 am. I don’t think you mean it.,
The glistening wine that fizzles out of your lips,
when sleep congregates for other people, when the pillow,

for your hand and the eye drops don’t seem to ease the itching.,You weep like a baby in my arms and I stroke your cold fingers,
as if you are some whiskey-soaked kitten here for the warmth.,
I hold you and your head rages, the sinner inside you wails,

finally does you in.,
I want a woman with freckles,
dripping in her skin like a leopard’s coat,
like sunlight spotting the verdant earth,I want to name the constellations on her face,
claim her with titles reserved for the skies,
navigate her unknown terraces like Magellan crossed the seas,

Music,"As I jump over a slushy puddle, I cross boroughs–from Bushwick, Brooklyn to Ridgewood, Queens. I am headed to Cypress Avenue where Chasidy, John and Donie rehearse on Friday nights. Listening to their freshly pressed EP on my iPod, I’m thrilled as I imagine how they will sound live.,Vividly Dim and are true locals. Chasidy, the band leader and princess, explains enthusiastically that she was born and raised in Bushwick,near Knickerbocker, and talks about how much things have changed. She vividly describes the sweet smell coming from a candy factory next door and how she used to get free candy at Christmas. Her grandma still lives in the same apartment–but the candy factory building has been subdivided into lofts.,I’m tagging along on a Wednesday afternoon while the gang is headed to Evergreen Park. It feels so nice, being part of the crew for an afternoon. The walk is hazardous: the snow occasionally drops from the rooftops, and the puddles are filled with thin pieces of ice. It feels like digging my spoon into a crème brulee when my step cracks the crust that has formed on the piles of snow overnight.  John and Donie are exemplary gentlemen, helping Chas and me. Chas and John have been in love for a long time now, and Donie, a tall guy in a Matrix-like black coat is their dear, remarkable friend and bandmate.,Evergreen Park is the Vividly Dim’s beloved spot. This is where they love to hang out when the weather is nice, and where they wrote most of their songs–while daydreaming, listening to Nirvana, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Sade or even Michael Jackson.,
The band finished the long-overdue EP during the snowstorm, but noted that the extra time they spent taught them so much about music and about each other.  Now seems like the right time for the new music to drop, because things are starting to happen for them. DJs and radio stations have been reaching out; they’ve doubled the number of Facebook fans; and they’re playing a show on Friday; and their EP release party is this Friday, at Good Bye Blue Monday.,We leave the park and head to Ridgewood Eats, the band’s favorite eatery. Over sweet-potato fries, the guys start laughing as they  tell me that they can’t describe the genre of their music. Independent? Rock? Even gothic was in play. Vividly Dim has become popular among Goths and Vamps–something the band appreciates, but doesn’t quite understand.  I feel a touch of eclectic and world music in their sound.

Arts and Culture,"By Maria Modrovich,Boats are out these days. You fly in.,You are mildly appalled by the drive from the airport. Really, these are the yellow cabs? Someone must’ve been eating a baguette in the back seat before you got in. Also, you can’t help thinking the driver is a member of a terrorist group. When he chats, it’s to distract you, when he’s on the phone, it’s to get instructions. You try to come across as amiable.,You wanted a cheap , nice hotel, this shithole looks nothing like the pictures on the website. You can’t understand a word the receptionist says. What a moron.,You let everyone know the coffee is terrible. Watery, without substance. Where can a person get a decent cappuccino around here?,You flaunt your clothes; you’ve got balls to be different. And to wear a little hat.,You’re armed with a Not-For-Tourists city guide and you know exactly what you want to see. You’re surprised how many people know about the best-kept secrets of the city. After you boxed your way through the crowded isles of Century 21, you decide to have a drink somewhere offbeat, like the Meatpacking District.,When you order beer, you stubbornly pronounce the name in Hochdeutsch, Praguer-Czech or wannabe Belgium. You also, also stubbornly, order from the busboy. He doesn’t understand a word you’re saying. You immediately add the boy’s ethnic group to the group of morons who are on Earth to make life living hell for you. Now you understand why this country is in crisis.,Your local connection suggests you meet on Avenue C. You ask if that’s in the city center. By city center you mean the area around your cheap and not-so-nice hotel in Times Square. You ponder whether your local connection is a bit on the moronic side, too, since incapable of answering your question.,The place you like most is Pain Quotidian, the one near you. You have breakfast there and afternoon coffee; its universality gives you an almost homey feeling. Couldn’t you meet there?,You walk to the East Village and arrive 50 minutes late. You’re stunned it took you so long. On the map, it looked like it was really close. And you really are a fast walker.,You don’t tip. One, the service is either moronic or annoyingly servile; two, where you come from, rounding off is considered generous. Why should you care about the local wages? Why change , habits? They’re supposed to be appreciative you came over here to spend money. Don’t they even start you on the hotel standard.,While sipping your Weizenbier, you like to discuss politics. So much shit in the Middle East. Why exactly did America intervene in Kosovo? And how does one win the Noble price for Peace with climate change? You bask in the shame of your American friends. They’re lucky to have you – to teach them to be critically aware.,Has anything been left in Egypt? You wonder out loud. Yes, you’ve been to the MET. For an art connoisseur like you it is a must. Although, compared to D’Orsay, Louvre, Tate, …, you know, what more is there to see, really.,On the way back to the hotel, you avoid the subway. You’ve seen pictures of it – they were in an art show – all graffiti and weird people; no trust has been built between you and the underground transportation. Someone might try to blow it up.,You walk about ten blocks in the opposite direction before you realize it. You are afraid of people mumbling to themselves.,You agree to take the F this time. You hold your bag close to your body with both hands. You can still remember how your camera got stolen in the middle of the day on Rambla. You wouldn’t want to be on this train, with these characters, after dark; that’s for sure. The guy sitting across the isle from you has innumerous mirror pieces attached to his ragged clothing; they’re flashing you when his meaty body jerks in the seat as the car moves. He’s smiling, you are afraid it’s at you. You run up the stairs into the daylight when the train stops.,It takes exactly one hundred and seventy eight pictures of Katz Deli and various fire staircases until you get to the place where you’re meeting your friends. It’s shocking to find out that everyone, just like you, is wearing plaid and boots. And a little hat.,After 15 minutes of close observation you start to feel inadequate. Their shirts are much more … audacious!  (Audacious is a word you learned from an essay on short stories that the professor of your Fiction I class had you read). In a painful moment of insight, you grasp that you’re sporting the plaid of seasons past. This throws you into a brief but deep depression, forcing you to inquire about the best, like, out-of-the-mainstream boutiques.,Thank god you’ve got your talent. You came here to make it, nothing less than that. Who would’ve guessed these people actually had things to add to your little lecture on Chekhov’s ,. You thought they were all just waiting tables.,For a moment, you ponder whether to give it a second shot with ,, but you decide to stick to chain-smoking your Marlboro Lights, informing everyone how criminally overpriced the smokes are and how fucking restricting the No-Smoking policy is. Good old truly liberal continent that you come from.,You laugh maliciously at a pair of French tourists who try to figure out where the Saturday Q train has taken them. When they ask if you could recommend a nice place for lunch, you advice them to go to PQ, pronouncing ‘pain’ as the English word for ‘sore.’,On the way from the train to the Polish restaurant, you pay no attention to the filigree staircases (although you kind of want to). You feel good; your shirt and skinny jeans are as hip as they get at Urban Outfitters.,First of all, you get coffee. A large coffee, please. In a mug.,You curse every foreign asshole that doesn’t tip you. Didn’t they read the guides? Why do they even bother coming here? Everybody knows waiters live off their tips.,Hello, no, you can’t smoke here. It doesn’t matter that it’s outside. There’s a marquee over your head (asshole!).,Finally, your shift is over.,You know you have almost made it; a few more weeks and the agent you flirted with at the Independent Lit Press Bar Ball will surely call to tell you how much they loved your manuscript.

Alicia is wearing a Lil’ Kim T-shirt and a long skirt. She throws a tequila shot into her insides, bites into a thin, dry slice of lime and yells: “You have to give your piece away. You have to get distance from it, so that you can look at it objectively, and we can create something amazing as a group.” , and I are looking at her painting: a sassy, dirty black-haired woman, licking her lips, maybe she even resembles Alicia. “XOXO”, the painting says at the bottom. That is how Alicia answered a request for a “,.”,Scene 2,This is most probably the coldest night in my personal history of Brooklyn. I’m slowly freezing to death as I’m walking towards the McKibbin lofts.  Alicia almost comes out into the street to greet me at the loft elevator, barefoot. She’s laughing about the absurd cold.

Arts and Culture,"We are showing the works of film, video, sound, and other-time based artists.  Not only their films or videos etc, but also other objects. There is no message, other that these such artists works should be shown and collected just as sculpture, paintings and drawings have been. It took a while for photography to be accepted and I think it is the same with these newer forms.,The exhibition is called “Eye Transgress” and includes a series of 20 new paintings, new video, sculpture, drawings and other works by Nick Zedd. Nick is a legendary underground figure of the Lower East Side cinematic revolution “Cinema of Transgression”, a term he coined. He calls the paintings “Entities,” and they are manifestations of his “Theory of Xenomorphosis” – which is hard to explain briefly – but it argues that shocking images can transform more than the mind. He talks about the possibility of a super-evolutionary process leading to mutation through the injection of an alien genetic code. These paintings are also influenced by images of real infants born with a rare and usually fatal skin condition, so it’s a intersection of these two ideas.,I don’t like saying who is the next hot thing, because I don’t like to single out one artist. There are many artists that have been known for years and those are some really serious artists, but the art world catches up only years later. Take Jonas Mekas for example. He is 88 and has been making groundbreaking films since the 1960’s. Andy Warhol came to him to learn about films and the art world is starting to really recognize him only now.

Arts and Culture,"By Zuzana Kepplova,Meeting a vegan in the early nineties in Central Europe was an event comparable to a solar eclipse. I had the honor to meet one in person while taking part in an organized trip to the Baltic Republics. Fellow trip takers were so stunned by the presence of a vegan on the bus that they would stand in line at the bus alley to talk to her. They would share their food with the vegan and watch her eat it. The nights spent camping by the Baltic Sea were cold and the vegan refused to eat cooked food. So, people would bring her cups of wine, warmed up with their own hands. The vegan was permanently drunk. And constantly cold. Everyone was ultra protective of her. She was so pale and pure that one glass of wine was enough to make her drunk. Like a hermaphrodite in ancient Rome, she was special.,When the bus made a shopping stop, the mothers would send their kids to go check what the vegan was getting. The kids would run up to the vegan girl and more or less discretely inspect her shopping basket. Before anybody was allowed to touch their food, the parents would discuss whether this or that would be good for the vegan. The kids were sent to the vegan with small samples of food. Often, she would decline with a mild hand gesture and the kid would run back to inform the family that the vegan only wants nuts and wine.,The vegan had allergies to certain types of nuts. While our bus was passing by the beautiful white sand beaches of Riga, the adults were whispering the names of forbidden nuts. The fathers would write them down into their leather-bound notepads and the mothers would memorize their names. When by the fireplace, only the strongest young people with perfect teeth could sit around the vegan while she was telling the tale of her life. She was a second-generation vegan in the then Czechoslovakia. Something that was nearly unheard of. The menopausical women fainted and the people with high blood pressure were asked to leave and not listen from their tents. The kids were sound asleep by then and there was a changing guard making sure that they would leave their tents only when they urgently needed to use the toilette.,This is the moment when I would like to proudly announce that I was a personal friend of the vegan. I was near her when she ate and I assisted with the bottle opening. However, I remember only very little because the vegan was kind enough to share her wine with me. Those were very merry times.,Now, I would like to ask all the menopausical women to sit down and breathe evenly. Please, make sure there is no one with high blood pressure around or let them continue only at their own risk. Because the secret of the vegan’s shopping basket follows. It was full of the food the others would only touch after dinner was finished and the menopausical women made sure that everyone had at least three pieces of cake. The basket was full of FRUIT and NUTS; something that the mothers would encourage their children to throw to birds in zoos. And men were allowed to touch it only when soaked in alcohol. I remember an old history teacher mentioning that humanoids ate fruit and nuts.  He then wiped his thick-framed glasses and took out a schnitzel out of his lunch box.,I will be completely honest with you. I, the personal friend of the second-generation vegan, tasted some of her food. Under the influence of alcohol, deep in the forests of Estonia, while the moon was the only light, I had a bit of dried fruit and unsalted nuts. I do not want to speak about it anymore. Sometimes, when I bake and use these ingredients, I think of her ghostly cold white hands. We shared a tent during that trip. She was talking to me freely, addressing any topic without restrictions. I would listen carefully and make extra effort to assure that my response would amuse her.  I barely slept to make sure her blanket is in place…,An average looking man in jogging wear enters a café in the Village and ask for a vegan coffee. The man gets exactly the same paper cup of regular drip no milk just like me, only I wasn’t seeking attention by calling it vegan. People in this city have no shame at all. At parties, people approach me casually claiming they are vegans, munching on nuts and sipping regular coffee. They say, in a loud unpleasant voice:  “I cannot eat muffins! There’s milk and eggs in muffins. I’m a vegan!” And other people join: “I’m a vegan, too!” “Me too, I’m a vegan!” The room is often full of them. They inspect the muffins, spill milk into the sink and aggressively exchange recipes. “Who brought the muffins?”, they shout unanimously.,Let this be the moment of truth. I baked the muffins. I used two large non-organic eggs and a cup of watery milk. The recipe is freely available on the Internet. You have to type , into Google. I had to close the curtains while baking them. I went to a special non-vegan grocery store open only every other Sunday. And if you want to buy me a drink, get me an eggnog or a White Russian, please. I’ll be your personal friend.

These photographs are the first installment of his work in progress series. With a Holga with PanX125 120mm film Ray captures Bushwick’s landmarks that are hiding a piece of history.,Not too many people know nowadays that until the night of July 13, 1977, when a major blackout occurred in New York City, Bushwick was experiencing a retail and residential flourish. However, arson, looting, and vandalism followed the Blackout. Bushwick saw some of the most devastating damages and losses. While local owners in the predominantly Puerto Rican Knickerbocker Avenue and Graham Avenue shopping districts were able to defend their stores with force, suburban owners with stores on the Broadway shopping district saw their shops looted and burned. Twenty-seven stores along Broadway had burned. Only unsafe dwellings and empty lots were left after the riots among surviving buildings. Bushwick was left with a lack of both retail stores and housing. Residents who could afford to leave abandoned the area. The neighborhood became a hotbed of poverty and crime through the 1980s…,

Arts and Culture,"It has become a good Bushwick tradition that every third Saturday in month, all the good-writing-and-other-arts admirers meet up in , and are enjoying a group placebo effect of a large projected fireplace. So did we last night and I swear that during the fourth edition of the Bushwick Finest reading series, I felt the warmth and I could smell the burning wood more than ever. Maybe it was because the most wanted duo in the literary Bushwick, Mike Lala and Eric Nelson announced that Fireside Follies came into its finale… I know, I know… But remember: “Big girls don’t cry!” so I won’t cry and you shouldn’t either. Besides, Mike and Eric promised to come up with “something huge” this spring, so let’s see if they can beat their own success. Honestly, they won’t have an easy job; during its four editions Fireside Follies multiplied the number of the people in the audience several times, the line up was constantly awesome, and Mike and Eric were simply funny.,
,This month’s all-star lineup included a poet Tom Oristaglio, a novelist Justin Taylor, a comic artist Julia Wertz, a poet Eileen Myles and a novelist Arthur Nersesian. Writer Andy Smith who we saw reading on Fireside Follies #3 came as a DJ this time.,Tom Oristaglio reciting his poetry.  And if I were way cornier than I actually am, I’d say: Pay attention to this your poet, for he’s got the fire in his blood. In the best Fireside Follies’ tradition. But obviously, I am not , corny.,The second to read comes Justin Taylor. The author of ,r and ,a novel coming out next month.,The comic artist Julia Wertz is super funny! Make sure to check out her autobiographical comics  ,y (before she changes the name!). ﻿,
,Eileen Myles, the author of a poet novel , reads a joint poem with her girlfriend ,. Yup, the cutest couple of the night. By far.,The last to read is the author of 9 novels, Arthur Nersesian.,It was pretty crowded in the audience….,

,PS: For those of you who think that the loss of Fireside Follies might be more tha they could handle right now and the transition period to the new literary experience might be tough, I conducted an independent , research and found this video for you, which might ease the pain, at least partially ,

In the Hood,"Well… right here, from the top of the page, I should probably warn every lost soul surfing the internets instead of panicking somewhere on Meserole Street in loads of snow due the increasing celebration insanity… I am listening to nostalgic, smootchi, fuzzy, my-puppy-got-lost type of music. It sorta brings me to reflect on 2010 and on where I am going, who am I, whether I’m enough and whether the world is enough (I mean, it can’t be just me, it has to be also them). And what about mankind? I might even shed a tear for the orphans in Chad…,In any case, 2010 was crazy. Painfully crazy. Full of ups and downs. And I have astrology to explain this. Apparently, it wasn’t entirely easy for the most of us and it’s the universe to be blamed for the turbulences. Despite it all, there is one decision that I tend to call the “Decision of 2010” and that is moving to Bushwick. Out-of-Bushwick residents tend to blow Bushwick off, because the streets are not as pretty as, let’s say, Greenpoint. (At this point, I would like to make a small tiny point that among all the mess you can find on the streets, some items may be violently inspirational for photography, painting or simply for funny conversations with your friends. But that’s not what I want to write about). Bushwick isn’t about ugly streets, houses or the M train. Bushwick is mainly about the people and their stories; about inspiration; about being a bit naïve and going against the rationale of the strict uptight world. It is about hope, hope to make it, hope to do something meaningful with your life and spending some good time while at it. Bushwick is about inspiring others and letting others inspire you. Bushwick is about community. Unlike other places, Bushwick can still cherish the community sense and the people supporting and carrying about each other. And I am more than happy to be part of it and to be able to do my share by writing about what’s going on in the neighborhood. Bushwick Daily started like a simple photo blog, but is quickly becoming more than that. The site is becoming a platform for people to exchange their ideas. It is also a window for people who are contemplating a move to the neighborhood or others who are simply curious about what is being cooked in Bushwick. Furthermore, after the 1, contributor Pepe Lopez, also others of you expressed an interest to join me in creating the content. I heard completely awesome ideas and I cannot wait for 2011 to make it happen!,To conclude this post before I start crying and cause some irreparable damage to my laptop keyboard, I’d like to thank to all ,:,musician, tap dancer and Bushwick’s most favorite alien ,,,great story teller, blogger & writer ,,,amazing coffee shop co-owner & the greatest sweetie ,,,amazing Bushwick people’s soul thief & photographer ,,,punk ziner, writer & Fireside Follies co-curator ,,,musician, host & the prototype of a Bushwick resident ,,,always cheerful and curious photographer ,,,artistic coffee creator & the saddest eyes painter ,,,essayist & frequent awesomeness embracer ,,,(and a true beast, Quel Beast).,Many thanks go to Bushwick musicians ,,,,,and ,!,So let’s get this party started and may 2011 be the Year!","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

,The third installment of ,, Bushwick’s most beloved monthly reading series, was simply great fun! With the pride own to my Bushwick heart, I have to say that Fireside Follies is becoming an awesome cultural event and a show-view of art being created (not only) in Brooklyn. After last night, Fireside Follies are officially not only about readings, but also about music, visual arts and omnipresent community sense. When Eric Nelson and Mike Lala, the curators, introduced ,, a singer and an autoharp angelic tunes player, I felt a little bit like I was taken back in time to San Francisco in the 1950s, I swear I nearly stood up from my chair and yelled: “Yeah, guys, let’s do it; let’s merge the arts together; let’s get rid of the concept of the forms of art and let’s get mutually inspired.” Just like ,, does it. Katelan is a visual artist, a writer, she is a member and a founder of several artists collectives and a drug prevention activist.,Last night’s line up included Brandon Lake, a poet extraordinaire from South Philly, who presented his visual poem – a set of double exposure black and white photographs.,

Music,"The Industrial poetry of Meserole Street is smudged when I sprint past by the warehouse where the guys from Navegante rehearse every day. “It’s all in your head”, Jean Shepherd, yells in my headphones. It feels like there is a fourth dimension to their music. Short breath, my feet are in monotone frequency touching and untouching the ground. Inhale, exhale, wet hair underneath my hood, I am driven by the energy and restlessness of ,.,You’re tired and drunk when walking home late at night and/or early morning. Thoughtlessly, you take a short cut through the warehouse area in Bushwick. That’s not your habitual route home, but some inexplicable force is taking you there. Too tired to fight it, you just follow. Smell of dirt, rain is mixing with the smell of boiling rice. You take a peak through a large hole in the wall of the rice factory. There are a hundred people dancing, going insane, rough music rolling from a large speaker. Your ear canals are vibrating, your eyes stuck to the florescent photographs on the walls. You melt into the crowd… ,.,Jean hands me a roll of toilet paper as I am sitting in their studio. “I strongly advise you to put it into your ears. Cause this might get loud…”, he smiles friendly. I briefly look at Wash Duke behind the drums waiting impatiently to start and obediently fill up my ears. Suddenly everything changes, the air vibrates, Navegante fills up their rented space to 120% percent with energy. I can’t stop looking at Wash smashing his drum set. I feel like I am observing some secret spiritual ritual, like I’m invading his intimacy.,Once the set is over, their faces change, just like nothing happened. I begin to be curious about why there are only two of them. Jean explains that they used to have more members, but as the time passed it turned out that it’s not entirely easy to find people who share their mind set. The people who are willing to put everything aside and focus just on music for a year and half. It takes time and self-discipline. “It’s all in your head.”, I am thinking about their song. They played for a year in a club in East Harlem. To find their sound and to practice. “Playing live makes you think quick. What do you do when something goes wrong? You have one second to fix it when on a stage.” I am asking about Brooklyn clubs. Jeans says that when he moved to Brooklyn, he was amazed by the quality of the bands playing in Brooklyn. The clubs would pay one band to play the whole night and they better be amazing. Nowadays, there are so many bands out there that the clubs are booking four or more bands per night and they don’t care how the band sounds like because the bands are basically required to pay for their own show. And the quality goes down rapidly.,The guys further explain that they have created this effective 30-minute long set to open Rye Rye’s show ,. This will be their last show for some time now. They plan to disappear for the winter in their Meserole studio and finish their second album. To taste a hint of what is coming, you can download their , or come to Public Assembly on Wednesday.","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

She has been spending all her time in a studio working with the technicians Rob Guariglia and Scott Harris, who besides the fact that are Elli’s great friends are responsible for Elli’s single “Standing in Place” that will be released in January. Elli gives me her iPhone headphones and lets me listen to it. It’s sweet, beautifully polished, and Elli has never sounded better. “This single just might be it…” I’m thinking.,It’s a late fall afternoon, and the air is cold, making our noses red when we reach the People’s Garden. It’s a garden like I’ve always wanted to find, a garden I used to read about in my childhood books, but I never knew of its existence, until now… Definitely, I wasn’t anticipating it in Bushwick.

She’s staring at me as a silent witness of a near impracticability of finding someone compatible with you and even if you do find that person, you have to let them go most times for many reasons.,Women are the most frequent motive of drawings and the source of the deepest emotions of James Marshall. Eyes of each of them transmit a different vibe. From mother, through a good friend to his latest infatuation…,James draws them with pastels, charcoal, ink, sometimes with water colors and assorted pencils.  He says there is something indisputably elegant about drawing the line of hair with one line. James developed his technique purely empirically and through experimentation. He is fascinated by Francesco Clemente.  He never went to art school and is proudly self-taught: “Art school is good in teaching you the business of art, but who are they to teach you how to feel your art?” James says it took him some time to accept the title “artist”, bringing him to reflections on what is art and what does it mean to be an artist. Does it mean you have a diploma from a fancy art school hanging in your bed room? Surely not. Despite being a very loyal Bushwick resident, James is an individualist and doesn’t identify himself with the art scene of Morgantown. Instead, he derives a lot of inspiration from the concurrent music scene.,James was born in the Appalachian Mountains. His mom, who used to be a hippie, has been a great influence on him. He spent 2 years of his life traveling in the States, camping and attending conferences and seminars of the non-violence movement. Afterwards, in the very hippie fashion, he arrived penniless to Bushwick to pursue his art.,To see the series of drawings of James Marshall, come to ,, where James will have an exhibition starting on December 10.","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

People,"“Wait… I’ll show you…. this photo….”, Rafael Fuchs is going through a slightly disorganized pile of framed photographs leaning on the wall in his Bushwick studio. You can end up looking for Rafael’s studio just like a grandma looks for her glasses that are sitting on her nose. The building on Bogart Street clearly and phlegmatically says one word: “fuchs”.,It’s kinda hard to believe that a man who created the brand ,, photographed Mike Stipe, Pink, Collin Powell or J.K. Rowling, exhibited his work in Ace Gallery or Ad Hoc, and won numerous photo awards is hanging out on Moore Street, buying organic vegetables in a store near Morgan stop and making amateur videos of Die Antwoord who came to Bushwick for a photo shoot. But yeah, here he is… A bit absent minded, super friendly, curious, inspired by every single detail and excited about life.,“Ah, here it is. So look at it…”, Rafael takes off the bubble wrap paper from a large photograph and sticks it right in front of my nose. I see a guy, doing a victory sign standing on a roof somewhere downtown Manhattan. “Hm”, I am a bit puzzled. It takes a couple of seconds for my brain to recognize everything in the photo. There are the twin towers burning behind the man on the rooftop. I feel cold sweat and shivers running down my spine. I realize how provoking the photograph can be. Rafael explains that some galleries love the , and some are offended by it. Rafael says that the man in the picture is showing two fingers not for victory, but for two towers being down. What is a better portrayal of New York life than reactions and gestures of a bunch of people randomly hanging out on a rooftop on Bleecker Street, while an event that we couldn’t comprehend is happening at the background?,I look at the American flag casually folded and sitting on a chair in the corner… Rafael Fuchs isn’t about big words, statements and patriotism. Rafael Fuchs, originally from Israel, is living his life the way it comes. Day after day, minute after minute… He consumes what America serves. His book,  , a collection of raw unprocessed photographs taken throughout Rafael’s extensive travels, is evidencing this.,While I am looking at the photographs on the walls of his studio, Rafeal is cooking. I protest that I am not hungry, but Rafael, with his ,dismisses me like a kid who doesn’t know what’s good for her. “I studied holistic health. One should eat well. It’s very important to eat roots.”, and I have to admit, Rafael clearly knows what he is doing.,As much as he travels, he always loves to come back to ,, between the warehouses and factories where the home is. He adores the neighborhood, he loves how vast it is, he likes how you meet much fewer people on the streets than in Manhattan, which allows you to get to know them way better.","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

Arts and Culture,"The time flies by quickly. I couldn’t believe it’s been a month since I attended the first of the , reading series. My feet were taking me down the familiar route “warehouse on the right, warehouse on the left” to my most favorite fire place in Bushwick, ,.,Mike Lala and Eric Nelson, the co-perpetrators of the finest Bushwick reading series, were tempting all the bookworms to come by a stellar constellation of readers: ,, ,, ,, Danniel Schooneebek, and Alyson Paty.,Cassandra Katsiaficas is a founding member of Numu Arts Collective, poet, painter, jewelry and big plans maker.,
,Danniel Schooneebek and Alyson Paty have a collaboration poetry project going on. They write so called “torch poems”. Each of them separately writes 5 lines without discussing it before hand to come up with a sentimental unrequited love poem. In addition, both Danniel and Alyson read their own poems. Danniel frequently experiments with form. His work includes poems in the form of itinerary, manifesto or apology.,Melissa Broder is a shiny poet star! She reads couple of poems, some from her book ,, and some that were published elsewhere. To listen to Melissa’s poems is like to hold two fingers on the pulse of the city life, todayness, sarcasm, pop culture and generation of 20 something.,
,Christy Road sits in the front row. She is a punk with Cuban origins. She is holding her latest illustrated novel ,, manuscript of her upcoming piece and a laptop. She explains how ,is an autobiography. It’s s story of a gay woman from a Cuban family recovering from an abusive heterosexual relationship coming to New York. While reading, Christy projects her illustrations. Her confession takes me aback with its frankness, Christy is direct, simply describing reality the way it is without any pathos or sentiments, causing me shivers on the spine. Her illustrations remind me of a comic noir, enhancing the effect of the story. Christy is true and has so much to tell through visual arts inspired into writing.,
,Saturdays Fireside Follies made me happy, indicating the way it could follow – in line with the spirit of the neighborhood, exploding with truthfulness, creativity, confession, new forms, exploration, extreme, erasing the line between the forms of art.,(Similar content appears on ,)","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

,You’re ,, , and ,. Your , doesn’t let you sleep at night. You don’t care about food, sleep, clothes or love, because , is the only thing that matters right now. And you know you have to do it; give a tangible form to all that’s inside of you…,
You probably live in , and you keep bumping into people with the same vibe all the time. Sometimes you think you must be going mad right at this moment, because it’s in the air. It buzzes, the neighborhood vibrates, you feel it with every step, you feel it with every portion of oxygen you fill up your lungs with. There are many amazing things to be created.,There are bands spending their food money on recording studios. Rehearsing in the basement all the time. Going crazy when they get to play a show. That’s why we’re beginning a cycle about ,. Connect to bands and musicians that are about to happen right now…, are a cult Bushwick rock-and-roll trio. Frank Rathbone, the frontman, guitar player and a vocalist says they met about two years ago. “John Swanson, the drummer, moved to my building and on the very same day we met on the stairs, I asked him to play a show with me. And he said yes.” Later on, at a show of some lame band, Frank met Gillian Visco, the bass player and a vocalist. “The band sucked,” says Frank, “but Gillian was super-excited about their pink bass. And so I asked her if she wants to play a bass in my band.” “And I said that I can’t play bass”, Gillian joins the conversation. “But Frank said: Sure you can. And I was like: Really? and I was so happy at that moment.” And that’s it.,
They have an amazing chemistry among them. All three of them compose their songs. Somebody has an idea, comes to a practice and they work on it together. “I never finish songs by myself,” says Frank. “I always half finish them and then the whole band works on it.”,Photon frequently performs in Bushwick. You can see them playing at Party Expo, in Little Skips or catch a glimpse of random members rocking at an open mic. It needs to be said that if Photon performs outside of the neighborhood, Bushwick people migrate like birds to Africa all over Brooklyn, even to Greenpoint…;-),Photon sounds like a bike ride underneath the above the ground subway and like the pure joy of living in Brooklyn. That’s where they get their inspiration: simple earthly Brooklyn pleasures, friends, bikes and roof top parties. You can taste Gilian’s songwriting influence when they sing about the absurdity and pain of love. It’s not an exceptional day when the entire Party Expo is shaking because the audience is singing the name of Frank’s girlfriend (yes, that’s one of their songs).,The Dynamo gang is just recording their second album. To download their first album , for free, just click ,.,
Gillian has been truly inspired lately and her distinctive songwriter’s voice called for a separate project.  The band is concurrently working on “Gillian and the Shiny Pieces” album, which should definitely not escape your attention.

People,"I mean… This is pretty simple. Without certain particular things and people life in Bushwick wouldn’t be as colorful, as entertaining and as …. Bushwicky as it is now. And thank god for them! You know, Evergreen Avenue wouldn’t be so much fun if you didn’t have a bike and couldn’t ride it down happy as a kid. Bushwick wouldn’t be as beautiful without a sudden slot between two warehouses that offers amazing sight of the Manhattan skyline that surprises you again and again on Cypress. Most certainly you grew fonder of Bushwick because of the rain deer graffiti on Troutman. And if Frank Rathbone, a musician, a guitar player and a frontman of a cult Bushwick band Photon Dynamo and the Shiny Pieces moved away from Bushwick tomorrow, the entire neighborhood would have to close down. For sure!,Frank gives you a high five or a funky hand shake whenever you meet him. Frank buys you a brownie when you keep forgetting to eat. Entire Bushwick migrates to different parts of Brooklyn whenever Photon plays outside of the neighborhood. Frank hosts an open mic and encourages all other musicians to come and play. Frank simply is and you want to be his friend.

Arts and Culture,"I’m sitting on a bench on Bogard Street, sipping my latte and observing crowds emerging from the Morgan subway stop melting into Bushwick. It’s a perfect autumn Sunday, you couldn’t possibly ask for a better weather. The air is crystal clear and the sky is ridiculously wide and blue. Bushwick is vibrant today. People have been carrying obscure objects, preparing, assembling, attaching blue posters since the morning. The art festival Beta Spaces 2010 is about to start.,Under the lead of a volunteer organization ,, the visual artists have opened their studios, apartments, lofts and galleries to the public. There are 50 locations and more than 400 individual artists participating. Ali Ashman, the lead organizer, curator and an artist explains that Beta Spaces is a self-organized festival where all the participants are responsible for their show. Despite the large number of participating artists, there are recurring motives, common themes and ideas, such as a notion of home, recycled or found materials and visitor involvement. Frequently, visitors get to participate in the show and become part of the art creation. You can have brunch at Marni Kotas’ house or you can have your broken piece of art fixed by Jefferson Orgy Body. You can play a GPS scavenger game or observe virtual objects alongside reality using a smartphone application.,Bushwick is bursting with creativity and you cannot remain uninspired when exploring warehouse labyrinths, talking with artists and curators. The festival manifests how massively rich the art scene is in Bushwick and how incredibly unique is this neighborhood with such a large concentration of visual artists per square feet. But art creation is not the only motive of the festival, Beta Spaces provides a platform for a dialogue on the role and impact of the artists in the neighborhood, the neighborhood changes and gentrification.,

People,"I start laughing out loud on a late night L train. A bunch of drunk people, currently not listening to their iPods with loud punk music, turn around curiously, frowning their noses with a question in their looks  “Who’s laughing? Why laughter all of sudden?” Raising my eyes from the book, I look at them in appeasement, my look saying: “There’s nothing to be seen here, people, go back to your drunkenness. I am just finishing one but last short story from The Silk City Series by Eric Nelson.”  They seem to have understood, nodding and moaning with boredom, they give me a look back saying: “Ah, right, just a book. We thought, maybe some action…” But I am not listening to their looks anymore because I’m reading again.,I’m in the Silk City, Paterson, NJ where a writer Eric has taken me. I’m standing on the sidewalks while a nervous mom walks by me with her 15-year old son, both in Sunday-church level of attire, headed to ask for money from her father she hasn’t spoken to in years. And I’m observing Italians hugging each other after a huge fight over a broken air conditioner because they’ve been ripped off. I’m in a hospital observing Uncle Punk hallucinating about Gowanus on his death bed…,Eric started to write these stories after his mother died. He went back, collected, recalled, dusted the memories of his childhood neighbors, his mom, the poverty, the families struggling, trying to stick together, fighting and finding each other again… All in a dreary environment of a working class of Paterson.,Having the pure punk in his heart, he started to publish the stories as what was to become an acclaimed zine series.  Shortly the zines came to the attention of a publishing house and became a ,. Neat. So… how did a boy with a blue collar New Jersey background without an MFA degree or any special connections publish a book again? Oh, right, he writes like a punk.

People,"It’s a mid-July afternoon at Bushwick’s Myrtle Avenue. The above-the-ground J and M trains are racing each other in production of industrial noise and delivery and/or removal of the peoples of Bushwick. A , truck in the nearby shade has just reached this season’s top level of sale of Colombian chicken. People are walking, bumping into each other, buying fruit flavored ice cones, cheap jeans and used electronics, their talk is melting into a chant… A hipster chick on a bike wearing shorts causes a small revolution among the topless bodega guys playing domino in the shade. A large white SUV, windows down, just stopped at the red light, proudly provides its addition to the general summer sticky craziness on Myrtle Avenue and it feels like entire Bushwick just started to vibrate in the rhythm of latin pop.  The lights  turn green, the engine roars, driving god knows where, uncovering a young Parisian photographer Axel, who just for a second, overpowered by the heat on a camping chair, closes his eyes behind his trendy Raybans; Canon 5D Mark II left rested on his lap. His hip assistant Ryan is just talking to an old guy who lives 2 blocks away on Broadway. Axel took a photograph of the guy only a couple of minutes ago.,Axel has been making portraits of the Bushwick people on a white background for a couple of days now. White background isolates each single portrayed model from the summer intensity of Myrtle Avenue. Suddenly, every single feature, every single thought, feeling and a unique story of each person portrayed by Axel talks to you from a photo in its quiet, but intense presence.,Axel shakes hands with the old guy who then melts back into the Bushwick everydayness like he just hasn’t been placed on a stage alone to tell his story and tell it over and over forever on Axel’s photograph.,Axel is a French photographer who came to New York years ago to pursue what he is best at – portrait photography and to enjoy the bitter-sweet life of a freelancer. Soon he discovered Bushwick, which became his home, inspiration, very own private third world and a melting pot bursting with creative energy. In July, he had a simple idea to portrait Bushwick in its ugly beauty, which soon led to a bigger project than one would imagine. Axel is currently preparing a photo-exhibit and a book to be published.,Stay tuned to Bushwick Daily for more about the development of this extraordinary project.",,"Axel Dupeux,Brooklyn,Bushwick,Bushwick Daily,Bushwick portraits,Featured,photography,portrait photographer","

At that moment, the only possible shush answer to the worn out, tired, dusty and whiny me was an immediate increase of caffeine in my blood. A cute little corner coffee shop came in handy. Cozy, art on the walls, great music, macbook crowd, amazing coffee and a petit smiling girl behind the counter…,Approximately 20,000 coffees later, I knew Linda Thach and the story of how she created Little Skips; a café, which can’t even be called the second home of the most young people living in Bushwick, because it’s their first home, it’s virtually their living room.,Linda is a cute little spirit, and the original little skipper, with roots in Cambodia, she can’t fight something eternally positive about her personality, even when she’s tripping from fatigue. But don’t get confused by the little girl look, being very down to earth, together with Henry Gluckroft, Linda manages her own business at a very young age and is a friendly boss to a handful of employees.,Little Skips is certainly one of the reasons why Bushwick, as we know it, is expanding from the L train towards Myrtle Avenue. Furthermore, it’s a place where the local community meets and works together. It’s a very unifying Bushwick spot where ideas are discusses and are brought to life.","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

People,"Take a sip of a strong aromatic drink, recipe of which is one of the many secrets of Jackie Summers. Close your eyes and let your brain slowly recognize layers of cinnamon, clove and cardamom. Feel the gentle late summer breeze on your face and comfort yourself in a large red garden chair on the roof terrace of the Bushwick apartment of the writer Jackie Summers. You are about to hear a story. A true story. A story about how nothing compares to happiness and about how nothing hurts more than the pain only love can bring…,It was about a year ago when a director of production in a popular woman’s magazine, Jackie, decided to give his stories a more tangible form and start a blog. He wanted to tell stories about how the real New Yorkers live and love.  Forget Carrie Bradshaw, forget the glamour, turn off the TV show about New York that was made in Hollywood and cross the Williamsburg Bridge. Listen to the slam of the door in a Brooklyn apartment, listen to the long orgasm moan, watch a couple hold their hands….,After a brief chitchat with death, Jackie decided to leave behind a job that wasn’t making him happy and to focus only on what is really important – to live well and to listen to his call. Currently, is this Bushwick-based New Yorker having long conversations about love with his friends and is writing a book based on his popular blog, ,., ","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.

In the Hood,"Hipster; when I look it up in the dictionary: hip-ster: a person, esp. during the 1950s, characterized by a particularly strong sense of alienation from most established social activities and relationships. Now a couple of days I spent in Brooklyn, brunching, partying among the hipsters did give me the strong sense of alienation…about everywhere else I had been…except Brooklyn.,Spending time with the hipsters boosts your artistic talent. In Brooklyn, art is in the air and you grasp it with every breath. Now don’t get me wrong about Brooklyn art. This is not the noble art white people have imposed on us; the fancy French label for culture. Dead masterpieces locked up in museum confinement, rotting on shelves, decaying on walls. Brooklyn art is alive; an ,art yet with every touch of sophistication. When you set off on your scavenger hunt looking for it, you need to have the eye to spot it. A tattoo here, piercing there, an outfit, a flashing light, an exhibition in a being held out in a factory, an amazing dance being performed on the street, a graffiti masterpiece, an unwritten story being told by a writer in a Bushwick apartment or a small concert at a local club…hipsters were performing everywhere.,the word itself sounds very artistic, yeah, hipster sounds very hip; modern. Hip-ster; the hip part make it sound sexy and could very well work for a jeans brand. I picture it on a billboard like the one for Levi’s I saw today over at Times square with a picture of three juicy booties and quoting: “All asses were not created equal” hell no! Hipsters are very different, as if pertaining to the same tribe, you can spot them, you can categorize them yet there is no conformity. It’s neither the tattoos not the piercings. There’s something about the peculiar hairstyles, the bird nests, the extremist-looking beards or the 1980 porn star moustache, but it’s not that. The clothes, the styles will definitely draw your attention. Some stylish, others seem to have walked into the thrift shop around the corner and randomly picked a $50 outfit, but I guess style is a matter of taste…and taste had no borders in Brooklyn…and unlike Paris, Rome or Milano, here, you could break all the fashion rules without getting arrested. The only one thing possibly identifying the hipsters was the spirit; the creative artistic, rebellious spirit. Modern day hippies, bohemians who settled in Brooklyn (when I asked my ex girlfriend if they had hipsters in Queens, she said no)…most of them will never make it, but they all dream the same…they all strive for success.,Ever since reading Elizabeth Gilbert’s Eat, Pray, Love and her story about how she finds a word for each city – that word would be in the head of every person in that city and if you wanted to fit in then you had to have that word carved in the back of your mind as well – ever since then I find myself thinking of ,You see I live in Prague, a nice, small, cozy city in Europe, rich in history, culture, and architecture…modern, medieval and ancient. Prague, a gorgeous city where the women are pretty and the beer is cheap…thus making it a perfect place for ,. I would definitely choose pleasure for Prague and would put that ahead of ,, , or ,It is definitely fun, if you’re only here for a while, but after some time, pleasure stops being fun, yet it’s still pleasing, and you still find yourself doing it. Pleasure in Prague simply becomes a routine. Some find it in sex in a puritan city where everyone is so liberal, others simply find their pleasure in drinking beer and crawling pubs…here it’s just pleasure, no game, no foreplay.,In New York City the world is definitely ,And this was a tough one to figure out. And I’m not sure if this is because the city is so diverse, or if because I was trying to find one word for Manhattan and the boroughs. In Washington D.C. the task was much simpler. The word for D.C. is ,The fat politicians in their black suits decorated with U.S. flag pins, soldiers in their uniforms decorated with medals, foreign diplomats…they were all leading. Even those serving leaders, were second hand leaders and were therefore leading. D.C. was all about leadership. Twelve year old students were shipped to D.C. to attend leadership seminars.,Success is the word I would use for New York City. Everybody I see here is celebrating success and the city is humming. Everyone is successful in New York City. If you’re a white collar working long hours in one of the upper floors, above the clouds, congratulations, you are successful, you made it. If you’re a businessman here in a city humming with opportunity and killing competition, congratulations, you’re successful. If you’re a scary looking foreign cab driver in Manhattan, congratulations for managing third world driving in a first world city, you’re successful. If you’re an illegal immigrant behind one of Manhattan’s many Deli kitchen sinks working from dusk to dawn, congratulations to you too buddy for hooking up a job, you are successful. If you’re unemployed in this city, looking for a job, you’ve made it here, you are successful. If you’re a pedestrian equally crossing on red and white lights and are still alive, congratulations, you are successful. If you’re a tourist here, you’re definitely successful for having made it here, visiting this city is like a pilgrimage, congratulations. If you’re a firefighter here flashing your lights and boosting your sirens so that at least the sound of you gets to the scene on time while you manage to fly over the yellow carpet spread over the avenue lanes, hey, you too are successful. If you are the illegal Egyptian immigrant selling hot dogs of a cart on 5th and 42nd while cranking up Hakeem, you ARE successful. Success here is simply everywhere, and you don’t even have to look for it. It will hit you in the face. Success is on the neon signs and giant LCDs on Time square. It is being played in Broadway shows, celebrated in rooftop house parties and danced to in the clubs. In fact, everybody is so successful, nobody seems to mind the $20 cocktails or the beer being sold at a dollar a letter (PBR – $3, Corona – $6, Heineken – $8…) and therefore even getting drunk becomes a success. In fact the vibe of success is so in the air that they even had to open an army recruitment center right on Times square. Brief, in New York City, the glass is always half full. , Of course this overwhelming vibe of success in it’s concentrated dose has a meditating effect. But coming to New York you contemplate and reflect upon your life. This could have two possible impacts one you. The overdose of success will discourage and depress you. The overwhelming atmosphere of success in the city will demeanor you, belittle you and reduce you to nothing. You will feel so insignificant in NYC that you will hate it. Of course you never liked driving on the fast lane and would rather just cruise steadily down your life…hell no, NYC is just a crazy madhouse where everyone is just running around like a chicken without a head. You feel like a total loser and all you want to do is jump of the Brooklyn bridge and take a nice cold dive into the east river or if Brooklyn bridge is not your favorite cup of coffee, maybe the Manhattan bridge or any of the many bridges or even subway stations in the city…again there’s endless opportunity.,Another possible impact is that you try to point out the success in your life. In this case NYC becomes a wholly trip and every step you take down Broadway and up 5th Avenue inspires you. You lay down on the grass at Brooklyn Bridge park, find inspiration in Central park or simply look for success in the vast horizon off the Empire state building…briefly…an empire state of mind.,Now whether you arrive to NYC, whether by boat, car, train, bus or subway, as soon as you pop out on the street it is as if you got handed a pair of 3D glasses you get at the movies and put them on. All of a sudden you’re aware of a 3rd dimension. Yet apart from the overwhelming skyscrapers, or the breathtaking concrete jungle built to be proportional with King Kong, there’s another dimension to the city. This fourth dimension is the exact opposite of what you would feel if you would visit Venice. For those of you who have experienced Venice, you might have noticed that time seems to have stopped for this town. Venice seems to be living in a totally different time zone, where the clock has stopped ticking.,NYC is on a light speed time axis, where time shrinks and all you do is keep trying to race it. In NYC, everyone is in a hurry, rush hour or not. Fast food places don’t even seem to have seats for lunch breaks and nobody waits for the white pedestrian lights. In NYC even the tourists are in a hurry…so if want to zap through your life, come spend it in this city.,Now I can’t count the times I’ve been to New York City. But I’m starting to realize that visiting NYC is just like having sex; good sex. The pleasure is indescribable, the details are volatile, but the experience is thrilling. Spending time in New York City is just like satisfying an instinct, eating after long hours of hunger or quenching thirst. The aftertaste is impressing. Every time you have it makes you look forward to the next time.,But my favorite in New York City is the Brooklyn Bridge, for no particular reason. I’ve tried to observe this bridge, just to understand why. Comparing it to the other bridges, there’s nothing particularly gorgeous about its architecture neither its location. For some reason I could live and die on this bridge, make love on it and sleep underneath it. After all, it is a bridge to the hipster world…","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily. She can easily be moved by reflection of the sky in a puddle.

In the Hood,"Dear Bushwick fellows, by writing this article, I  feel like I am destroying a hidden oasis, not known to the civilized world yet and very soon tons of cool-clothes-thirsty people will destroy the fragile equilibrium and the magic of the place. But to remain silent isn’t an option either….,There is a tiny vintage clothing store on Central Avenue and it belongs to one of my greatest and favorite exploration achievements in the neighborhood so far.,Just a couple of minutes off the L train Morgan stop, on the  corner of Flushing Avenue, almost invisible to the untrained eye, there is undoubtedly the awesomest vintage clothing store I have seen so far in Brooklyn. In what used to be a garage, Sue, a Bangkok-born Bushwick resident for over 30 years now, sells the cutest dresses, tops, shoes and accessories.,Sue has a surprising sense of fashion and style. An old charismatic lady listens to Diana Krall while stitching together her own old dress she bought years ago in Thailand and a jeans skirt from Urban Jungle. She is interested purely in female fashion and every piece she sells is individually selected by her and altered if she thinks it’s necessary.,If she likes you, she will take you to the back room and you will see endless hangers of lovely pieces by Valentino, Banana Republic, Club Monaco, Pinkyotto or Prada. Nothing costs more that $15, but it might happen that she will refuse to sell you the cutest dress ever, because she wants to copy the cut and make more dresses like that. Pity.,Sue refuses to go big, although she has enough clothes to do so. She opened the store because she loves fashion and because she has a soft spot for local kids, as she says. She likes to help them to look great for little money, because she knows they are just starting in life and don’t have Wall Street jobs.,Sue is a great story teller. It’s worth to just pop by her store to hear how the neighborhood looked like 30 years ago when she was scared to walk on the streets after dark and strongly preferred Manhattan. But during the past year, she saw more and more young people walking around Central Avenue and thought it would be a good idea to open a store. It was an awesome idea, indeed!,The store doesn’t have a name yet and if it’s closed you could never tell it from a regular garage, but if you’re lucky and if you walk with your eyes open, you’ll get to meet Sue and her amazing clothes.","Combination of a writer+photographer, and the founding editor of Bushwick Daily.
