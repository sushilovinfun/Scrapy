"Last weekend, we discovered a brand new band, quintet ,. Stone Cold Fox has a young American indie rock sound that’s more than about just partying. Lyrically, every song was crafted beautifully, showing their mature songwriting capabilities. Their set was vibrant, young, nostalgic and reminiscent of the perfect summer NYC night. To my surprise, this Bushwick Music Crush put some much-needed spring fever into my heart.  ,We are over the moon here at , because last night we won a third place Ippies Journalism Award for the best photograph!, ,Eclectic musician, performance artist and - yes, you got that right - a contributor to Bushwick Daily, , has just released a single , largely inspired by the Bushwick soundscape. You can hear sirens, a police radio, and factories in the track that was recorded with a boom mic from her window at Knickerbocker Ave. “I recorded this with a lot of Bushwick in my soul,” Ana said. The lyrics are taken from Pablo Neruda’s quotes.,Ana Lola Roman, originally from a small town in Oklahoma, has Spanish roots, and has also lived in Berlin. She is currently working on her debut album ,, which will be released in June 2013., ,Ever heard of Eve Ensler’s play, ,? For those who love the script, missed out on the pop culture phenom, or any of you curious about the inner workings of a woman’s brain, fret not! Bushwick is getting its own dose of pussy power! Led by ,, the, will be presented at , from April 5-7, 2013 and features a cast comprised of seasoned and rookie actresses who interpret the scripts as each woman would - differently., ,Sometimes by the time the end of the week rolls around, you want to get it. Grab it, make it yours. Enjoy it, savor it, do it right. Whether you’re thinking of the ass of your crush OR that satisfactory Friday night show you’ve been waiting for, go forth with Bushwick Daily’s blessing, the hymn-like statement, “Get it Guuurl.” Here are the top 9 shows this weekend in Bushwick and beyond - we’ve got FREE parties, some DIY concerts, a festival, late night DJ sets and more., ,I desperately want to say yes to this question, but I really don’t think it’s true for a lot of women. I admire women who are capable of sleeping with someone for the hell of it, but I don’t think it happens as often as the ladies let on. It’s just not cool to say you want to have a relationship with the person you’ve had sex with. If you go there, people will think you’re weak and needy. Ugh!, ,Sunday night 19 artists converged in , to compete against one another in a Bob Ross landscape painting takedown.  You may be familiar with the popular , competitions that pit amateur cooks against one another in an attempt to win audience votes and street cred. In the 10 years since its inception, the Takedowns have morphed to include a variety of foods from avocados to cookies! This, however, was the first Takedown that wasn’t culinary, and what better place to host a paint-off than in Bushwick? The Active Space was set up with 19 easels facing the front of the room where repeat episodes of Bob Ross were projected on a screen. Each artist had 1 hour to create their version of a Bob Ross landscape for the chance to win the audience vote and $250 worth of art supplies from Utrecht. That’s a prize worth fighting for., ,Rain gently pattered on the back window of , library and reading room as the L train roared beneath Bogart Street during a Secret Reading on a Tuesday afternoon a couple of weeks ago. Spectators nestled on couches, the floor and anywhere they could fit inside the intimate space and listened intently to author Cameron Pierce, of Portland’s ,, read from his book ,.,There are now more books on the walls, more makeshift shelves, more events planned and more bodies reading books on the couches on any given day. In fact, Tonight, Wednesday, March 27,  at 7 p.m. Mellow Pages will host a reading by , and ,own ,, where she will read from her new novel ,. This is life now for Jacob Perkins and Matt Nelson, the creators of the independent library, which ,. ,Last week we told you the ways ,‘. In our comments section, readers ended up showing some love for its parallel sister train, the J! Though it has a bad rap, the J/M/Z  train line is actually pretty dope- it runs frequently, rarely has back-ups and delays like the L and it spans a lot of territory. While the L train has its selling points, here are quite a few ways the J train totally trumps the L., ","

"This morning , Bushwick’s Community Board 4 has decided that going forward, all liquor licenses in the neighborhood will be subject to a 12 a.m. curfew on Sunday nights. That means after midnight on Sundays, the drinks will stop being poured. But how will we be able to start the week off right without our weekly Sunday evening drinking contest at Tandem?? Read on for the ruling., ,The latest artist to land on our radar is the female rapper going by the name ,. We’re all for educated, witty females poking fun and attacking the heavily male dominated music industry. Girls just want to have fun and this 24 year old woman repping Queens knows just how to play. Her latest single, “My Vag” is a smart and catchy parody of that macho tune we all reluctantly had stuck in our heads a while back- ,‘s “,“. “It’s a celebration of women,” Awkwafina said. “There aren’t a lot of songs out there talking about vaginas in an in-your-face kind of way.”, ,s ,, there was Williamsburg/Bushwick-based web series ,from creator ,.  The series hilariously captures the exasperation of being a single and lonely hipster in New York, as well as the struggles of financially surviving as a freelancer – all within five-minute webisodes. The show has been compared to the likes of ,, ,, ,, ,, and of course, the inevitable referral to ,. Unlike ,, however, , is from a low-budget show from a man’s point of view, more like two dudes gathering laundry and complaining about how dirty the subway is.,Season one, which first aired in January last year, begins with the end of Rob’s relationship, where he is shoved into the depths of the big New York singles sea. This quote, from the protagonist, sums up the sappy view this sensitive guy has on true love:,“I hate parties. I don’t want to do that. I want to go home, stay at home,” Rob sulks to a friend in episode one. “The other day, together, we baked two pumpkin pies and ate both of them in two days – that’s love.”,We sat down with Hugel himself for an exclusive Q+A., ,It’s finally upon us: the week we’ve been anticipating. We’ve been itching to wear our best socks and then rock them right off. That’s right, Bushwick Daily will be grooving at ,‘s excellent Friday Night showcase at ,. The show features bands so special they could constitute Bushwick Music Royalty-, , ,, and ,. All comfortably wear a rock’n'roll nametag, but Beach Arabs (,) feature tropical guitar solos, Air Waves bring to the table gentle and earnest songwriting, and with headliner The Beets nostalgic garage feel, you’ve got a lot of rock variety to get familiar with. Plus, the show takes place in one of the coolest DIY venues around, ,. Living Bread Deli, which is a fully functional deli during daytime hours, is known for hosting some of Bushwick’s best indie bands. And, it’s all ages, so if your little sister is in town, no excuses to leave her home.  Don’t be a pussy! Listen to the melodic pop rock of Darlings below and tell us you don’t want to sway back and forth, juice in hand, to this band! Come out and condition those ears to some damn good music! ,.,Bushwick Art & Shipping Inc. just moved into town. Sure, there are already a few stores that sell art supplies in the neighborhood, such as , on Gardner (which operates only during short weekday hours), , at the Loom , and ,on Central. But this addition to the wide array of small businesses popping up in the ‘hood is one that was sorely needed. Bushwick Art & Shipping Inc. brings together all of the art supplies that previously were spread out, scarce, or just plain inaccessible all under one roof. With a very convenient location (on Flushing, just steps from the Morgan L stop), this diverse store houses art supplies, a shipping center which is FedEx, USPS, and Postal Service certified, and a vintage boutique, making it a one-stop-shop for many locals. (Fun fact: well-known gallery , was here before closing in 2012.), ,This Saturday’s birth in the art world of Bushwick came by the name of Transfer Gallery opening Alexandra Gorczynski’s debut solo show. The show called Truisms reflects Alexandra’s reflections on the baby making that is happening today between art and technology. Her work brings the two worlds together by applying the raw sensibility of the physical world into the photoshopped digital world. With every piece of work we witnessed this juxtaposition, the same way we witness our dual selves every day we switch back and forth from Facebook to real life. ,Dancers are accustomed to rehearsing and performing in all sorts of spaces: bars, attics, basements, kitchens. They are adaptable creatures, quick to size up their temporary practice lair and visualize ways to move within, or not. But when I think of rehearsal spaces for dancers in Bushwick, I , think ,, because , is here. You might have heard of it- The $8 an hour (or less) rental space just a quick walk from the Morgan L stop at 304 Boerum Street. Amidst the concrete jungle, Chez Bushwick is a reliable and cheap space where creators can create and dancers can jump without having to ask “how high?”, ,The next time you visit the studio building at ,, let your wanderings take you as far back on the first floor as you can go. If you go down the hallway that leads to , make a sharp left and make your way to the back of the building. Keep going, because you are on the right track to ,. If this gallery is not on your cultural radar yet, it’s time you took notice! Your journey will be rewarded as it will lead you to the wonderful solo exhibition of , and his bright and colorful, almost monstrous creations. The show is a collection of larger than life fabric constructions that seem to actually leap off their walls and defy their very two-dimensionality. I had the good fortune to experience the lively and unique exhibition during its opening, which coincided with Bushwick Armory Night. As one of a number of other participating galleries in the Bogart building alone, Tim Zercie’s , was a standout exhibition for a night abounding with competition. ,WAXworks, a strand of the ,, will host a showcase for emerging choreographers at , this Sunday, March 24th. WAX currently does not have a permanent home, but the show must go on! ","

Look no further than , presented by Matt Timms. 20 artists will take over , (566 Johnson Ave) from 6 to 9PM, in a competition to create the best Bob Ross landscape painting! ,Aaaaah, the L train. Why do we love it? Well, the answers are obvious! Everyone wants access to easy train transfers, and Union Square is on the line. If you’re like everyone else who lives in Brooklyn and into food and bars, there are a plethora of sweet places to fill up near most every L stop. It’s basically a fashion show, with outfits and makeup worthy of a half-baked red train carpet. It’s also a way to get where you’re going and take in some serious eye candy at the same time. But holdup! The L train isn’t all wine n’ roses either. Ever heard of , ? Let’s all commiserate for a hot second on how trifling this train can be. Damn you, L!,Have you heard of ,? Of course you have! It’s the neighborhood’s newest, stylish space complete with huge windows, a projector playing scenes from silent movies, and quaint antique decor. Some might even say it’s the Cat’s Meow. Luckily, the management and hostess Merry Cherrie have noticed the buzz and have begun a new, monthly queerparty named just that. ,Who wouldn’t love good ol’ printed literary journals that give a dose of nostalgia, and make you want to thumb thorough their pages and inhale the smell of the paper. We just got our hands on the debut issue of beautiful biannual ,, created in Brooklyn (largely in Bushwick). Issue #1 featured poetry by Eileen Myles, fiction by Jacob Mercer and visual art by Brett Rees, among others.

Alicia Torres from Ridgewood Bushwick Senior Citizens Council is the mother to a brilliant idea: To organize a collection of prom outfits for boys and girls from local high schools. “Some kids don’t go to prom because their parents can’t afford to buy them a prom dress,” Alicia told us.

We went to another body painting party at ,; this shindig was called “Abstract” and was hosted by ,, who put on a lot of shows around the area and in Manhattan. What greeted us was a warehouse full of gyrating glow-in-the-dark body parts and bumping house music that pulsed your organs worse than a Motorhead concert.

When visiting him in September of 2012, he told me about being a kid in the midwest and going to all-night coffee shops.

They’d take the doughnuts to Kinko’s and smear them across the copy machine’s glass to match the speed of the machine’s light.

"Since we “celebrated” Presidents Day last weekend by making a few bad decisions Sunday night and skipping work on Monday, this week’s Drink & Ride takes us to the aptly named Jefferson stop. Luckily, a bunch of new spots have opened up nearby in the past year which means you won’t have to go thirsty for long., ,You’ve barely recovered from the all night wandering between Bushwick art spaces during ,, and now there’s another art-exploding weekend ahead of us! Brace yourself, Bushwick art lovers, because we have some seriously excellent shows coming up on Friday and Saturday. Here is your selection:, , [DNAinfo], [TimeOutNY], or check them out in Bushwick (our guide coming up) [PaperMag], [Brokelyn], [FREEwilliamsburg], [Gothamist],Bushwick has been witness to a huge increase in the number of businesses in the past months - from , to , and pet stores. While this explosion gave Bushwick residents more reasons to hang out locally, it also raised many questions. Who actually owns these businesses, and who are these businesses created for? Do long-term Bushwick residents also get to benefit from the startup heat in the area or is this strictly recent “transplants” matter? We are very glad to inform you that many Bushwick businesses are owned by the Bushwick “natives” and are doing really well. Take Bushwick-raised ,, who have recently opened their second business in the area – , on Wyckoff Ave., , has been keeping a good eye on real estate development in Bushwick. Yesterday they published a map (below) of six ongoing residential development sites, primarily along the JMZ subway lines.

So get your prayers together and go see these lovely four people play some unreleased music!

Entitled ,, this “nite” boasted an artfully and well-curated selection of ten participating galleries between the Jefferson, Dekalb, and Myrtle Avenue stops. According to Beat Nite curator and , co-founder ,, his goal this time around was to be more selective in choosing the participants in order to make the gallery crawl a manageable size for attendees, and to highlight certain newer galleries on the tour in order to build excitement and momentum into these new spaces., , is becoming one of our favorite new hangouts! With their great menu of homey food, great coffee, cheap beers and huge events space, it made the perfect backdrop for our banging , last weekend. So I was very excited to learn that Doug Zambon, of local pop/punk band ,, is organizing a weekly Open Mic Night series for musicians in the roomy back area. If you’re a musician (or even a dreamer), these low-key, judgement-free sessions are a great place to try out a new song or perform an old favorite. Sign up starts at 7:30 pm, and at 8:30 the acoustic Open Mic will start. And like the flier says, “No Mic, No Fear.” See you there!,Ah, Bushwick…A sea of creative ingenuity, fabulous new restaurants and what else? Slumlords!, ,After the 5,000th request to help you find a roommate, job or a space for your next art show, it became really apparent that the Bushwick community needs us to create a Classifieds section. Since we love you, dear readers to death, we pulled up our sleeves over the weekend and created a beta version ,! The response from the community was overwhelmingly positive, which makes us really happy.,We tried to come up with categories that would really suit Bushwick, and so you can now post your ads for roommates, artist studios, jobs, missed connections and more! If you feel like we left out some important category or if you have any other feedback, please let us know in the comments section below.,All the ads can be placed for free so you can go wild finding whatever and whoever you need! The only paid ads are apartment and studio rentals (sublets and roommate requests are still free), because that category will mostly be used by real estate agents and landlords for professional purposes. These paid ads cost $20 per month.,Enjoy!","

"All I know is that on the Super Bowl Sunday ,, and one of them was a great show at , with ,, ,, ,, ,, and ,. The show had a lot of build-up with its indie star-studded bill, featuring members from ,, ,, and more. The venue quickly filled up with friends, fans, musicians and artists alike. It was one of those nights where you felt like you were right at home (if your home smelled like cigarette smoke, beer and sweat). It was kinda like a Super Bowl for new bands. ,Early Tuesday morning a non-union school bus crashed into a car, leaving 14 people injured, including 11 children. The accident took place around 8:10AM at the corner of Myrtle and Wilson. All injuries aboard the school bus were minor, but the driver of the car is in serious but stable condition. The crash ignited tensions about the professionalism of non-union buses, as many school buses have been still on strike for over a month., ,I weaved my way to the entrance, the lower level of a residential apartment building, trying not to step on the massive yellow lab standing sentinel at the front door. I glided past the waistcoated bartender with his melting bowl of ice and lonely bottle of cheap vodka that outlasted its mixers. I waited for him to wash out a few plastic cups that he happily filled with the remaining drudges of white wine and helped myself to a few Hershey’s Hugs that seemed out of place in the setting. Any feeling of pretense or discomfort dissolved as I went deeper into the gallery space and started focusing on the art present at the exhibition opening for ,., ,Here is a formula for how to create and have more of something you desire in 5 easy steps, with a very unusual method for getting it: ritual design. This is a recipe and ritual for how to receive more, and it is a living, breathing, active biology of how to receive more. Yes, my dear, receiving is an action. To receive and to have are not the same as to be passive. Our culture teaches us a lot about how to give, how to take, achieve, do, and accomplish, but not so much about how to receive. Your capacity to receive is your yin, or feminine craft of healing and having, which ideally balances your yang energy form of giving. It’s a law of nature to have both within every living being. I’m going to give you the formula for having more of what you want, like a recipe, with 5 key ingredients:, ,Happy Valentine’s Day, Bushwick! Whether you’re in love or single at the moment, we love you!! And that’s why Bushwick Daily contributors got together and created this super awesome Valentine’s Day playlist! So just sit back, hit play and get ready for a variety of emotions. You’ll be jumping, crying, laughing and cuddling whatever happens to be near you – your loved one, your pet or yourself (nothing wrong with that!). In other words, you will love it! Here is what we chose and why:, ,The , of Total Slacker drummer Terence Connor remains a mystery.

Or at the very least you can win a free dinner while getting set up MTV-Singled-Out-style during my Dr. Lisa’s Match-Up Mash-Up Game!,The Valentine’s Day season is a great time to revisit the age-old discussion of who should do the pursuing. Bear in mind, none of this is personal. But I do think biology weighs in on the side of men pursuing women. As ,of the Man Code put it, albeit quite inelegantly, “More often than not, the feel-good boost he gets by being ‘asked out’ gets squashed within hours by a biological backlash of she-male chemicals.” In other words, the ‘high’ he gets from you asking him out will only last until his internal romance meter realizes that he is now in the ‘feminine’ position (aka: being the chase)…and this kills the attraction.” And here’s some,that suggests that when pursued, women turn down offers of casual sex for one simple reason: they suspect they won’t enjoy it. Of course, biology is not destiny!

"A proper Bushwick art addict doesn’t mind heavy snow and/or gusty winds. , to arrive today at 2PM (heavy snow) and tomorrow at 2PM (gusty winds), so I hope you have your warm shoes ready…because you have 5 amazing art shows to shovel your way to through the snow!, , [Brownstoner], :( [DNAinfo], [Zagat], [Brokelyn], [Paper Magazine], [Bushwick Nation], [Wall Street Journal],Throw Something – but not at a person. Throw an object symbolic of what you wish to release into a field, an ocean, or abyss of your choice. If this makes you concerned about littering, throw the symbolic object into a garbage dumpster or compost pile of choice. The action of throwing something with your body provides your nervous system and your somatic memory with the experience of releasing and propelling “something” away from you. In woo-woo terminology, this cleans your energy of clinging and gripping onto specific results. It clears you and makes you receptive to the best and highest possible outcome, which might be even better than whatever you are trying to force into existence. In quantum science or epigenetic language, you are acting out with your own nervous system what you want so that your mind and body can sync up. Either way, it works. Have you ever turned on a computer or a light without knowing EXACTLY how it works? Designed Rituals work the same way., ,Wandering into , off of a snow-dusted Forrest Street is a moment demanding to be experienced right now. Having grown accustomed to bright lights, white walls and winter doldrums I was initially taken aback by the somber back room of the gallery. Through the doorway, one can see only a fraction of three fantastic floating sculptures created by artist and costume designer ,., ,As if there already weren’t enough reasons to never ever leave this lovely neighborhood of Bushwick, here is one more: , is slowly but surely coming at us with a promise of 3 to 30 inches of snow, aka either a lot or not. In either case, your home neighborhood just became a tiny bit more inviting than usual. And when in Bushwick… Check out 5 fabulous parties this weekend:, ,A new record label has decided to plant their seeds here in our ever so welcoming hood of Bushwick. The DIY label ,features the likes of , and , who are both picking up momentum. DUST in particular who just received the MP3 of the week via , and also received attention in ,., ,This week, performance artist Ann Hirsch takes a stab at helping me understand this phenomenon. Here’s a psychological question that is unresolved for me, so I thought maybe as an advice columnist, it’s time for me to get some opinions from you all. I have seen over and over how my female artists friends who have been in situations, when dating or otherwise, of being judged negatively on a personal level by their work and their willingness for exposing themselves. My personal guess is that men see these women as too aggressive and not feminine (passive?) enough.  Paradoxically, quite often, these are the women that are the most traditional, even conservative in their lifestyles., ,If you want to do something really special for this neighborhood and for its kids, you should absolutely attend , this Saturday, February 9, 2013 from 6-8PM at ,. Still Waters in the Storm is a unique organization run solely by volunteers dedicated to literacy of the local kids. Kids come to Still Waters to read, write, learn and express themselves while feeling safe., ,They say there’s an audience for everything. But perhaps this excludes the scatological renderings of Bushwick resident Jonathan Mittiga. Last year Mittiga read a “repulsive” short story that didn’t go down well with the audience and was told, “You can’t read that stuff here,” by the reading’s organizer and was never invited back to read. “[The story] was about gross things. I didn’t realize at the time that it wasn’t a gross out contest,” Mittiga said. “I was simply writing for an audience of myself.”,Rather than cry, feel like a complete failure, get drunk and swear off writing altogether—as perhaps many of us would’ve done—Mittiga and roommate James Sprang launched the , (BRG) series last October at , in Williamsburg. The reading happens every last Sunday of the month at 8PM to unsuspecting customers and people trying to study (good luck with that)., ","

"Let’s face it, taking the hike to Ikea to purchase home décor made out of plastic can be a drag. If you have always been more inclined towards the wacky or unusual aesthetic, then our discovery of ,, a new antique store on Wilson Avenue in Bushwick, will make you happy! This gem is located inside the home of its owner, Craig Cady, and the store’s contents makes it really worth stopping by!, ,There is nothing wrong with spending half a day shamelessly indulging yourself with art, wandering and experiencing. For this lovely purpose, let me recommend the 56 Bogart building located right across the street from Morgan L train stop. The building is home to numerous artist studios, but mainly to 10 galleries on the ground floor and at the basement level. The high concentration of art at 56 Bogart makes the building a go-to destination when you acutely need large quantities of great art. Here is what to see right now:, ,Do not try to have your art framed at , on 241 Troutman…That is unless you are MoMA, Sotheby’s or if you own a Picasso. Marcello Quebracho is not just any framer. Together with his partners, he created and restored the frames of the most valuable masterpieces of the history. Yes, including Mona Lisa’s frame in Louvre., ,Without a doubt one of the most interesting art shows on view in Bushwick right now is no more. The huge plexi monolith at , cracked. This site-specific installation by Adam Parker Smith had to be abruptly uninstalled one week before the planned ending of the show. “I was at the gallery yesterday to meet a group of students […], when I noticed huge cracks forming on the monolith,” the gallery owner Deborah Brown emailed us. “I could hear the glass starting to crack and the fissures were spreading. It was alarming because the piece is 9′ high, and it was dangerous,” Deborah continued., ,Following the second inauguration of President Obama this week, now is probably as good a time as any to take up the questions of race, class and commerce posed by Kelly Anderson’s piercing documentary, , The film is a sincere, albeit unresolved, attempt to highlight the ways in which connecting to our neighborhoods as consumers can be way more consequential than connecting to them as active members of the community., ,You make an eye contact with the person passing by. You can’t tell if it’s a man or a woman, mostly because of the scarf wrapped around his/her head. You tilt your head a little as if to say, “I feel you, good Bushwickian of unknown gender, I’m freezing too!!” But the good news is that you’re already outside and you probably feel like real social interaction after days of hibernation in your Bushwick apartment. So take the freezing stranger with you and check out these awesome events for this weekend!! Maybe you’ll meet a Bushwick Polar Bear…., ,Everything. When we exercise, we choose what we would like to feel like, and we choose the experience we’d like to have with our body. Take swimming, for example. It gives you a totally different feeling and experience than that from a kickboxing class does. Both are great choices; both give you very different results.,This case study is of a client at Bushwick Pilates combining her exercise and movement with a Custom Designed Ritual. She started by placing an intention into her exercise. Her intention was to get her “yang,” or masculine energy, laser-focused and in service of her “yin,” or feminine energy., ,The neighborhood of Bushwick was shocked by the multiple attacks on women that occurred in ,. “He grabs the women in the dark from behind and slams them against a building wall, covering their mouths so they can’t scream. He has attacked several women on Knickerbocker Ave., on White St, Bushwick Ave, & Moore St (near Roberta’s),” read an email we received, which quickly became viral on Facebook and in the windows of Bushwick establishments. The sad narrative instigated an assumption that we have a serial rapist in Bushwick who needs to be put behind the bars asap. Our readers have constantly asked what is going on., ,It’s that time of the year when everything comes into perspective. Brooklyn is chilly and with temperatures falling into the low teens, once meaningful priorities are easily being kicked off your to-do list. For instance, is that someone or something really worth the , into this frigid tundra we know as Bushwick? Well, these , will be worth the adventure. Grab a hot spiked anything on the walk over and remember to keep it , ,I was really pleased to read James Ryder’s recent article, , James writes: ,As a relatively recent hetero transplant from Chelsea, I was surprised to read this since Chelsea seemed much more sexually segregated. I really enjoy how much the LGBTQ community feels integrated in a particularly healthy way in Bushwick. But James’ article highlighted that there simply aren’t enough places to go for queers to socialize just with each other., ","

"In the last moments of poise before the internet music machine squats down and shits out 2013, I’d like to take a look back at three great artists who came up this past year. I’d venture to say they all produced under-appreciated records, but to be honest I’m nauseated by music journalism so probably I’m unqualified to make statements like that or to write about music at all, but hey, I’m just here playing my trumpet. Let’s finish this up before I puke in my lap.,, everybody. I hope you practiced your , properly, because in Bushwick, perfect French pronunciation is a must these days.

Try our four awesome warm workouts to detox, shape and regenerate your body!, ,In October we profiled Bushwick-based energy healer and consultant , whose mission is to empower artists and others from the neighborhood to find their inner self and align their heart with the work they do. Darcy calls her practice, which she maintains on Hart Street, inner wisdom coaching, and she believes that through transformation of your beliefs you can change your reality and live your dreams.,Darcy is now starting a spiritually-minded Bushwick community that will be meeting regularly. She is hosting the first meeting on February 5th, 7-9PM titled , ,It is not too early to start thinking of June! Especially if you want to make the most out of your , experience as a volunteer, venue or artist. On ,, the organization responsible for BOS, Arts in Bushwick is holding their first public meeting. As you know, Arts in Bushwick is an all-volunteer organization without a hierarchical structure.

"It’a about time that something , opens in our quixotic neighborhood. This new zany bar is brought to us by two Frenchmen, Jean-Stephane Sauvaire and Greg Baubeau. BIZARRE, the name of the new addition to our neighborhood, will open its doors this weekend for the three day long opening party.,I bet some of you old-time New Yorkers are wondering, ,? To answer your question, yes there was.  Bizarre Bushwick pays homage to the , where Andy Warhol discovered Nico and the Velvet Underground in 1965, and where the beat generation held their poetry readings., ,Have you ever noticed how when you try to move past something, that the more you tell yourself to “drop it” and “let it go,” the louder and more demanding that very thing becomes?

One of the parties I’ve heard a lot about is the regular , party at , on 59 Montrose Avenue. The party features artists, shows, androgynous drag performers, and attracts a slew of very interesting characters. Previous parties have featured various colors of the rainbow, a tribute to the diversity of both the performances and the crowd that gathers within The Spectrum. This week, however, was focused on the “Temptation of the Flesh Tones” which brought the costumes and performances into a new realm that left little to the imagination and yet still sparked the creative spirit in everyone present., ,I’ve driven hundreds of miles with my brothers, father and best friend in search of Cuban Sandwiches that are more than just passable.

The fluorescent humanity of her 1984 homage to Edward Hopper (see above) merged with the subtle sweetness of fried plantains at ,over by the Myrtle-Wyckoff station.,Meryl, 61, reminisced over lunch about how her job as an art teacher at Bushwick’s IS-291 helped her capture the arresting images of resilience amid rough circumstances for which she is known.,“Looking back, I’m very conscious of the fact that I was doing positive reinforcement,” she said. “I was photographing things I found uplifting.”, ,I love you, Bushwick, but I have some complaints. This neighborhood, so creative, friendly, so densely populated and diverse, desperately , ,., ,Inspired by the Spanish bar culture, Ben Warren and Gina Leone who own ,, have spawned another bar called ,.  The name Heavy Woods is a play on the Dutch word, ,, which later was Anglicized to Bushwick. The new space serves a full bar, unlike its older sister, and as of December 2012, began to serve Chef Simon Glenn’s d.b.a popular pop-up, New Orleans style BBQ, Tchoup Shop. The food will be served from Wednesday through Sunday with expectations that it will be nightly in 2013., ,The first class of Bushwick-trained yoga teachers walked happily out of , studio only a couple of weeks ago. The fresh yoga teachers were raving about their 6 months of training, their teacher Ella Luckett and how it changed their lives so much. We had to look at Jai Yoga Arts in Bushwick a little closer., ,
Everyone likes to think they know how to party. Especially on New Year’s Eve. You still hurting? Just getting out of the slammer cause your mom posted bail? Then you are not a CHAMPION like myself. You need to leave NYE to the amateurs and wait till this weekend to really pull a bender. Here are my top 5 bands to rectify your situation, my fellow ‘Wicks., ,
A glance at , made me scream a little, and when I took a closer look I was screaming for sure. Apologies to my cats and neighbors but this weekend will be EPIC! With Art Basel Miami and Holidays in December, we haven’t seen too many art openings lately. Well, cry no more! Friday will be a big night for art, so have an extra cup of coffee before you go out! After you’re done with all the openings, we suggest some dancing to keep you warm! And not just any dancing, but some proper Bushwick wilderness… Are you ready? Let’s go!, ,There is no designated stage area, blurring the line between audience and performer, and seating is sparse, as participating in the performance is encouraged. The unknown terrifies you, and yet something, maybe this very feeling, pushes you inside. Welcome to ,.,I consider myself to have a fairly open and high tolerance for the unimaginable, the uncomfortable, the unexplainable, and the bizarre art movements that make this city so unique. That being said, my experience at Grace Space was like no other., ,Bushwick is the neighborhood of many innovative ideas, hundreds of artists, a ton of new bars and well, of thousands of rats.  The good folks over at , put together an interactive map of NYC using the numbers of rat complaint phone calls to 311. And yes, Bushwick won! With 965 rat sightings Bushwick effortlessly won over neighboring competitors such as Bed-Stuy (626), East Williamsburg (431) and Ridgewood (542). The phone calls were places between 2010 and 2012, and if this was any other neighborhood, I would try to argue that the number of phone calls doesn’t necessarily mean that we have more rats that other neighborhoods. It can easily mean that people just complain more… But as I have experienced walks home down Dekalb Ave on a garbage night… (I would chose to walk on the road and rather be hit by a B38 bus than to walk on a sidewalk…) So I will say only one thing: GET A CAT!  [,],Young, fresh and hot is the art of, gallery. Located at 253 Wilson Avenue (a block from Myrtle), the gallery was , eight months ago by Julian Jimarez. With the intention of promoting creativity and under the seasonal name ,, the gallery began a series of frequently changing art shows and atypical workshops (e.g. make your own dumplings). The idea, which would likely give any branding specialist a heart attack, is to change the name of the gallery with the changing seasons. I mean, wouldn’t you prefer spending your time at Outlet Fine Art, as opposed to Sunset Surf Club when it’s barely 30 degrees outside?, ","

"Good news, Bushwick! We’ve got an Asian fusion restaurant in the neighborhood now, and it’s well worth the distinction of being the first. , owners Christine and Ron Guillen opened , just across the street this past summer, where they’re serving up a lots of Eastern goodies on St. Nicholas., ,2012 was awesome, as we mentioned ,. Looking at the most popular stories of 2012 one has to come to the conclusion that our readers are mostly interested in big Bushwick topics such as the changes to the neighborhood; what it means to be part of a quickly changing neighborhood (and in naked women, , surprisingly…).  Bushwick Daily is primarily focused on arts and culture, however there were certain topics we felt we were obliged to inform about (such as a warning to women about attacks in Bushwick). Our mission and focus continue to be the celebration of good things and remarkable people of this neighborhood. Now let’s read through our most popular posts once again:, ,The end of the year is my favorite time because that’s when we get to take a step back and think about everything that we have done. I personally click on the summaries of Bushwick Daily visitor stats, and take a look at the posts published in 2012. What I see frequently surprises, if not shocks me. Though, I have to note that it’s a very pleasant shock.,The first glance at our stats shows that Bushwick Daily did a quadruple flip back and managed to get 10 out of 10 for the landing as well. At the end of 2012 we are reaching , as we did in the beginning of this year (approximately 15,000 in January 2012 and 60,000 in December 2012). If you’re asking about the difference between 2011 and 2012, we have reached , (approx. 73,000 in 2011 and 390,000 in 2012)., ,NEW YEARS EVE! NEW YEARS EVE! I’d chant it from the Empire State Building if only they wouldn’t handcuff me and take me somewhere not as bright and sparkly.

With Bushwick restaurants open and ready for the Holidays, we’re turning your holiday jeer into a holiday cheer! So just sit back, relax, and sip your boozy egg nog. Here’s a very international list of where to eat in Bushwick this year:, ,Everyone in Bushwick has been doing their part to get into the Holiday Spirit, and Morgantown bar , is no exception. Last week they hosted the first annual ,, an intense competition between Bushwick fiercest Sweater-Wearers. Although I didn’t win (or even make the top 12!), I was glad to be found among a group of warm people, in a cozy bar, wearing snuggly sweaters. The unique variety of found sweaters- from classic Christmas sweaters to some not so traditional- including a fuzzy abomnible snowman sweater and a trout-covered garb was uncanny. Read on for polaroids of all the contestants, the runners up, and our personal favorite…, , , ,It’s a Saturday or Sunday, and you wake up magically devoid of a hangover, having done all your laundry, grocery shopping, and other boring adult things for the week. (Ok, so the beginning of this article is hypothetical. But the rest isn’t!) Suddenly instilled with a desire to discover the best that Williamsburg has to offer, you decide to make a day – and night – of it.,Everyone will have their own opinion, some of them snarky, on what is worth doing if you only have twelve paltry hours to soak up the cultural deliciousness that is Williamsburg. However, I firmly believe everything below is a knock-out, guaranteed fantastic time. Unless you don’t like fun. In which case, I can’t help you. ","

"When we saw that the hip-hop producer and Ninja Tune label mainstay , was going to headline a DJ showcase at , on Saturday night, we felt , to see whether or not would his live performance be underwhelming.  His latest release, ,, as well as the excellent Music Scene from 2010 are ponderous down tempo affairs, seemingly better suited to a quiet solitary walk home from the subway station than to the cavernous and graffiti-inspired chic of the Paper Box performance space., ,Like the man who fell to Earth, Adriano landed in my lap inside the , . Out of nowhere. Up through the social media Rabbit Hole, straight into my DM inbox. The universe was uncanny in its thinking, this year. Upon meeting we both knew that we were embarking the age of innovation and re-awakening within the hybrid of music, technology, and performance. We knew that we both had something to offer and that it’s all happening right here in Bushwick.,And speaking of uncanny, two months after ‘meeting’ on Twitter we began to collaborate and perform together. Four months after we started performing we were both featured in two of the most important publications in Italy, one of them being ,. Today Adriano is responsible for an exhaustive list of gallery shows, music projects, compositions, and is a ,. Adriano is also responsible for what could easily be a breakthrough invention in performance-technology for the year 2012: ,. In simpler terms, it’s Body Instrument able to map the joints of the human body, tracking movements that are translated into musical impulses and sounds. Yeah, that happened in Bushwick. Here’s what’s next:, ,It took us about three days to recover… but we are back. , was very likely the coolest holiday party of all times, and we’re so happy we spent it with you!,On Sunday night, the weather sucked; it was drizzling and the Bushwick warehouse promenade wasn’t exactly inviting. However, Bushwick Daily team was running around Brooklyn Fire Proof like a bee hive, hanging photographs; preparing  the ultra-fabulous photo booth; setting up the bands and sipping whiskey. To warm up!  …And then you guys stared to come, and suddenly the house was full, the strobe lights in the photo booth where bleeping, and everybody was having fun! Bushwick Daily Holiday Party was an excellent example of terrific team work. Pure love was floating in the air, and once the party started there was no end to it. Or wait, we just don’t remember it…., ,Last week, I had the distinct pleasure of being the first of the Bushwick Daily family to try ,, a new French Restaurant that opened at 221 Knickerbocker on the corner of Troutman. The bar & bistro’s golden glow is a gorgeous (although slightly out-of-place) vision on the block, which features bodegas, a massive dollar store, a laundry mat, and the recently renovated ,. Despite its uncanny location, the restaurant is here to stay, with its classic furnishings, romantic atmosphere, friendly staff, and fantastic food. From perfecting French staples like Escargot and Creme Brulee to simply nailing Mac’N'Cheese, Mominette is without a doubt Bushwick’s Best New Restaurant., ,I don’t think “the holidays” are a good time for self-improvement, but it is a great time for crazy fun and forgiveness. Mostly forgiving yourself for whatever 2012 fuckups you’re still thinking about, but forgiving others is good, too. Therefore, this is my last post until after New Years.,I have a great date tip to share with you. It’s free, fun, and a wee bit daring, which makes it more of a bonding experience for a date: Get high and visit Santa! You can really find out a lot about someone when you hear what he or she wants from Santa and the pot will help steer the experience from self-conscious to absurdly hilarious. Plus it’s so unwholesome to be stoned on Santa’s lap!,Above is a video of my experience from a date with a man who is now my husband! The video is from a few years ago. We went to Santa at Macy’s Herald Square. They’re open until 9 p.m. and if you go late, there’s much less waiting and pesky children. I wanted a fancy facial and I didn’t know how to describe it to Santa, but the guy I was with married me anyway.,It looks like the end of days is near and the Mayans have us ,. Naturally, that won’t stop some of us from partying our faces off for as long as we have them. Grab your closest friends and face whatever comes our way over the next few days and December 21, with dancing, drinks and art. Here is what’s happening in Bushwick and beyond as we finish the current ,, at Long Count 13.0.0.0.0., ,For ,, year 2012 will forever be connected with ,, and the 100th anniversary of his birth. A year ago, Bushwick’s premier non-profit for arts joined the world movement to celebrate the life and work of one of the greatest composers and artists of the 20th century. Monthly events dedicated to John Cage speaking a number of artistic languages has been titled ,In creating the series, Norte Maar collaborated with ,, namely with its leading figure, legendary Julie Martin.,Lectures, poetry, ballet, electronic and classical music, Norte Maar has not only ventured across the boarders of the artistic disciplines but also far beyond the boarders of Bushwick. They have introduced a night of Cage at Dumbo Arts Center; at Park Avenue Armory or at National Academy Museum.  Norte Maar has been consistently proving, and the Cage Transmitted series has only confirmed that they have branched out from Bushwick and became a strong voice on the New York art scene, and thus fulfilling the Bushwick ideal – developing a successful home base for arts on an alternative basis outside of the old structures; in a small scale reaching a large audience and importance in New York.,We took a moment to reflect on the Cage Transmitted series as it reaches , with curator Jason Andrew and choreographer Julia Gleich from Norte Maar, as well as with Julie Martin from E.A.T., ,Tired of yet another New Year’s Eve with tentatively boring plans? Attempting to go out on New Years in the best city in the world sadly usually ends up a dissapointment. You’ll spend half your time struggling to even get in the door of a shitty bar overflowing with drunk valley girls or (gasp) trying to elbow your way into the city for an overpriced “party”, then the other half trying to flag a cab home.  Those who really know what’s up on New Years know that the biggest warehouses are in Brooklyn- and thus the best parties! This year, have the time of your life rallying in the New Year in a massive art installation, drink in hand and belly, surrounded by hundreds of future friends and lovers- all within walking distance of Bushwick! Look no further- NYC party organization , has planned ,- “Rebirth.” Read on for a Q+A with the party organizers that’ll have you set for 2013., ,If I said ‘jingles’ last week, I have to say JINGLES this week. The Holiday season arrived in Bushwick in all its power of a million Christmas lights from Family Dollar.  Our top event + things to do selection this week naturally has to belong almost exclusively to the Holiday spirit and spirits. Enjoy responsibly, friends!, ,Neighborhood goddesses and music duo ,are back with a new video for their song “So Destroyed.” Prince Rama showcases a range of sounds, resulting in a uniquely weird vibe- equal parts bollywood glam, lo-fi  pop, and psuedo-religious chanting. Their music is basically a pleasurable dose of psychedelic hypnosis.,Their new video steers away from their usual acid-vision filters and pays tribute to the ones they cherish most- their fans! And their fans are some truly special people with incredibly unique dance moves… from disco headbangers to cat gropers, from taking dancing on the bar to another level to popping’n'locking it wearing a golden onesie. ENJOY!","

Especially not in the light of the ,, and the , gang that got busted today., informed today that police busted a 250-member, highly organized gang that had been terrorizing the streets of Bushwick, and committing serious crimes such as murders, assaults, burglaries etc. The gang known as TBO (,) had been around since 2003, and quickly grew in numbers recruiting gang members from other gangs in Brooklyn., ,On duty as Dr. Lisa, I joined the annual December pilgrimage to visit the , last week. ,, I had a full list of the Bushwickians in Miami that I could follow up with to see if they needed any emotional support from the stresses of showing, selling  and seeing art while trying to fit in some partying.

All photos are by me, unless otherwise noted., ,If there’s one thing I’ve learned while living in Bushwick it’s that the best parties and venues are often found by word of mouth. Saturday night was looking dull until a friend told me about ,, a newly opened, art/party space on Irving Ave completely hidden by pulling a drop-down wall in front of it.,Once we arrived we were given two playing cards and a few instructions. Find three other people at the party to make a full house and we’ll give you a dollar shot, the door guy said. A meet up game combined with a celebratory ending.

"Really Starbucks? 1500 more? I can’t walk 6 blocks without running past 2 of you. You need to stop this. I know we hang in the same neighborhoods and enjoy certain blocks more than others, but I think this is going to be too much. Sure, sometimes I’m stuck in the cold and need to use some WiFi, so I’ll pop in and buy a venti mocha frap (of course with whipped cream! I don’t mess around) and connect… but, please… don’t over-think that. I… well, I figured we could move along amicably as acquaintances… y’know, until the whole “brick-through-your-window” incident blew over as nothing more than a hilarious post-adolescent misguided angsty youth thing! No? Well ok, fine.

Let’s stop getting petty. [HuffPo], ,“I’ve always been fascinated at what it must have been like in the 1970s in Soho and the 1980s in the East Village. However, I’ve never been able to find good photographic documentation of that era,” says our contributing photographer ,. “I now see the opportunity here in Bushwick to document our neighborhood at this particular moment. While it is still an artist’s haven and majority Latino. Before my loft becomes the home of a person who trades credit-default swaps. Before it becomes Williamsburg,” Peter continues to talk about his portrait and landscape of Bushwick.,He has been working on it since 2009 with the goal to once publish a photography book. We are now bringing you a little tasting sample of 12 portraits of artists photographed in their natural habitat, artist studios and space. How do you like them?, ,This weekend, dear friends, will blissfully float in a careless party atmosphere. A vast majority of art people are chillin’ on a beach in Miami, but I have some good news for those of you who remained on guard at the fortress Bushwick. We have really good parties this weekend! And they are starting tonight!, ,Our friends over at , are hosting a benefit show this Satuday for the charity ,.   Dance for Doctors is a non-profit that raises money supplement the salaries of medical doctors in Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, and Malawi- four places that have less doctors than most other places in the world.  The basement venue (which happens to be ,) will provide the dusty background for this rave-themed party.

They returned not long ago from performing at the Festival Circuit and touring all over Europe, perhaps where they got the inspiration for this jangly tune, which features an addictive chanting chorus and teetering guitarline …, , ,For some reason, December is the month for shows. Is is the Christmas Cheer? The consumer spirit? Either way, everyone and their little sister is performing somewhere in Brooklyn this month. Not to worry, we’ve rounded up this weekend’s top 5 Bushwick shows + 1 that’s a stone’s throw away. Oh yeah, and some beauuutiful space pix to encourage you to keep reading. All courtesy of ,., , brought news this morning that an 80,000-square-foot retail and nightlife complex is being planned at 88 Bogart St.,“North Development Corp. acquired the 200-by-400-foot behemoth across the street from the Morgan L train stop in August for $12.15 million, and the developer plans to turn the building, which takes up an entire block, into a sprawling nightlife, retail and artist gallery complex on an otherwise underwhelming stretch in Bushwick,” Observer writes.,Andrew Clemens, a director of leasing at Massey Knakal, the firm selected to exclusively market the space, told Observer that while the project is in the very preliminary, conceptual stage, the idea is to create something like a “grittier Chelsea Market.” An independent movie theater, music venue or museum are expected to be the potential big tenants. There was mention of an Urban Outfitters or Guitar Center. Clemens also said that they are considering studio workspace for artists on the upper floor or maybe a hotel/hostel.,Andrew Clemens said that they plan to cater to the local artsy, hipster crowd as Williamsburg is not considered cool by locals anymore. “Bushwick is cool,” he said.,A mall at Bogart St sounds pretty unimaginable at the moment. The project is in its initial stage; the concepts and ideas are being laid. The change is clearly inevitable, but the question is whether we will see a new kind of cultural entrepreneurship which is considerate to the local rich culture or simple mainstream madness. We believe it’s now up to Bushwick to have its voice heard. What is your opinion?,[,],In December, you can easily find me running around and peeking into every single Holiday market stand, sipping egg nog directly from the box, inhaling the smell of live Christmas trees by the Morgan L stop and dragging my boyfriend under every single mistletoe (“What do you mean that that branch is not a mistletoe? MUAH!”). In other words, I am a holiday sucker. Big time.,If you feel similarly, I am sure that you will more than appreciate the number of holiday markets popping up around our beloved pigeon town. At Bushwick Daily, we counted five of them happening in the upcoming two weeks. Make sure to check them out, take a big sip of the holiday atmosphere and support local vendors by shopping for presents there!, ,As I pointed out last week, sex and partying are important, but to really have a healthy emotional life, working hard and being productive is a key ingredient. As a matter of fact, Hyperallegeric.com ran a story this week on the same theme of being productive in artsy places like Bushwick, titled: ,  I struggle with this shit myself (hello hours spent at Pine Box). Btw: If you’re an artist supporting your art with a day job, the day job counts in the hard work/productivity category. The hard part is motivating for your other job, art making.,Angela Washko, who is an overachiever—has a great social life, makes tons of art and dresses great on no money. I tried to get Angela to share some of her secrets. Angela, who is 26,already has a resume that is way too long to be included here (it has seven categories!). Most recently she served as curator of the ,. Plus, she kicks ass at applying for and getting residences, so she has traveled far and wide without having a lot of cash. Some of the places she’s had a residency:,Finland, Iceland, Philadelphia, and the Flux Factory, New York, NY (she ran the residency program there as well). Plus whenever I see her out, which is fairly often, she is having fun and surrounded by cool people. Oh, I’m sure she has her shit too, but that’s not the point right now., ","

Jen is a classically trained painter who likes to work in small dimension.s Recently, you had a chance to see her work at , gallery on Wilson Ave in Bushwick.

Early December is traditionally dedicated to Art Miami Basel and a number of satellite art fairs. The burgeoning Bushwick art scene will not be left out this year, and many Bushwick artists and galleries are headed to Miami beach. So who is going and who is not going and why? What are the expectations of Bushwickians in Miami? Will Bushwick DIY chic prove itself next to the big art world glamour?, ,We are beyond excited to share Bushwick Daily’s first ever video short- aptly entitled “A Night in Bushwick.” We take you for a Friday Night tour of our industrial, artistic, eclectic and ultimately unique neighborhood of Bushwick, Brooklyn.

The blaze on Irving Ave unfortunately left dozens of Bushwick residents’ homeless Sunday morning. Fire officials think it was an electrical fire that started on the second floor of the building.,Thankfully all of the residents in the six-unit building made it out ok (pets included) but there is still a feeling of hopelessness left with the displaced tenants.,“We’re all homeless. We lost everything, we’re all students and low-income [residents]. This was our livelihood,” one tenant said.,The Red Cross is working with the residents to help them get into a shelter in the mean time. Watch [,] for all the details., ,I got into this band by accident – A happy, lovely accident. I was searching for new music and these 3 lovelies reached out.  I love Bushwick’s ,. I love them because they have no ego- they don’t care about how their hair looks or who is in the audience. They are in your face at shows. They get out in the crowd. They are knocking down their gear, bleeding, they are in their own mosh pit. They are honing in on their sound and their look, because they have successfully nailed their vibe.,Before Hurricane Sandy, I caught up with Andy of the group for a quick chat. I am really interested in this band and can’t wait to see how they progress in the studio when they lay down more tracks this year. So not to deter from the tragedy, I am releasing it now. Hold your hats….,Welcome to the third installment of ,. So far we’ve brought you neighborhood recommendations for , - great restaurants and bars serving everything from comfort food, to Vietnamese pho, to classic cocktails; , - visit museums, take classes, and even go kayaking for free; and now we’re turning on sights on where to live in this beautiful area.While LIC is a ‘neighborhood,’ it’s actually comprised of a bunch of smaller neighborhoods, including Hunters Point, Queens Plaza, Court Square, and Dutch Kills., , ,Hey My Music Ragers! Hope everyone survived Thanksgiving with their families, friends or that devious talking fridge that begs to fill up your stomach. Either way, what better way to unwind and shed the haunted leftover T-G weight by dancing at a couple of live music shows in the hood this week?

"Bushwick, embrace yourself for jingles, Christmas trees, carols and awesomely tacky lights that every proper Bushwick house hold should have installed by now!

No joke…, ,As we get older the toy objects we crave change, but the desire for the toys remain strong.

By far the most successful Bushwick restaurant whose bread was proclaimed to be the best in New York by NY Magazine reveals that the candidate should have a culinary degree and/or one year of equivalent experience. He or she must be “focused, hard-working and possess a sense of urgency.”,What can I say? The cut-throat world of artisanal pastry baking unveiled itself right in front of my eyes… You gotta be no. 1 to bake no. 1 bread in New York! (and I am ironic only a little bit).

I just want to remind people how important working hard is for the soul, particularly if you have a creative pursuit and also need to make a living. Hard work is the best way to make yourself feel better and have balance in your life. It also takes a lot more grit and self-discipline than sex or eating. If you look closely at the top of Powhida’s piece, it says “move to Bushwick,” so you’re already off to a good start. Don’t waste it!

"Anthropology students Sidsel Filipsen & Jonas Bruun Nielsen share some observations they’ve made studying gentrification in New York and Bushwick in particular.,When doing anthropological research on gentrification in Bushwick one quickly finds out, that it is not a thing easily done – especially when you’re not even from this country. ,Let’s just say, I’m a Thanksgiving cynic. I can’t help but see bullshit in some of those “Happy Thanksgiving” greetings. I may not be popular, but I can relax in my honesty. There are so many reasons why Thanksgiving can be frustrating. One big reason is loss of control over basics like where and when in regards to eating, sleeping, going places. This is the same reason why I hate group outings, which is the essence of Thanksgiving. The times that I’ve been single are the ones that have bugged me the most. When you are single, you are much more vulnerable to other people’s whims, with no one to complain to privately afterward. Of course then there is the time I was with my boyfriend when I walked into my Aunt Amanda’s house one year and upon seeing me she exclaimed, “You’ve gained weight!” right in front of him.,“And now he thinks that I will uninvite this girl, so that he can bring his other girl…I said, no man, you can’t come!” Flako was passionately explaining the subject matter of his last phone call. “Besides all this creativity I have to deal with this!”,Only 2 hours before ,, Flako was still driving around Bushwick and Ridgewood picking up beer, pastelitos, texting people who had never heard of The Bushwick Starr, and calming me down like it was my huge event to worry about (it wasn’t!). “I have to offer food and refreshments to the people from the hood otherwise they won’t come next time,” said Flako about 100 warm and fresh pastelitos ordered from , on Wilson Ave., , has earned itself a big shiny spot on the Bushwick gallery map. Through consistently excellent programming, the gallery has proven that their shows are not to be missed. I personally think that Studio 10 is getting exponentially better with every show.,Their current show ,is truly remarkable. It is the show that I have always hoped to experience in Bushwick. Richard Garet’s exhibition explores the perception of art through a neurological and metaphysical means., ,Now that your short film or a video art piece is nicely edited and ready to be seen, you are probably asking yourself: ,We have two awesome open calls for you: , and ,., ,With the plethora of new bands popping up in Bushwick and East Williamsburg, it can be difficult to decide which bands are truly worth the audio hunt. We’ve seen many bands come and go; the good, the bad and the ugly, playing in DIY venues, sticky lofts, and dark, dank basements. Sometimes, though, there’s a band that is worth the follow up.  Here at Bushwick Daily, we’ve developed a big music crush on ,. Their non-synthesized music reminds us that there are bands that still play good ol’ fashion rock n’ roll.,Bushwick dogs are howlingly happy this week because they finally got their own playground. A dog run has opened on the north end of Maria Hernandez Park, on Irving and Willoughby.,Dogs and owners are equally excited by the development. “It’s good for them to socialize with other dogs”, says one resident, “it’s good for their temperament.” Charlotte, who owns eleven-year-old Junebug, remarked that prior to the dog park options were very limited. “My friend used to take her dog to the local baseball field, but you had to watch you didn’t get a ticket.”, ,Artist , probably thought that painting on canvas was too boring.  Instead she decided to paint…a cement truck. Dré chose her signature Lisa Frank cheetah print and turned one of the boring trucks into a travelling sensation!,“I was inspired by the 1983 documentary , about New York street artists and the hip hop culture, ” said Dré while shaking up ,purple color spray. “I love how the street artists painted trains and those would then travel through boroughs. I love the idea of an image going ‘all city,’” she smiled., ,How does one get back to life after displacement due to a natural disaster and bad misfortune? By doing the next honest thing. My background in finance and fury says stimulate the economy, and your body. I have scoped out bands and shows that have piqued my interest in Bushwick. So I am throwing someone by the name of “Abraham Lincoln” on it. That’s right, it is my Top 5 Bushwick music picks for the weekend.,Yes to ,. Their sound is full with the hot British Invasion sound. , is providing Little Dragon vibes but her name is Ling Ling. Hi Ling Ling! ,is where it is at on Friday!, ,: It opened, and it’s awful…well, according to ,‘ food critic Peter Wells. For those who haven’t read the complete story, Wells went to Guy’s American Kitchen and was so inspired… er… , by the edibles, that he drummed up an essay of rhetorical questions ranging from “Guy Fieri, have you eaten at your new restaurant in Times Square?” to “Hey, did you try that blue drink, the one that glows like nuclear waste? The watermelon margarita? Any idea why it tastes like some combination of radiator fluid and formaldehyde?”. Wells’ candor is anything but flattering and definitely provokes some cheap laughs at Fieri (because, well, why not?), but conversely makes me think “It can’t be , bad… can it?” Looks like we’re going to Flavortown.

"To have a , weekend feels really precious these days. There is no apocalypse on the schedule, just the pure fun of Bushwick life. N, should not be taken for granted, so let’s be grateful for all the creativity and good people we are surrounded with every day!,Feeling a little nostalgic, I also have to say that here at Bushwick Daily we’ve been collecting and highlighting events for almost two years now. While during the first year we were able to list everything in one short side bar, nowadays we need a , where everyone can list their events because there are just too many things happening every day! Bushwick is maturing and it’s maturing good!,Now let’s take a look at 12 coolest cultural events happening this week!,Weldon Arts, a gallery on Irving Ave that is popular among street artists and other color loving folk, is inviting you tonight to the the opening of Cycle’s ,. They are promising a trip through time and unconscious thought. Music will be provided by DJ I-Truth and drinks from Balls Vodka. Oh yeah!, ,To get a wider view of the Bushwick social engagement action, I talked to a happening bartender who watches people interact socially for a living. I chose ,, a bartender at the bar ,at 253 Bushwick Avenue. Sally likely gets told she reminds people of Scarlett Johansson. She’s been a bartender at various bars in the neighborhood for the past 3 years. I picked Sally to interview because she seems to be a strong, independent young woman with an equally balanced view of men and women. I spoke to her for quite some time before asking her specific questions for this column., Sally is 27. She studied creative writing and acting in college and came to New York, (Bushwick specifically) around 3 years ago from Richmond,Virginia, to pursue her career as a comedic writer/director. She is working on a funny web series and performs at the PIT (People’s Improv Theater) when she’s not making money as a bartender. Sally says that in her time in New York she’s dated a number of guys, and has had 3 relationships. She went on a few OK Cupid dates and stuck with one of them for over 6 months. She’s good at vibing people and when she can, she tries to get some action going at the bar for people who seem interested in pursuing some. On a personal level, she’s professional and says she’s never gone out with someone she’s met while working; she’s not interested in the least. Okay dudes – I challenge you to try to make it happen!,When someone is constantly surveying the room, eyes darting about. Girls tend to fling their hair around, laugh loudly and men might theatrically throw back a shot or stunts. This is all from a specific sample size but you’ll know it when you see it. Someone who is generally restless yet giddy., ,All last week we got , for the Brooklyn Electronic Festival, and now that it’s over, there’s little more to do than brush the confetti off our shoulders and remember the good times. Oh, and share the oodles of trippy photos we got. From , to , to ,, it was an unforgettable dose of electronic ecstasy., ,In the mist of hurricane Sandy and all the damage it has caused, we put our , submission competition temporarily on hold. However, the Take Over had to resume because we received the most beautiful black and white photographs of Bushwick by Italian fashion photographer ,. Simple, elegant yet acute lines and compositions so present in Enrico’s fashion work translated beautifully to his street photography as well. We couldn’t do otherwise but be mesmerized by the material he sent us.,Enrico was born in Rome and originally started off as a lawyer working in the field of intelectual property. However, his passion has always been photography, and soon he resumed his career as a photographer working with UTG Studios. After many years of working as an assistant to known photographers, he his own work has started to be recognized and has been published in magazines and exhibited internationally., ,One word: Amazing! Crowds of you, dear Bushwickians were flowing on Saturday night to , on Bogart Street. Big festivities and 50 lbs of ginger were expected to turn up at this lovely old/new venue. Our wildest party dreams came true and, more importantly, we raised a lot of money to donate to ,.,Bushwick Daily teamed up with awesome party collective ,, and brought you the coolest Sandy Relief Fundraiser around town. The ginger guys provided their resident , who was incredible and played the first part of the night. After midnight, our own , took over the turntables and made the crowd go shamelessly crazy. Bushwick Ginger Social wouldn’t be complete without their signature drinks, Bushwick Gingers, which is whiskey mixed with freshly squeezed ginger juice and ginger ale. The drinks were $5 and were a huge hit., ,Monsters, both in the figurative and literal sense, have been utilized worldwide in cultures for millenniums. Boredom, however, is relatively new to humanity, created by industrialization and fueled into overdrive by digital technology. These two motifs, along with the concept of celebrity, are explored in the form of a sitcom, ,, written, directed and starring video artist Elizabeth Theis, which screened recently at the ,. , is a story about an agoraphobic hypochondriac who believes she is destined to be the next big thing. In her work, Theis often uses themes involving our relationship with media, narcissism, boredom and mortality., from , on ,., ,Who wouldn’t love the dark and quirky TV show Twin Peaks, one of the all time TV legends and a masterpiece by David Lynch? The series pairs especially well with cold, gloomy November nights. Just cuddle up with someone or something, and watch Agent Cooper solving the mystery of the death of Laura Palmer using his intuition and sixth sense. Let yourself be hypnotized with the surprising twists of the plot, strange characters, and natural landscapes…,Here is how you can bring more Twin Peaks into your Bushwick lives right now:, ,, one of our the favorite DIY music venues has just announced they just signed a lease and will be moving to a building at  ,, a few blocks from the Myrtle-Broadway JMZ stop. Silent Barn sounds really excited ,:, ,It has been a week since Hurricane Sandy hit New York City. Thankfully at this stage power is back on in many of the affected areas, and I think we are all grateful to have the subway running back into the city. ,, which is wonderful.,Our coastal neighborhoods, however, will take a lot longer to repair.  Flood-damaged homes are full of sand and sewage-contaminated mud. Power has been cut off until basements are free from water. The clean-up effort is huge, and, as always with lost possessions, very painful. But many hands make for light work… If you want to get involved, there are ,. I volunteered with , on Sunday, and they were really awesome. Although, there are many areas where you are needed., ","

"In the days since Sandy severed all subway service between Brooklyn and Manhattan, many residents on either side of the East River have had to find alternate routes to get to work, or to do really anything at all. If even after this week-long absence of public transportation you’re still unaware of how convenient, independent, cheap, quick, and fun riding bikes is…this is my attempt to convince you., ,We are monitoring the L & G trains for you and keeping you abreast of their operating status. Also we’ll let you know about any other trains that can get you back over to Gotham City and in return. Don’t fret your pretty little souls! , workers are actually trying their best to restore service.

Although, Athena is nothing like Sandy, it is very inconvenient, and , in the ,.,Despite the snow not being very helpful, we can’t help but admire some of the Instagram pictures you Bushwick folks have been snapping whole day. These are the first snow snaps from Bushwick we liked the best… You can also follow , feed, which we <3., , ,An incredible amount of excellent works of art donated to , has been flowing around in the past 3 days.  Bushwick artists proved once again their sense of community and compassion. Additionally, our fundraiser is probably the biggest steal in the history of the art…,If you take into account that a donation ticket is $10, this really is a once in a lifetime opportunity to acquire some serious art, for really really cheap.   Among many great great artists (Deborah Brown, Tamara Gonzales, Danny Arenas, Meg Lipke, Julie Torres and many more), you can find also six , donated by , has been a leading figure in art and technology since 1960.,So what are the Peace Prints and what is their value… “Their price ranges from $1,000 to 20,000 each,” said Andrea Wolf, Director , gallery in Williamsburg.  Here is a little bit from their history.

One stressful area that might not be as obvious: the tension this type of disaster can bring to relationships, especially for couples that aren’t living together. Having to decide who goes to who’s home and when can be difficult to navigate during the mass transit shutdowns (read L train). We all know it’s nothing compared to what some people are trying to manage, but it can be legitimately upsetting to say the least., ,We’ve all been waiting, slowly, patiently, and extremely nervously, for this day to come. Regardless of political views, this whole community (and the whole world) will be on the edge of our seats tonight as the electoral votes roll in. Where’s the best place to Bushwick to settle in, have a stiff drink (or five), and hopefully celebrate later on? We’ve got a few places in mind, just leave your Republican friends at home…, ,Just in time for elections, Nimrod Kamer dropped the fakest fake video in the faking world…. He released a video that faked Obama Sr. filming his son’s birth in Kenya. Before we could even get our active asses to the voting booths, this philospher, satirist, performance artist, comedian, and the only Gonzo Journalist at ,, created the video with the help and heaping sum of $250 to the owner of Bushwick’s own ,.  Bushwick, in a weird and successful twist of fate has officially become a part of 2012 election history, thanks to Kamer., , , is back and better than ever with a sweeping a festival this Friday and Saturday. Having thoroughly enjoyed myself at the beat gathering back in 2010, I’m extremely excited for their new-and-improved festival.

AMAZING., ,On Friday, I traveled from the Upper West Side of Manhattan to Bushwick.

Support local art and go to the openings this weekend, because as , and other places in New York, art shouldn’t be taken for granted.,CCCP, a gallery in the basement of 56 Bogart building is opening a show tonight featuring works of Ron Richter, Boris Tyomkin, Holly Prochilo, Silvia Forese and John Holt., ,Although Bushwick may have survived (,) through devastating Hurricane Sandy, the rest of New York City has not fared so well- Breezy Point, Rockaway in Queens and lower Manhattan suffered among the worst damage. Flooding, wind damage, fires and loss of electricity have placed many buildings without heat, gas or power, and left many hungry and in need to help. There seem like a million ways to help, but even the possibility can be stressful. Here are a few simple ways to help out starting tomorrow and websites to check daily for volunteer updates., ,While many of the neighborhoods in the tri-state area have been devastated by the ravages of hurricane Sandy, Bushwick was “,” spared any serious damage. A large number of Bushwick residents who regularly commute to Manhattan have been forced to stay in the neighborhood, and Bushwick business owners report more customers than ever. “It feels like Bushwick is in this protective bubble,” said Nyssa Frank, the owner of ,, which organizes art classes and exhibitions. “We were so lucky…”,Nyssa wasn’t the only one mentioning the “Bushwick bubble.” Gina Leone and Ben Warren, the owners of bars , and , mentioned it as well. They said that they see about 60% more customers than usual. “It’s really terrible what happened in other parts of the city,” said Ben sadly. Heavy Woods is planning a benefit night for the areas that suffered the most., ,This year’s Halloween turned out a little differently than we all hoped for… Devastating hurricane Sandy virtually shut down the city, caused many tragedies, and lead to the cancellation of the most events around the city. Bushwick was lucky enough not to suffer of the power outage, nor extensive floods; but due to subway system being shut, Bushwick residents have found themselves stranded in our lovely neighborhood. Luckily we have bikes that never let us down. So if despite the general gloomy mood you’re up for some Halloween fun, we have several awesome tips for you tonight.,Alaska won our hearts not only because of the taxidermy deer heads on their walls, but mainly because of their occasional boozy milkshake nights. Tonight they are serving Bourbon Vanilla, Pumpkin Whiskey and Blood (?!) Milkshake. We’ve tried the Bourbon Vanilla one, and hereby swear that it is a beverage to die for. Put on a costume if you feel like it, and dive into pure milkshake pleasure!, ,Halloween is my all-time favorite opportunity to analyze people’s personalities and sexuality by the way they express themselves through their costumes. I have taken the opportunity to  so here with some revelers I encountered this past Saturday night. ,(All photos courtesy of Phillip Buehler.), When I asked Ryan what his costume was, he said Slutty Sex Tranny. I also asked him if he was straight or gay, to which he replied, “I don’t choose my partners based on what sex they are.” This guy definitely gets my vote for ,. You’ll have to wait out everyone else to the end of the party though, and you might run out of energy by then—a burrito will likely distract you from any human no matter how appetizing., ","

Brian is a Peruvian abstract painter with a relaxed attitude towards life who according to his own words can be also very determined. His favorite medium is house paint and raw canvas. Nice!  ”I’ve always loved the behavior of any kind of paint on any kind of surface. Making a painting to me is an escape from contemporary society and helps to bring me back to a more simple and human way of being,” says Brian about his work and life.,Brian currently lives and works in Greenpoint but hangs out in Bushwick all the time.

Emily Tepper is a petite energetic woman with an interesting career path.

Is this kind of readily available sex a good thing? I took to the streets this week to find out how people in Bushwick feel about the dynamics between men and women.,As a pretend therapist I hypothesize that this mostly works great for the appropriately not-ready-to settle-down age group, but I believe that underneath it all there is some defensiveness and fear of rejection.

Deadlines? PSSSHHHH. A first for me, on Friday night I attended a CMJ house party show curated by , at Rock Bottom. The show raged until after 3 am, featuring a slew of awesome local bands- ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , and more. It was an eruption of loud music, crazy dancers, $2 beers, and all-around Bushwick rowdiness. Oh, and an incredible rooftop. I now want to do this every weekend., ,My involvement with , started over a year ago when a proposal I had for a public art project in India led to my first meeting with Peter Hopkins at Life Café in Alphabet City. Anyone who has had a chance to converse with Peter can imagine how I left that first meeting. At age 56 he had more energy, and enthusiasm than anyone I had ever met. We talked for 2 hours, about the art world, India, Detroit and more. We talked about possibilities, not anger or fear. Days after it slowly struck me! I had just met an art world “YES!” person. “Yes” you can make new ideas happen, “Yes” the art world is melting down, but seize the moment as an opportunity, and do not waste your time working on small things, or seeking approval from small people. It made me realize that up until this point that was the attitude that led to the realization of my curatorial projects and my co-founding a non-profit, ,. It turned out that I had met Peter at the right moment. At that time I still entertained the thought that I might possibly be a little crazy to think my life’s motto was – ‘ do something to make a difference.’ I was still confronted by individuals frightened into submission by the old order and the economic crisis. Those people would speak of “risk” and “creativity,” but were more concerned about not appearing “wrong” than they are about what the “new” might actually look like., ,Newtown Creek is getting even creepier than usually! , is organizing a , a twilight tour aboard a (possibly haunted) NYC Water Taxi.,, dear friends, is an estuary that forms part of the border between Brooklyn and Queens, and currently also is one of the most polluted sites in America… Newtown Creek Alliance is a community-based organization dedicated to restoring, revealing and revitalizing Newtown Creek. They also have been organizing boat tours of the Creek for some time now. For Halloween they are promising something extra spooky and mysterious….    ,What can I say about the re-vamped , that I couldn’t say about the former Party Expo?  Well, there’s a chandelier.  And the walls are black!  Matte black. As if everything was covered in gaffer’s tape.  There’s a pool table.  There’s what I would describe as a clear “standing-pod” off to one side, in which you could stand if the mood struck.  But most importantly, there’s large bar running the length of the left wall.  That’s a huge improvement for anyone who visited the old Party Expo in it’s waning prohibition days, a time when patrons were viciously foo-fooed for BYOBing but then fuck it you’ve already bought a six pack of tall cans so like secret frat boys or teens at a Young Life retreat you periodically sneak off to the bathroom to shotgun a can or two.  ,If you have only one spot for some loving hipster snarkism in your Twitter heart, it better be reserved for ,…  Because, dear friends, Hipster Haiku is excellent!,“,,” says the bio of the mysterious haiku master.

Here is our list of worthwhile things to do in LIC, from museums, to parks, to recreation., ,This 19th century schoolhouse holds some of the most current art available in NYC; it is one of the oldest (and largest) nonprofit contemporary art institutions in the US, founded in 1971. Various kinds of new and experimental art in all media are displayed throughout the space, and MOMA PS1 considers itself more of an exhibition space, rather than a “collecting institution.” As indicated by its name, PS1 is affiliated with the Museum of Modern Art.,Each summer, PS1 launches their weekly “Warm Up,” a music (often DJs) and dance extravaganza held in the courtyard of the museum, surrounded by the winner of the “Young Architects Program,” usually in the form of a large scale art piece that consumes the place. Inside is the newly opened ,, the creation of Sarah Obraitis and Hugue Dufour of M.

I’m also in a great mood because I’m going to use a big gift certificate that I got 2 years ago, to go on a little trip this week. Hopefully, by the time you’re reading this, I will be whooping it up, creating some problems of my own.,Basically anyone or anything that samples Tupac get’s a free pass from me., ","

"In the past couple of weeks we checked out a bunch of shows in Bushwick and beyond. We would like to particularly mention four excellent galleries, their current and upcoming shows: Theodore:ART, Inter State, Bull and Ram and Regina Rex.,At ,, it was all Barclays Arena protest talk. In a very timely manner, Stephanie Theodor curated a solo show of Peter Krashes who also happens to be one of her yearlong favorite artists. Peter Krashes is a painter and a civic activist, for whom protesting and his artistic practice come together in a natural unity. In his works he repeatedly analyzes the role of media in a protest, the means of protest and engagement of the local residents., ,What a brilliant idea! Last week we published , addressed to all Bushwick artists to send us their portfolio websites. Every week we will pick one artist whose art will make our Facebook cover. It’s a win win for everybody. You get exposure and we won’t get bored of our Facebook cover!,Honestly, we weren’t quite prepared for the large number of amazing portfolios we received! Bushwick photographer , caught our eye immediately. Naturally, part of the reason was that we are photo junkies here (even though the call is open to all sorts of visual artists), and also because Johnny’s photographs show our beloved hood a little bit differently than we are used to seeing it. Johnny Panessa has the fresh eye of a frequent traveler while he masterly captures publicly intimate moments of this neighborhood’s diverse inhabitants. He is travelling in Portugal as we speak.  “It’s just easier to make photos when on the road seeing things fresh. There’s so much going on in the streets…” we agree with Johnny who moved to Bushwick in 2005.  ,While walking down Forrest Street during this past summer, I’d often see an open garage door. Inside was a man in bright shorts with a large, black beard with many paintbrushes. He’d usually be standing near a wall working on a tapestry filled with fantastical nude creatures.,On occasion I’d stop by to see how they were coming along. Sometimes he’d be meticulously working in the borders. Once, while repeating a floral pattern he turned to me and said, “I can’t believe I started doing this to myself. These borders take a lot.” , is the second largest U.S. urban indie music festival after SXSW. If you’ve never experienced it in years past, now’s the time! Although most of the “official” shows take place in Manhattan, we’re making it easy for you to see a plethora of awesome bands, without a badge and for pocket change, without even leaving the ‘hood!, ,Every Monday at 5pm, , & , broadcast LIVE, right here on Bushwick Daily from jojo’s studio in Bushwick.  As you know the shows always range from hip-hop, freestyling, live jazz, pumping house music, to old analog tape and vinyl. Naturally there is a lot of talking, comedy, culture, and FUN FUN!,For the upcoming weeks we have invited a couple of really cool guests, which gives you even more reasons to tune in every Monday at 5pm. Oh and don’t forget to join the chat and tell us how you like the music, guests, jojo and RG!,Upcoming Special Guests include:  ,We are pretty bummed here at Bushwick Daily that we have to break this sad news. , is closing down. One of the most distinctive galleries at 56 Bogart and in the neighborhood as well, has released a note addressed to their friends and supporters last night. “,,” writes the gallery director and the curator of the galleries in the building, Peter Hopkins. Peter Hopkins doesn’t explain the details of his abrupt end at 56 Bogart. In order to obtain an explanation, we tried to reach the owners of the building Ted Hovivian and Adrienne Saccone by phone, however we didn’t have any luck.,Peter Hopkins regrets to end the 14 months at The Bogart Salon. However he is promising some exciting news for the future: relocating to another location in Bushwick and an “even bolder and more expansive vision for art and culture.”  ,When I moved to Bushwick from Los Angeles, I knew this scene was a force to be reckoned with. I mean, the amount of facial hair alone is pretty intimidating… It has taken me just about a year to navigate this ‘hood true LA Chola style-drunk and disorderly with my music blasting!’ I checked out this show last week at  , in Williamsburg. I have been to this spot over 20 times since moving. I am that girl in the shadows sipping on Vodka head-bopping. I have put in my time, and $1, 000s of bucks at the bar.,The line up for that Tuesday was of a hodgepodge of local bands and visitors. I did a solid walk around the room to throw my vibe out, and hit the bar. Hard. I just didn’t know what to expect, and was by myself.

"On a Saturday, I went to , for a punk rock powerhouse where Malcolm, ,, ,, ,, and (my personal favorite), , all played.  All of the bands are from or formed in Brooklyn. It was my first time in the industrial space. The drinks were strong and the bands were excellent., ,You guys suck! Seriously, I only got two letters this week and lucky for you one happens to be from a brilliant comedian who I’m a fan of—alright, truth be told I asked her to submit—I had to! I don’t understand why you aren’t taking advantage of the opportunity to get free advice from a non-licensed therapist with more than ten years of experience. OK, so I don’t have a license for therapy but in exchange, I have a license to tell the truth., ,On a largely industrial strip of Melrose Street (save the apartments closer to Irving Avenue) a brightly painted rolling door covers a former auto repair shop. Last Saturday afternoon, under a dark cloud cover, groups of people continually walked into the fenced-off yard next door as noisy psychedelica poured out. The scene from the outside-in couldn’t have been more suitable. After all, this was ,’s One Year Anniversary in their Bushwick location.,Different than any other gallery in the neighborhood, Secret Project Robot hosted their anniversary in the afternoon. “We wanted it to be for kids and open to everyone,” said Rachel Nelson (no relation). That became evident during the opening set of psych-prog band Oneida, when one of the member’s toddler sons joined his dad and the rest of the band onstage. The crowd cheered him when he left.  ,Between the furniture designer and the buyer is a space that is currently empty in Bushwick. Hopefully, not for long! Sean Hackett, the founder of , plans to open a store in Bushwick. Its future customers will have a chance to connect with the designers and artists working in woodshops and artists studios in the area. “A neighborhood needs more than bars and restaurants to develop,” says Sean in their Indiegogo campaign video and we have to agree. We would love a nice furniture store and shop for some locally made stuff. KERF is currently raising some capital through , in exchange of your generous help. Throw them a buck or two, if you can, and start looking forward to KERF! If you’re a designer interested in showcasing at KERF, get in touch with Sean (thisiskerf(at)gmail.com),Try to talk about Bushwick and its future to ten people, and you will get ten different opinions. The funny thing is that these ten different people will likely never talk to each other about it. While Bushwick is a favorite topic among artists who regularly hold , on creating a sustainable future of some sort for Bushwick, some of the important actors on the scene are rarely invited. After I realized that realtors speak a very different language and have different paradigms when it comes to Bushwick, I thought that a trip to midtown would be worthwhile. I talked to Eric Karmitz from Halstead Property, who is the salesperson for the 260 Meserole building that is currently for sale.,…which, by the way, is the building where ,.    ,We know you love your bicycles, so we’ve got good news: we’re giving one away. No, we didn’t scrounge up a vintage Huffy with pegs and streamers (that’s so last year). We got our hands on a sweet new game-changing commuter bike from one of the coolest and most conscientious bike makers around: ,.,VANMOOF, headquartered in the Netherlands (yeah, the country that managed to essentially ban cars from ,), is dedicated to bringing bicycles back to power. In this vein, it has produced the ultimate city bike: the ,. It’s made of light-weight aluminum, so you won’t get a sweaty back after riding over the Manhattan bridge; it’s got an integrated chain lock, so you’ll never lose it; and it’s outfitted with super-bright, pedal-powered Philips front and rear lights so you can see and be seen at night.,Did we mention this thing looks awesome? Don’t just take our word for it. VANMOOF has won serious design awards for its bikes, including the prestigious Red Dot award and the Dutch Design Award; and the VANMOOF 5 has received the EUROBIKE and BikeExpo awards, among many others.,One of you lucky readers is going to take this baby home. So what are you still doing here? Opt into the contest by giving VANMOOF your email below and earn extra entries by following them on facebook & twitter and sharing the contest with your friends.,Ean Murphy’s , class at , is probably one of the best deals for young artists.  Really.  If you’re an artist who never took that finance class during undergrad (all of you) and you want to start marketing and selling your art, check out 3rd Ward’s stock of ,. In the three-hour course Bookkeeping, I found myself repeating “so that’s what that means” in my head.   ,Hadar Pitchon’s vision of hybrids, emotions, and the future are what makes his ,, as well as his ,, visual Meccas for young, burgeoning male models, equally talented photographers, and top model agencies. What stands out about his work is that he’s extraordinarily self-aware about his environment and about the times he lives in. Hadar doesn’t blindly collect beauty. He puts himself in front of his own camera with equal zeal and vulnerability. With Hadar, it isn’t just about the photography, or executing a simple narcissism project. His process is meta in its approach, timeless in feeling, a performance art on the gritty streets of life.  ,The heat is on! The 5th year of Bushwick Film Festival officially kicks off tonight at 7pm, and will continue through Saturday and Sunday. The festival is a carefully curated 3-night long celebration of film consisting of short and long features from Bushwick but also from around the world.

"I’m in the Triangle, the outdoor home to the Bushwick Five Points Festival of Summer 2012. We’re smoking and chatting with the Five Points’ street art patron and curator Joe Ficalora. Joe has been good enough to show me his favorite street art pieces, sprayed expertly on the concrete walls of Joe’s family business. Frank, Joe’s business partner and childhood friend, now passes me a cigarette within the confines of the mysterious Triangle as this native Brooklynite talks about growing up in Bushwick, and bringing art to its streets., ,You don’t have to leave the hood if you want to watch Debates tonight. Besides that I think that we all will need a drink.,To watch the first first debate of the 2012 election season, head to ,on 24 St Nicholas Ave, off Jefferson L. The Bodega guys will pour shots of Arrogant Bastard (which is a beer kinda awesome for this occasion) every time Romney says, “I’m for the 100%.” Apparently, you’re getting wasted…,Another awesome spot to show Debates tonight is , on 12 Grattan off Morgan L! They will have a raffle to win drinks!,We figured that since , so much nowadays, , will be showing debates too. But they said they will only turn it on if customers request it. So if you want to watch Debates with a democratic slice, go request it.,If you live in/closer to Ridgewood, you will appreciate that ,will turn it on too. Nothing is better than to spit and argue in an old fashioned beer hall, am I right?,Alright, folks, so drink wisely and no fights, please! And if you know of other places that will show Debates, please leave us a comment, and read , ,The first annual Bushwig had everything a drag show should have: charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent. I arrived in native dress, an outfit styled by my friend at Fashionindie.com. She is as daring as she is colorful, and I ended up riding my bike through Bushwick in galaxy tights, leopard boots, sequined cape, and blue wig. But don’t worry, I fit right in among the birds of paradise in the backyard of Secret Project Robot.,Cher Noble, in scarlet plumage, performed “Model for Me” by Jer Ber Jones on the Secret Project Robot outdoor stage., ,Here’s a video we can all learn from.

Joe always put his art (acting) first, but then had to learn how to be practical about self-promotion. Do you see yourself in here…maybe just a little? I do!, ,Meeting someone like Richard Haines must make you fall in love with Bushwick again and again. If you didn’t know Richard Haines is besides a really kind person, also a top notch fashion illustrator who lives underneath the JMZ tracks. Richard is a dreamer who made it to the front rows of fashion shows (also) thanks to his blog ,. On his blog he records his sketches of cute (mostly) guys he meets and things he likes day to day. ,, Richard went to Molasses Books and he loved the place! He sketched Matt the owner., , ,Whiskey and ginger mix really well. And if you add a little bit of rooftop fun with your friends in Bushwick, rad DJs, and a relaxed atmosphere, an amazing Saturday night is guaranteed! Vernon Caldwell, Ian Evans, Chris Schwartz and their friends are Bushwick Ginger Social, and they know how to party really well.  , ,We received some very sad news yesterday. ,, the drummer of Bushwick band ,, died as a result of a bike accident. As,, Connor was found with severe head trauma yesterday morning in Bushwick. To be exact, he was killed on his bike at the intersection of Metropolitan Avenue and Stewart Avenue at around 5:15 a.m. (,) He was taken to Woodhull Medical Center where he was pronounced dead. It appears he likely was the victim of a hit-and-run accident. This comes as a huge blow to the Bushwick music scene and to bikers everywhere. He was 24 years old.

"Put that bow tie on and get ready to sip some cheap beer while intellectually discussing art! Friday in Bushwick means A LOT of art openings,  and here are four of them you should definitely pencil into your social diary!,CCCP stands for Creative Curator’s Collective Program and North Light is for sure one of the most liberal galleries at 56 Bogart. They have an event called ,scheduled for today to accompany their current art show ,, so pay them a visit today 6-8pm., ,At 56 Bogart you are rather likely to see more than one gallery show, which is very practical especially in an eventful neighborhood such as Bushwick. NURTUREart, one of the area’s most significant non-profits is having an opening of ,, the first solo exhibition of Scott Lawrence.  Lawrence works in sculpture, painting, drawing and manipulates everyday objects.,Big cheers for , is happening tonight at The Loom Gallery! Holly Shen Chaves has been invited to curate an art show related to film to support Bushwick Film Festival. Holly who has been involved with , as a lead of the in the bloggers for Bushwick Open Studios and recently also with Bushwick Daily, has curated an exhibition to offer a contemporary response to structuralist film concepts from the late 1960s and 70s.,Multitalented artist and blogger Jen Hitchings decided a couple of moths ago that it’s time she opens her own gallery. She divided her studio at , into the part where she works and into the part that serves as a gallery, proving everyone that everything is possible if you only want it… micro/MACRO is the second exhibition curated and held by Jen Hithcings.,Last week we posted ,. This week it’s the ladies’ turn. …and you can hum , while looking at these lovely ladies we met in the Bushwick streets…,Nestled on the corner of Myrtle Avenue and Charles Place (a small, no-outlet road about a block down from Bushwick Avenue mostly known for the cafe ,), a new vegetarian pizza place has just opened up., ,Last Saturday, at ,s first sold out show, ,, , and , smashed. It poured, there was crowdsurfing, the mosh pit found a new home, fans looked like madusa (see above), $4 beers were chugged, and the music was loud. Thee Oh Sees and Ty Segall are similar but different garage-punk bands from the Bay Area that share a fan base- what could make for a better co-headlining tour? They were joined by local sludge metal/punk band ,, who shouted “We’re your neighbors!” before diving into their first song., ,I’ve had the pleasure of , , two of the three art exhibitions I’m about to write about. I’m coming around to the opinion that art should be experienced with a lucid detachment. The kind that comes with waking up next to it as the sun begins to shine in the large loft windows of an old garment factory.,No coffee. No cigarettes. Just a good deal of blinking and possibly a stretch. Things come to you in waves. The realization that a day has begun sinks in and the only consolation is your surroundings.,It’s a paradox, but maybe blogging about Bushwick makes you not realize all the changes that happen right in front of your eyes. “Everything is different! Look at all those new bars!” said ,, one of my all time favorite street artists who was working on a mural with N’DA when I ran into him biking down Jefferson St. yesterday. “True…there are at least 10 new bars,” I thought to myself. Over Under left Brooklyn a couple of months ago to spend some time on the West Coast; his absence probably made him see all the changes more clearly.,Bushwick is clearly becoming the hot destination for entrepreneurs in the bar and restaurant business. The question is whether the neighborhood really needs so many new bars. Try to walk into any of these places on a Saturday night and the ratio of staff to guests will be your answer (I think it varies from very crowded to very empty). It also seems that most of these new establishment owners are seriously nice people who came to Bushwick to fulfill their life-long dream, and are really supportive of each other. It really shows if someone is running a place with love, and the new places are mostly really great.  The last, probably the most important questions on everyone’s mind is,  how will all the new places influence the rents in the area…,Let’s count the new bars and/or restaurants together….  ,When , decided to have a family and headed over to Park Slope there was a sense of emptiness. In its place opened Broomies, which I personally loved for its weekly trivia night. When that closed I lamented loudly over where I would get to play trivia, but after a month of being closed something amazing opened in its place, ,….

Please email me at: , Send me your questions, dilemmas, even your own advice that you want to share and I will post responses to your questions and issues right here on this site. , I will be taking some of your issues from these sessions and posting them in this column as well., ,It’s been my habit to “photowalk” around the ,, where Scott Avenue ends at the intersection of St. Nicolas Ave and Troutman St.  On Friday morning (afternoon?), I felt hungover, when I heard the tell-tale sound of a spray can being shaken. Little did I know that the artist I spied spraying was painting the entrance to the ,, the outdoor performance venue of the Bushwick’s Five Points.

" ,In case you are the last person in Bushwick who hasn’t heard yet, Roberta’s was closed on Friday night. Yes, Bill and Hillary Clintons dined there. That’s why.,.,Here is our little contribution:  ,I seemed to just have been asking friends, “What happened to all the bike-in movies in Bushwick this summer?”. They seemed few and far between. Then, last week, ,, ,, answered my ponderings and announced a free bike-in showing of the , documentary ,in collaboration with ,. The showing was a great warm-up for a Saturday evening- $6 draught, delicous sausages were available at the food truck,  and the beer benches were packed.  ,…something like this goes a conversation between Rachel and Kurt in the last night’s episode of , Britney 2.0. What exactly is going on?  , kind of feels like that weird part of the internet when it’s about 4AM. You wonder if you’re only there because you can’t brain anymore.,Someone else did the legwork down the tubes for me and introduced me to the most wonderful artist blog I’ve seen in a long time. So free your minds, you old lesbians and check it out. ,I know, I know! I can’t wait for Bushwick Film Festival either! It’s ready to kick off on ,. Before the independent film craziness happens, BFF is inviting you for the , tonight 9pm-4am at Paper Box! It’s $5 to get in before 10pm and $10 after 10pm., ,There’s a new restaurant opening in the neighborhood today, September 21, 2012 at 41 Wilson Ave. It’s called , and the chef describes it as “ England meets Vermont”. Their back garden is quaint with barrel tables scattered amongst regular tables. The ivy-laden walls strung with Christmas lights gives it a DIY Bushwick aesthetic. People sat around smoking their fags and sipping on house cocktails, wine or ales. ,It was nighttime, I was picking up the keys for , from Annelie McGavin at ,. I spoke with , and then to his friend Steve Mykietyn. ”You should stay at Steve’s place.” Ben said, “He has an art gallery in his home.” He then turned to Steve, “They’re staying at my studio tonight” and filled him in on the rest of ,.,“Sure. You’d sleep one night?” Steve asked.,“And document it. How does next Tuesday sound?”,“Ok. Let me give you my number.”,I took it down and said “I’ll find you on the internet.”,“It’s tough to do that. My name is spelled phonetically.” ,One of our favorite Bushwick people, poet , is involved with ,, “a reading and writing sanctuary for kids, a safe space for self-expression in the neighborhood of Bushwick, Brooklyn.” He asked us to spread the word because Still Waters is now looking for kind and patient volunteers to help children ages 6 to 14. You will sit next to a child and encourage her into literacy! How amazing! Flako says that they have about two dozen kids a day that need help. The hours are any portion of 1-5:30, Monday through Thursday, and Saturday. Even two hours a week can change a life for the better., ,Of course Bushwick needs its own Fashion Week(end)! It’s one of the ‘duuh’ moments when you have to wonder how come nobody thought of it earlier. In the land of fashion creatives (among other types of creatives) it makes a lot of sense, and we aplaud to Nyssa Frank from , for making this idea… you know… living…  ,Imagine that you wake up in a house that is shaking. No, it’s not an earthquake; it’s a crack running up the apartments. How come? Well, apparently because of the construction next door. You are evacuated from your home and proceed to wait for the next development. That’s what the residents of 420 Melrose have been experiencing for a little over a month now. In August, the media spread the story widely. Daily News wrote:  ","

"Rafael Fuchs in a dress and Meryl Meisler setting up a photo shoot with the Rabbi from the Chabad. This is how The Studio at the Bushwick Community Darkroom’s opening looked after a few bottles of wine were down., ,Photography for Bushwick Daily is an inseparable way of portraying the whereabouts of our neighborhood.  Naturally, if a big photography event happens in Bushwick we are beyond excited!  ,I woke up on Saturday morning after a night of fun and fantasia at the ,, and yes, I was hungover.  My favorite remedy for such a diagnosis is a nice walk, coffee in hand, amongst our favorite hulking warehouses.  Electric chords of music meander through open windows as I waltz, equipped with heavy-duty UV sunglasses and a camera.  On Meadows there was the intoxicant whiff of spray paint on the air.  I stumbled onto Bogart, and Lo! Here were some friendly street artists collaborating on a wall space.,
Need a cure for that frayed party soul of yours?  Check out the art that was going up on Bogart between Meadows and Stagg.  Owns, an established neighborhood artists you may recognize, commented that the work was going on all day, and some LA artists were showing up periodically to contribute.  Here are some images of the two gentlemen hard at work.,
Get out there Bushwick!  ,Brooklyn is right to be proud about its diverse food scene, but it’s no secret that Queens also has a lot to offer when it comes to food, too. The borough is known especially for its authentic immigrant food – Greek, Mexican, Colombian, Uzbeki – but Long Island City in particular has become a home to European-influenced and New American dishes, as well as myriad artisanal foods. LIC continues to gain a reputation for excellent eats.,We love you, Brooklyn – hey, you’re just over the bridge from LIC. So come visit – bike (the Pulaski has a safe bike lane), walk (it’s a short walk, we promise), drive (we have parking), take the ferry (from DUMBO or Williamsburg), or take the subway (7/E/F/M/N/Q/R, and the G). We’ll feed you well.,Here are some places we think you’d like to check out when you’re hungry. We’ve grouped them by street, and most are accessible by subway, at the least.,If tasty pub grub and an seemingly endless beer list appeal to you, Alewife has your number. It’s only a couple of blocks from the Vernon-Jackson 7 stop, and shows off with a beautiful, warm dining room and terrific group of bartenders and servers to help you out. We’re partial to their fries, which come with parmesan and truffle oil. The burger is also terrific., (,) ,Would you like to meet a cute guy in Bushwick? So just go out… Because cute guys are everywhere; of any age, of any type, doing all sorts of activities. So, you’ll definitely find your match ,  Here are six cute guys we encountered in Bushwick streets.,Are you too lazy to walk your dog? Think twice! You might encounter this very cute guy while he’s walking his (also very cute) dog (we don’t have a picture of the dog as we were too distracted, ehm…).  ,All the cute and hand-made stuff calls , its home. This lovely boutique located at , has been around for a couple of years now bringing together a community of local designers, crafters and artists. If your eyes are hungry for cuteness, Better Than Jam is you destination! I stopped by on a whim to say hello to Karin Persan who runs the store and see what’s new.  ,Is it fall yet? I don’t know how about you but I feel like snuggling the fabric out of my blanket! I would read poetry books and watch good movies…. Now we have these five great events in Bushwick (and beyond) where you can snuggle with a greater style than ever. (Quick question for a poll in the comments section: Is it ok to snuggle a blanket in public?),Here is our very snugly selection of events for this week:  ,It’s been a couple of months since we totally fell for ,, and launched our ,. Every Monday at 5pm, our own , spins like a crazy machine and cracks jokes with his buddy RG. Hip hop, R&B, salsa, whole bunch of unexpectedly obscure tracks and also live rappin’ or jammin’ – all of that you’re been regularly hearing right here on our website. Today, jojoSoul has something special for all you! He pulled out his old toys – discontinued audio, live mics, analog player and he will try their sound. Naturally LIVE at 5pm, so tune in, and let the guy know , how you like his old toys….  , Tell me about 2012. ,Your meteo-sensitivity will be on alert when you come to , this weekend.  Deborah Brown, curator and the owner of the gallery chose an interesting duo of classically trained painters: , (in the main space) and , (in the project room). Common to the work of both artists is the dense atmosphere created by the weather, whether it’s an apocalyptic gloominess of Karen’s tornados or foggy peacefulness of Kerry’s Empire State Building.  ","

I searched using ,, a great Instagram photo viewer, by tag , and found almost 22,000 images. Most recently, there are over 200 instagram images tagged Bushwick each DAY.

The band, who dashed around the BK music scene with brass, punk-garage tunes, first made a name for themselves in 2010 and played as recently as last month. The band is known for their widespread appeal (they have fans in Europe!) and unique sound- difficult to label, it falls somewhere between rock and operatic punk. And it’s very Brooklyn. There’s beauty trapped in the webs of their haunting lo-fi sound, bursting vibrato guitar and static drums falling in tune to lead singer Caitlin’s soaring, classically-trained vocals that produce spooky harmonies. ,Two ideas were organically integrated into nearly every discussion during the citydrift panel discussions over the weekend.,1.

"After a good Sunday night’s sleep, we woke up to a fresh almost autumn day and to our new website! It will take us a couple of weeks of twisting and tweaking to get every single detail in place but, for the most part, the website is working great!,As I mentioned on Friday, one of the biggest and most exciting changes is that we are crowd-sourcing our events calendar! Previously, we have been simply listing all the (greater) Bushwick events we’ve heard about, which wasn’t always complete or ideal for orientation. Now we are opening the doors to everyone who is organizing fun stuff in Bushwick and wants to share it! You can simply add your event in our event section on the right, and have it displayed directly on our homepage! As a reader you can simply click on Events and browse them according to the categories and subcategories that are of interest to you.,We strongly believe that this democratization and crowd-sourcing of events calendar will create a better informational flow and a lot of joy to everyone! Do you have any suggestions on how to improve it? And how do you like our new website? Leave us a note in the comments!,Thank you, Bushwick!, ,Soap bubbles, tiny tequilas, violently damaged ,, poetry, industrial landscape, multi-person ping pong, Joy Ride…and I have barely started to describe how was the Friday night in the name of ,.,Citydrift is a project created and produced by Peter Hopkins (who wrote a , about it) and Meenakshi Thurikode, both from ,. After Bushwick, citydrift will take place in other cities of the world.,On Friday night, small groups of about 2 to 10 people began to drift from one of the ,. Experiencing accidental or intentional art of the night Bushwick landscape was the goal of the Friday night drifting, and participants were sharing their experience on social media using the hashtag #,. I joined the drift of Meenakshi Thurikode and naturally I couldn’t pass a drift organized by , titled , Mama Joy’s hired an awesome car illuminated by crazy LED lights and was offering free rides to Mama Joy’s. Meenakshi, referencing an old Indian myth, was prompting her drifters as well as other randomly encountered people to whisper a wish in her ear that was promised to come true. Other drifters on her experience team included poets Modesto Flako Jimenez, Zohra Saed, Kiran Chanda,  and artists Soek Hyun Han and Ken Kocses.,Saturday and Sunday were dedicated to , that all had one basic underlying question in common: “What are we building in Bushwick? Can we create a model that serves to the good of all?”,Here is what we experienced:, , ,No, this is no grandma’s rant about how everything changes before you even get used to the old stuff. But the truth is that big changes are coming for Bushwick Daily. Some really, really good changes. Consider it a present from us to you by occasion of our approaching second birthday…,The first thing you will notice on Monday morning when you load Bushwick Daily page (and I know that that’s the first thing you do after you wake up, am I right? [wink]), is the brand new web design!,We’ve had the current design for almost a year, and as much as we like it, we think it’s time to move on. Together with our neighborhood, Bushwick Daily has been growing: we have had more contributors [looove!] and have been doing more comprehensive coverage of our beloved pigeon town [fun!] and there have been some really good events [paarty!]! The new site will reflect the direction where Bushwick Daily is going, and also will be a better tool for the community to find out about all the stuff we love and talk about in Bushwick. It will be easier to look for the posts and topics you’re interested in, and most importantly we will have a new, absolutely brilliant events calendar! Bushwick is growing into an exciting arts and culture mecca, and we need to inform more effectively about what’s going on in town. New calendar will enable the venues and members of the community to register and list their events on Bushwick Daily for free. Naturally, we will continue highlighting the events we like the best by creating top weekly events and editor’s picks.,All these exciting changes are happening thanks to our collaboration with ,, who have been pampering a number of rad neighborhood blogs into perfection.,I could obviously talk about this for hours (and I didn’t even mention new cute icons, did I?) but it’s probably better to simply see it. So I’m wishing you an amazing (really) eventful weekend, and I see you on the other site!, ,Do you loooove music? Are you a skilled writer (and potentially photographer)?  Are you familiar with the Bushwick Music scene? How about all these cool DIY venue that are popping up? Do you want to be a music writer for Bushwick Daily?,We are hosting an open call for music writers. If you’ve got what it takes, or just want to try it out, drop us a line!,bushwickdaily@gmail.com, ,Gritty nitty Bushwick, DIY, semi-legal, semi-dirty venue underneath the loud JMZ tracks… If you’re going to  XPO929, make sure to put some colorful plugs or even better toilet paper in your ears… Some things are just true classy, Bushwick…  ,For Bushwick, this summer’s art exhibitions were few and far between. There was a tendency to go for long exhibitions high on concept, NURTUREart’s , comes to mind as does Norte Maar’s ,.,The same can be said for my pick of the best show of the summer, ,‘s month-long hosting of the , ,. Also known as ,, conceptualized and created by the duo ,. This year’s iteration, formerly held at Death by Audio in Williamsburg and now heading to Berlin, featured walls made from twine, ,, and interactive art pieces hidden within the maze.,The best part about this exhibition was how much it loosened up the participants up. I didn’t see another show this summer, including during Bushwick Open Studios, that organically inspired this much conversation between people. You weren’t being told to buy into anything when you entered, you were given a plane to explore. What you got out of this show was entirely unique to you and depended only on your willingness to enter. Even if  you hated the experience, it was a success, I have yet to hear an indifferent opinion on this show.,Synthesized pop tunes, with a sprinkle of a punk rocker’s drums is enough to get me hooked on any song, let alone an album. , new EP ,, encapsulates the playful synth-noise-pop tunes. Its whimsical and alluring riffs are enticing and you may end up grooving in your office chair like I did when I first heard the album. Frontman Mike McKeever’s love of spending half his time experimenting with music on his computer and the other half writing concise pop medleys while watching Breaking Bad has helped him create the Noise Pop tunes that are now on the new EP. Their sound is unique, and hard to put your finger on but, trust me, it’s amazing to hear, both through headphones and in person at live shows.,Today, Life Size Maps will drop their new EP Excavate and will have their ,at 285 Kent with Dinowalrus, Xray Eyeballs, Grand Resort, and Psychobuildings. They recently played at McCarren Park and Shea Stadium and will also be making the rounds at CMJ Music Marathon. I had the opportunity to see them play at Shea Stadium. Their Shea Stadium performance made the intimate crowd  sway their bodies side to side. With their addictive songs how can you not resist? Both McKeever and bassist Emily are amazing performers, entertaining the crowd with their dance moves, McKeever rocking out with his luscious locks and playing his mini synthesizer.,The trio that has gone through a few transformations is making a name for itself around the DIY scene.  Life Size Maps consists of current members Mike McKeever, Emily Panic, and Matt Gaffney. Both Gaffney and Emily are veteran musicians. The current lineup met through mutual friends; the former members had to leave due to conflicting commitments.  McKeever has expressed that this is the best Life Size Map lineup.,Where did their quirky name come from? A stoned friend came up with a strange idea: “Imagine if there were life size maps.” The insane thought stuck and a band was formed in 2010 while Mike was an undergrad.,Listen to the album here:, ,Combining crowdsourcing with the perennial trend of participatory art, ,, which will debut this weekend in New York’s most populous borough, is an attempt to produce a “community curated open studio project.” The pilot program is an experimental exhibition organized by The Brooklyn Museum, made capable through collaboration with a host of volunteer delegates coordinating the composite neighborhoods. In order to participate, you must be an artist with a registered studio or a registered voter who can “check-in” at any given location via an Internet application. Participants can nominate up to three of their favorite artists, but only after checking in at a minimum of five studios. Nominations will be tallied from the GO Brooklyn I-phone app, text messages, or numeric codes assigned to each studio on the mobile website. Ten artists with the highest number of votes will be awarded a studio visit from a Brooklyn Museum curator to select work for an exhibition opening at the museum on December 1, 2012.,Despite the numerous (and somewhat exclusionary) parameters of the project, the website is surprisingly clean and well designed. Under the “explore” tab, 12 artists are featured from a selection of randomly chosen studios (out of hundreds of registered locations) and users can also search with a keyword or name. Results are filterable by location, accessibility, and/or medium. The best feature? Registrants can save noteworthy entries to a sharable itinerary list to help organize (and remember) their path.,Over 1750 studios are signed up for GO Brooklyn, making it nearly impossible for visitors to hit every one in the two-day span. To help intimidated art-seekers get started, , to my own , itinerary (subject to change based on ambition level and reliability of public transportation in Brooklyn, which, on any given weekend, is spotty at best.),I am curious to explore studios in the Navy Yard, one of the more historic artist enclaves in Brooklyn. It’s a bit off the beaten path, but well worth the visit in my opinion: waterfront views of Manhattan’s skyline, spacious studios, and an establishment of accomplished, mature artists. ,, located at 63 Flushing, just opened a new visitor center, exhibition space, and coffee spot, in addition to free shuttle service from Downtown Brooklyn. Don’t miss: ,‘s “,“, ,‘s organic sculptures, and ,.,Next on my list are some studios in the Gowanus and Redhook area (with an upcoming , of its own this October, Gowanus is the area surrounding the canal just southeast of Red Hook), but I am most excited to see ,‘s sculptures (I love anything involving taxonomy, shadow boxes and/or miniatures); the figurative paintings of ,; and , refined landscapes, to name a few on my list.,FYI, Kenny’s location – , at 183 Lorraine St. – is home to numerous other GO Brooklyn-registered artists that look worthy of a visit.,If I’m feeling very ambitious, I may try and make it out to some lesser-known areas (for art studios, at least) like Coney Island/Brighton Beach/Sheepshead Bay Area. I want to see , quirky found-object pieces and check out what an enamel shop looks like at , studio.,The plan is to end up in Greenpoint at the end of the day, which is my favorite neighborhood in Brooklyn (after Bushwick of course) because it is home to ,, ,, ,, and several friends’ apartments. Romanian painter , will opens his studio doors, as well as video and performance artist ,. I’m also hoping to squeeze in a visit to , space to see some of her large-scale sculptures in situ.,Check back next week for a recap of the weekend., , , , Julia works in New Jersey but because she loves to live in Bushwick she decided to commute every day. She lives in a house with a garden and three cats.,  Her expressive hat is a good conversation starter., The mixture of all kinds of people – new and old.  ","

" , ,The Brooklyn Music Society’s , opens its third day of music to a crowd that basks appreciatively in this suburbia-esque setting, in these last days of summer. The Historic , sets a tone of green, cropped grasses, white picket fences, and drooping hydrangeas, specimens that could have recently enjoyed a grooming by one of the neighborhood soccer moms. We can end our comparison to the American ‘burb here, however, as artsy hippies, bedecked in fairy wings and draped silks swoop and pose around the hydrangeas. A belly dancer, whose attire chimes with every nubile step, entertains the locals in their lawn chairs, while stage hands scuttle over the main stage in preparation for Los Mas Valientes.,There are burgers and beer, blow-up kiddie pools and face-painted children, but Fall is in the air. The sun is decidedly gone by half-past seven and I’m finally not sweating my tits off in a summer swelter. As Brooklyn-native lead singer Jessica Valiente mounts the stage, I sway to her Latin gypsy flavor and reminisce. What were the highlights of my summer?,Niko and Olivia, true American gypsies, man the only vendor’s table at the fest. They have spent the summer in and around Brooklyn, selling their wares (osseous hand-made jewelry and chai lattes) at events around the neighborhood. I ask them what their favorite shows of the summer were.,“Oh, the Gowanus Ballroom.”  Olivia names her favorite music venue of the summer. She also mentions the Acheron on Waterbury Street.,Niko speaks up from under her black blanket (also a harbinger of Autumn), mentioning that she liked a show at the Vice Gallery in Williamsburg. But her highlight of the summer was the Bushwick Block party.,Los Mas Valientes have switched out to welcome The Grand Masters of Gypsy, house band of the cosponsor of the event, the Mehanata, a nearby Bulgarian Bar. I’m captivated by Yuri Yunakov on the Alto Saxophone, my own weapon of choice when the mood strikes.,Raffael, a DJ at the Mehanata, smiles knowingly at my expression, “Yuri is a living legend in his own country.” He scrawls in my notebook. Raffael’s friend Lucho agrees. Lucho says his favorite show of the summer was the Gypsy Tabor Fest at the Mehanata. The two gypsies point me in the direction of their manager, who says fairly, “I’m drinking,” when I inquire about asking the living legend a few questions.,Instead, I’m happy to run into the beautiful, the exotic, Gamze Ordulu, lead singer of The Grand Masters of Gypsy. The student laughs when I tell her I didn’t understand anything she said on stage, but understood completely. Her first name means “dimple,” and I’m intrigued by her taste in music. Gamze’s favorite show of the summer was at the Millenium Theatre in May (Okay, so technically it’s not summer, but I was definitely sweating in May), where she saw Israeli vocalist Sarit Hadad.,The crowd is warm and smiling after the Grand Masters of Gypsy leave the stage, and the gypsies of the Mehanata have by now convinced me to take another shot of tequila. The women are dancing and the men are smiling, and I must jig in the grass before this Labor Day weekend is over., , ,One drink stood above the rest this summer. It wasn’t Mint Juleps during the Kentucky Derby nor was it one of the twelve Long Island Ice Teas on the solstice.,The best cocktail , this summer was Alaska’s Bourbon Milkshake. This was a special occasion drink to go along with a DJ set of doo-wop and sixties music shortly after they opened. The drink , to come through for a taste and eventually write an article on the best adult beverages with a wink to childhood mixed in., , ,Summer doesn’t end just because the calendar says it’s Labor Day on Monday. But one has to admit that it certainly feels a little different. Whether you like it or not it’s time to wake up from the summer romantic dreaming and GO! …or drift…,While the past weeks floated by sweetly in the form of watermelons and on tops of the roof, the upcoming week is filling me with great expectations and just a (lil), pointy anxiety as is always the case when the number of art openings in the hood exceeds 10. Not only is virtually every gallery in Bushwick having an opening, it’s also a time for two bigger events to happen. , and , will both happen next weekend.,Go! Brooklyn is an all Brooklyn open studio event organized by Brooklyn Museum. “Open your studio and wait for the votes from your visitors,” says Brooklyn Museum. “If enough votes are casted, and if you’re lucky, you might get a show at Brooklyn Museum.” In other words, Brooklyn Museum says that you better send out at least 5 emails to your contact list; create that Facebook event and buy 6 bottles of Trader Joe’s wine, to ensure that people come and vote, because a lot is at stake. I have to appreciate the lesson in self-promotion Brooklyn Museum is trying to teach us here. Yes, it is important to let people know you exist because if they don’t know you exist, does it even matter that you create? Interesting c, had this week Jen Hitchings with a married artist couple Jane Fine and James Esber, who have been collaborating for years and even share a studio, yet Jane decided to Go! and James decided not to Go!,On Monday, , from , and the brain behind another big event next week, , write about the concept and his inspiration. In his essay he pronounced a couple of amazing quotes on creativity and innovation that I wish we all pondered a little longer than usual.,I consider myself a Buddhist, and I like citydrift better. Much smaller budget, much smaller PR, much more concept to it. citydrift invites us to come to one of the participating galleries and join one of the drifts that will go on a walk around Bushwick. Each drift will consist of a small group of people, like 7 or 10, and will have more or less concept to it. What all the drifts will have in common is that you will be encouraged to experience, to perceive, to see, to feel, to drift… Whether it’s an intentionally placed art installation or an accidentally discovered beauty, citydrift is essentially a trip back to the beginning where we ask: Why art? Why feel? And most importantly, it places the emphasis on the experience of art that should bring joy, pleasure and happiness.  Because no matter what they tell you, a show at Brooklyn Museum will not bring you happiness. It will bring you societal recognition, but not happiness. Because happiness is your state of mind when you feel and create out of the pure desire of heart and the only approval that matters is your own., ,Anyway, I wish you an amazing “last” summer weekend. Enjoy and next week, back to work!, , is a sometimes-bearded, ubiquitous face of the Bushwick art scene. But Alexander Duke is also a super friendly artist who has probably seen more artwork and galleries in Bushwick you ever knew about. He was (sort of) on a quest to be invited to be a part of a show but at first was too polite to ask.,He’s created deck designs for Consolidated Skateboards for over 7 years, produces freely distributed zines of original pop art, and is now getting his full sized artworks into art shows around the neighborhood. The first of which was a one night affair at Silky’s Skate Shop in the Loom replete with McDonalds’s burgers and fries as hors d’oeuvres., I tell people that I’m an artist. I work fulltime at a jewelry store. I ride a skateboard. I guess that’s what defines me., Do you work at Silky’s or do you silkscreen there?, I don’t work there. I’m friends with them, they let me silkscreen there. I hang out while they print my shirts., So if I went there now I could find your shirts and zines?, Yeah., How did you get into producing your zines?, I wanted to be in art shows. But I didn’t have the space to produce large pieces and I didn’t know how you get in an art show. So each zine would be a themed art show for myself. It’s easily accessible by people and I can just hand them out.,That’s kind of how that started. You know the Sexy Olympics, the Sexy Man book, etc., You put together a , of a lot of different art shows that you went to around the neighborhood. How many shows would you say you’ve been to in the past year?, Uhh… All of them. [laughs] I don’t know, a lot. Sometimes there would be five or six shows a night and I would map out my schedule of where I’m going in Bushwick and what my path is to other shows so… I went to a lot of them., Can you name any favorites off the top of your head?, The one I went to in the video where they’re doing the butt flexing. That was… you know where the church space is? That performance was diagonal across the street from that church. They had a bunch of cool performances that night.,They were friendly. That was another thing. There are a lot of shows you go to where the gallery is just starting out and everyone there will be friends with each other. So you might not get acknowledged unless you’re outgoing yourself and it sometimes feels weird., How many shirts have you designed? You wear a lot of your designs, but you always have something different., Before I started doing my own apparel, I would design shirts for other companies. So I have a lot from that. Now that I started my company I have eight designs that I’ve released publicly.,There’s a lot of one offs that I made for myself. I just wanted more control over what was on my shirt and didn’t want to wear someone else’s logo., When you were out and about, you said that you didn’t know how to get into art shows., Yeah., Did you ever think about just asking if you could be in a show?, No.,[both laughing],Because, I didn’t think that my art was good enough. I would set all these arbitrary goals, one thing I thought was that I had to get a studio before I could have a show.,I guess I was looking for validation from galleries and thinking that someone would ask me. I don’t know if that was ever going to happen. So I called up Silky’s three days before the first Friday at the Loom and asked if I could have my own show in their space., Did you pass out your zines at the art shows?, Sometimes. At first I wouldn’t because I thought it would insulting for me to show up and start handing out my artwork to everybody. It started in bars and coffee shops. There are five different zines and I’ve made 100 of each., How did you get involved with Consolidated Skateboards?, Persistence. I called them, emailed, and mailed them drawings. I kept doing that over and over until they finally used some. By then their art director quit and I knew the process of how to submit the board design so it could be silk-screened, so I started doing a lot. One year I did twenty designs. Now it’s about one or two a year., Why didn’t you go that route when you were wanting to get you art into the galleries?, I thought about it. When I was working with Consolidated I lived in a really small town and these designs would be sold all across the world. But the only feedback I’d get was “Oh this is awesome.”,Or if I saw someone skating I could say I designed that and they’d say “Oh that’s awesome.”,So even though my work was seen all over the world, the feedback I got was a few people telling me it was pretty cool. I didn’t have much self value attached to my art at the time., How did you come up with the McDonalds French Fry wrappers for the zines during the show at Silky’s?, Well, one of my characters is Ronald McDonald. I called them up and ordered $100 bucks worth of food. It didn’t faze them. I didn’t want to do the normal wine and cheese thing, and people ate it up. There weren’t any burgers left after that show., Any parting thoughts?, Look at my work. I’m going to try to be in more shows so that people can see them in person.,“You bloody New Yorkers…You have it too good,” Peter Murphy said onstage at The Well with the most charismatic British accent you can imagine. I had to agree. This past Sunday, I was surrounded by the most stylish, eclectic mix of hipsters and Goths, all enjoying the show alike.,There is something magical about ,. Every concert there feels like a special occasion. And it actually is. The Well, located in a former warehouse on Meserole Street has been a pioneer in bringing the world-class musicians to our dingy part of Brooklyn. But that’s not the only reason why the happenings at The Well feel so special. The interiors of The Well haven’t been shown to the public yet, and all the concerts of this summer have taken place in a gigantic yard, which is surrounded by construction panels and concrete machinery. When the sun starts to set there, the light turns golden and the industrial wasteland feels so romantically dystopian…The Well is magical. Completely.,Small Black were just hitting the very peak of their performance when I bumped into Brad Hargett from Crystal Stilts. He was simply walking through the yard and chilling, giving me a “yeah-that’s-me” kind of smile and, in fact, there was something very natural and nice about it. I later took a photo of Brad and his girlfriend watching Peter Murphy’s act. Small Black, a cult Brooklyn chillwave band were really cool, making the crowd sway on their new single ,. Later, when Crystal Stilts played, they almost played me once again.  , ,If you’re into ‘80s music, you’ve surely heard of Bauhaus, who are considered to be the first gothic rock band. Peter Murphy used to be the singer of Bauhaus. When the band broke up, he began his solo career and a couple of other significant projects (Dali’s Car). You’re guessing correctly that he was the one who attracted all the Goths to The Well that afternoon. I have to say, I really enjoyed seeing such a dedicated fan base. I couldn’t hide my amazement with the accessories and details of the outfit of the lady in the first picture above. “Oh, that’s nothing, hun,” she said and laughed heartily., ,I am sure that Peter Murphy was aware of the arrival of his die-hards and he did a lot to create an intimate atmosphere at the industrial yard. He ordered the pro photographers to stop photographing during his performance (oh well, that’s alright). He also interacted a lot with the audience, threw in a bunch of anecdotes and seemed to really have communicated with the crowd on an emotional level. And when performing, Peter Murphy was simply classy. He didn’t go on a ride and just shut the door like we see often with younger bands. Peter Murphy surely went on that ride – but he took the audience with him., , , , , , , , , , ,Lively DIY scene is one of the best things about Bushwick! People host parties in their loft apartments and rock shows in their living rooms with cheap (or free!) booze. This past Saturday, the second floor of a former cheap storage space off the Jefferson Stop was the venue for ,. Aputumtu showcases (mostly) rising Brooklyn bands, and this Saturday’s performances featured Gypsy Wigs, Life Size Maps, Gunfight!, Osekre and The Lucky Bastards, and headliners AVAN LAVA. WC Kids DJ’ed awesome pop songs for the growing crowd between each set. All the bands are from the Bushwick area, except Gypsy Wigs who are from across the Hudson in New Jersey.,The lively atmosphere and colorful stage made this showcase intriguing.  Although the crowd was slowly coming to the showcase by the third act (Life Size Maps) the crowd was reasonably large. During the show alcohol was plentiful and cheap as they had a sponsorship from Brooklyn Brewery, which kindly served the audience free beer from 8-9:30PM., , , ,The show commenced with New Jersey’s very own Gypsy Wigs’ African-inspired tunes which reminded me a bit of Vampire Weekend and concluded with AVAN LAVA’s electropop dance music and laser show that got the crowd grooving the rest of the night away., , ,Breakout Sessions V has done itself justice in terms of putting on a good show and exposing great up and coming bands to the public. The performance by Life Size Maps’ synthesized noise pop melodies made me a fan, thus making me heart one of their songs on ,. Their chick bassist was dually a fantastic performer as much as their lead singer. During the remainder of the evening, I began to think of my friends who were unfortunately not in the crowd and I just had to send them a link to Gunfight!’s upbeat southern rock music (that made me tap my toes as if this NYC kid grew up in the South), and Osekre and the Lucky Bastards African punk sound so they could appreciate it as much as I did.,Aputumpu will be rounding out its BreakOut Summer Sessions on September 29th. Stay tuned to hear more about more upcoming performances…,Recently, I was punched in the back of the head by a teenager. This kind of punch is commonly called a “,” in reference to a hunting technique for killing rabbits. This kid was with a group and upon asking around, I’m concluding that this punch was a sort of initiation between them.,It’s also possible that if I had passed out I would have been kicked and stomped and I would have definitely been robbed. This has happened to a few friends of mine, it’s likely that someone stronger punched them. They awoke with their items gone and a , or worse. As though the theft isn’t affecting enough, one may be left with a concussion following such a punch.,The interesting thing about the human brain is how fragile it is even inside that skull. , increases susceptibility to future concussions, and in the event of , one may begin having epileptic seizures, every , has a negative effect on the brain. Going to the hospital is highly recommended by the internet.,What did I do wrong that night?,-I walked slower than normal that night.,-I walked right through the group of teenagers as opposed to going around them. Even if going around them added 15 minutes to my walk, I should have done so.,-I had headphones sticking out of my bag.,-I went toward a darker street (it was a shorter route) as opposed to the more lit up street.,What did I do right?,-I didn’t attempt to fight back nor pull out a weapon after being punched.,That’s about it. I’m lucky that I didn’t pass out. Upon turning around, I discovered the kid who punched me was walking backwards. His five friends were still on the other side of the street waiting to see what would happen.,As soon as it happened, a fire engine blew past with the lights going. I turned around and kept going on my way. Again I was lucky in that they didn’t follow me. But I checked over my shoulder the whole way home.,Be aware and be safe out there.,[,],[,], and , invited me up to their Williamsburg rooftop to discuss ,, the borough-wide open studio event/contest for a show at the Brooklyn Museum stirring criticisms, excitement, and curiosity. One reason for skepticism is that 1,806 artists registered for it, while 4,500+ did for Bushwick Open Studios. The most compelling reason for interviewing them was that Jane is participating in GO! and James is not, despite having been collaborating under the alias , for years, sharing a studio, and being married. Jane and James have both been working artists in Brooklyn since the late eighties., After thinking about it, I ended up feeling like if I didn’t participate and I saw whoever got the show and felt like there work was awful, I know I would’ve been kicking myself for not doing it.,: I feel like at this point in my artistic career, my studio is not really the best representation of my work. To some artists it’s less attractive. Plus we’re not in a building with a bunch of studios in it so not many people are going to come through. You also have to walk through mine in order to get to Jane’s anyway, so I guess it’s not all that bad.,: Yeah a Canadian friend of ours knew about it, and she asked if we were doing it and I said “what are you talking about?” Then we were in Bushwick later that day and I guess they had flooded Bushwick with the fliers, and that’s when we saw the deadline had passed. A week later she emailed me and said the extended the deadline, so we had about 3 days to decide. The strange thing about it is that James and I and the , artists and those who have had reasonably professional careers didn’t even know about it. It seems so professional now. It’s beautifully organized, and it’s not that we should’ve been a priority, but it was just a bunch of emails, and why didn’t anyone get some of us on the phone instead? Is their intention to make it a success and then in the next years everyone wants to be a part of it?,: I think whether or not it’s a success isn’t really going to determine the quality of the show. It should be more a celebration of artists working in Brooklyn. The idea of having a Brooklyn group show that takes place across the whole borough over two days and it just happens to take place in people’s studios, that’d be a really interesting idea. Then you’d also be showing art in a different context, because it’s in studios., Oh yeah Bushwick is going to get the most foot traffic for sure. And then whoever can get the most people to come to their studios is more likely to ‘win’ the show.,: Well there was Open House in 2004 at the Brooklyn Museum. Charlotta Kotik, the curator, it was her idea and in the beginning she said it wasn’t going to be a big salon show. As the months went by, we were lucky to each get two pieces in the show.,: There was also the Salon of the Mating Spiders exactly 20 years ago in 1992 curated by Annie Herron, over on North 1st between Berry and Wythe. It was just an open call to come bring your work and hang it yourself. By the time the doors opened, the line was around the corner. There was literally not a square inch of room from the floors to the ceiling that wasn’t covered with art.,In addition to these shows, the introduction to the Open House catalogue mentions the Gallery for Living Artists, “an exhibition space devoted to the work of those living and working in Brooklyn” in the 1930′s, exhibitions in the early eighties in the Gowanus Canal Art Yard, the , which featured over 200 artists, many from the East Village, which happened in a 32,000 square foot loft in Greenpoint. Another bring-and-install-your-work show happened at the Brooklyn Army Terminal in Sunset Park in 1983.,Though GO! Brooklyn Art is a very unconventional approach to a curated museum show, maybe it takes something this rewarding and accessible to open the closed doors of the thousands of Brooklyn artists to the public. Maybe some are refusing participation out of principle. All in all, no one will be harmed by an open studio weekend, or a show at the Brooklyn Museum. And it does provide an amazing opportunity to all those underrepresented artists out there. So if you are an aesthetic individual, make sure to stop by ,s studio, and say hi to James when you walk through his.,The end of the summer in Bushwick is bitter sweet. On one hand, it’s hard to say good bye to all the summer pleasures; on the other hand, there is SO much to do in fall… The galleries are reopening, the venues are waking up from their summer dream… I suggest we all enjoy every moment of this week in the very summer fashion… Here are our 5 picks this week:, ,Recently, I visited ,, an amazing art studio and a community project of George Ferrandi. , is one of the tenants there whose work totally made me pay attention. Charlotte is classically trained painter from England, and her landscapes and characters are deeply emotional endeavors that will make your throat go dry. Don’t miss the opening of her solo show this Sunday. [highlight]***GUYS, we apologize, we got a little bit too excited prematurely. Brooklyn Wayfarers opening isn’t until next week. However, you can visit them and check out their current show ,, curated by Lena Takamori (gallery hours are 12-6pm).[/highlight], , ,Have you, guys, heard of traveling Ethiopian restaurant?  , pops up always in a different (Bushwick) loacation and serves their delicious vegan Ethiopian specialties and drinks. In addition they have DJs and in ,, there will be a bear giving hungry visitors a hug. It doesn’t get much better than this…,Let’s eat, drink and dance outdoors while we still can, shall we? Secret Projects Robot prepared a summer evening of sensual delights in their backyard. They will be serving tasty treats of Vashti’s & Co., and you will be listening to the sweet sacral sounds of Alice, Soren, and Delphic Sibyl. Only $8 for all these pleasures is a steal!,Dan McBride is a photographer and a filmmaker whose passion for narratives is distinctive when looking at his photos. He is attempting to tell stories with just one frame. We are excited to see a photography show in Bushwick, as they aren’t so frequent. See you at Kave on Saturday!,Body Actualized have been proving since the beginning of their existence that yoga, rave and meditation are very compatible elements to an event. This Friday they will celebrate the end of our hemisphere’s summer with an evening of heliocentric films, yoga, and experience. The heliocentric films are curated by Claire L. Evans, science writer and one-half of the conceptual pop group YACHT that we looove!!  In addition there will be crystal/reiki healing, guided meditation, DJ sets, and projection mapping and interactive installations. Tickets for this spiritually entertaining night are $10 in the presale and $20 at the door.,Bushwick Library, a branch of , is hosting a book discussion group for adults. On September 13 at 6:15pm, the group will discuss the new book by Emma Donoghue ,The novel tells a story of “Jack and his mother, who was kidnapped seven years earlier when she was a 19-year-old college student, celebrate his fifth birthday. They live in a tiny, 11-foot-square soundproofed cell in a converted shed in the kidnapper’s yard. The sociopath, whom Jack has dubbed Old Nick, visits at night, grudgingly doling out food and supplies. But Ma, as Jack calls her, proves to be resilient and resourceful–and attempts a nail-biting escape.”,You can pick up a copy of the novel at the branch where they keep the books the whole month before the discussion. Stop in and check on out with your library card (if you don’t have a card, it’s really easy to get one by bringing NY State ID)., ,[mappress mapid=""79""]","

"I have recently been in lengthy discussion with Katarina Hybanova, the Editor of Bushwick Daily, about ,a project of mine, which has been in development for over three years, and is debuting on September 7,. , is a 3 day “meta” event that seeks to connect over a dozen galleries in Bushwick, dozens of curators, hundreds of  artists, poets, musicians, urban planners, and writers, and thousands (?) of curious, but somewhat skeptical participants in a 72 hour walking, thinking, talking exploration of our “urban grid”.,Describing the “point” or purpose of ,is something I have spent countless hours trying to do with so many people throughout these past years, that sometimes even I grasp for words to help explain it. This morning, in a beautiful moment of serendipity that mirrored the same bit of peculiar logic of ,I stumbled upon the words I was looking for in this quote from Oliver Sacks in his article in the August 27, New Yorker entitled ,where he describes the , for a project like ,in ways I could never quite sum up:, ,was created as an homage to my first gallerist, Colin De Land, and his ground breaking gallery ,In 1986, I had the great fortune to be a part of the beginning of De Land’s amazing endeavors, and I went on to exhibit and collaborate with him for over a decade. During this time I came to witness firsthand the ways that playfulness, and “letting go” can open up powerful states of creativity. He and his partner (later wife) Pat Hearn of the Pat Hearn Gallery went on to found not only their own unique and powerful art galleries, first in the East Village, and then later in SoHo, but also other incredible concepts like the Gramercy Hotel art fair, which originated the idea that the art fair booth ,, rather than necessitating travel to a distant city, like Basel or Cologne, and taking on all the expenses of participating in a fair,Now since done to death, this model was at the time enormously risky, and having been present at the first one, where I sat on a bed talking to a few of the attendees about a drawing of mine that was in the bathroom, I can say with certainty it seemed a poor model for future success. Later, he and Pat helped create the Armory Fair, and it too at that time seemed a project doomed for failure, just like all past attempts to hold a contemporary art fair in New York City had been. The West Side piers was at that time no one’s idea of a “hotspot” for gathering hundreds of galleries and tens of thousands of viewers from around the world., , ,The lessons I learned from these and the other things I saw were, first, to look for “the future” in unlikely places, places most everyone else had decided weren’t worth paying attention to, and second, to not try to replicate other past successful platforms, but instead “let go” of pre-conceived ideas and let your mind…drift.,After his untimely death in 2002, and Pat’s in 2001, I wanted desperately to re-imagine what Colin might do with the collapse of the art economy and wondered what he might now think of how his own successful attempts at changing the ways in which the art world perceives itself had become two more cogs in the machinery of normative culture.,I started to realize how his concept of “letting go” of fears and expectations was essential, and I embraced his willingness to critically inspect “the rules”, all the protocols that govern our daily art behaviors. None of this mattered, though, until I came to Bushwick in 2006 after having spent 23 years in Williamsburg. It’s here that I discovered the same artists and galleries thinking, talking and working in ways I had long since come to believe did not exist anymore. These incredibly thoughtful, risk taking individuals were creating the future; freshly graduated 25 year-old creative minds alongside 60 year-old former “whatevers”, from stockbrokers to recovering artists and everybody in between, all inside a thriving, ethnically diverse community. Most of them seemed completely uninterested in auditioning for somewhere else (Chelsea, Wall Street, the usual aspirant ranks). Most simply decided to , where they were and take the chance to create a new model of what was possible. For an example of this new spirit, look no further than the now-famous Roberta’s, a literal “hole-the-wall” pizzeria on the surface, but that once opened up shows itself to be something much more: a tiki bar, an urban garden, a radio station; an establishment that is open sourced, unpretentious, and deeply responsive to the needs of its community. This is the template of what Bushwick can be.,It is another question, though, whether this spirit can be maintained. It will require a delicate balance that I am at times wildly hopeful for, and at others profoundly pessimistic about. I am, at the very least, lucky enough to have witnessed this change taking place and I hope that , will play its own small part in it. I look forward to reading here in the coming months about the different opinions and perspectives from others from this same place called Bushwick., ,Local artist and activist , was apparently approached by CNN’s marketing team to show a piece of art in pixels in their online art gallery. Since the dawn of the internet the online art gallery has been attempted, first in HTML form and moving into Flash and CSS forms. Since Apple Inc. declared war on Adobe Flash, the quality of these online galleries fluctuated wildly and with great hiccups.,It would seem that fuller scale mainstream acceptance is coming now that CNN (even at 2nd and 3rd place in the ratings struggle) is adopting the platform. This could have been mistaken for a one off fling with art, as it began last year with the 9/11 Ripple show to mark the tenth anniversary of the attack on the World Trade Centers.,However, , has decided to keep alive their tradition of spectacle and gimmickry with a presidential election , themed around power. A tempestuous subject that deserves examination. Just don’t read the comment section if you , were any sort of idealist when you arrived.,Seb Jarnot’s piece, “War of the Smiles” is a very precise piece when coupled with the statement and brings to mind a passage from Chuck Klostermann’s book “,” in which he , the three types of American laughs. Seb Jarnot’s piece also seems to be the populist candidate in the comment section.,Back to you William Powhida, from one white male to another, congratulations. On a related tangent: It’s amazing how much your rendering of George Bush’s head looks like Newt Gingrich’s melon, or vice versa.,[,], ,You never know who is your neighbor in Bushwick. The girl down the hall could easily be ,. You maybe said hi to her once when she was going to work. Maybe she was doing hair for Neon Hitch or that blond model Abbey Lee Kershaw that day. Because that’s what Chelsey Pickthorn does. She is a visionary colorist and a hair stylist. Oh, and she is starting her own studio on Wyckoff Ave in October., , is located at the storefront corner on Wyckoff Ave just one block down from Norte Maar. “We are having a grand opening on October 13. That’s a big to do item,” Chelsey says while sitting on a Victorian couch in her studio. The interior of the salon isn’t complete yet, but it’s clearly shaping up. A beautiful chandelier is Chelsey’s pride; distressed hardwood floors, subway-tilled walls, reclaimed wood features discreetly show Chelsey’s excellent taste., , ,Chelsey, only 28, explains that she has been working in the coloring industry for 10 years now. She is from Portland, Oregon, and moved to New York City, and most importantly to Bushwick, 4 years ago. “I really believe in this neighborhood,” she says. Chelsey has apprenticed under legendary Laurie Foley and worked in her L’Atelier de Laurie. She has mastered the painting technique, which is unlike regular coloring – it’s gentle on the hair and allows for a much more detailed and precise approach. Chelsey explains that hand painting is something completely different. The session takes about 6 hours, and the price is, as you can expect, in the higher range. “I have clients flying in from Texas for example,” says Chelsey. She is expecting clients from Manhattan, but is also very open to the clients from this neighborhood. Chelsey explains that Pickthorn is not a factory; she will have only three chairs. She dedicates a lot of attention to each client, trying to bewitch their hairstyle to match their personality, make their dreams come true and simply create “a better version of you.”, , , , , , ,[mappress mapid=""78""],An all-Bushwick wave of celebration followed the opening of ,. Just two weeks later, another store with used books popped out in our beloved pigeon town.  , is located on Flushing Ave and is run by the same book-loving folk as the atmospheric Book Thug Nation in Williamsburg. I’m tempted to say that good things come in pairs and so Bushwick, the former ,has turned into ,.,If you insist, I shall pronounce a comparison of these two places, but only because you insisted. Molasses is a place where you can hang out and spend some time reading a book while having a coffee or a beer. On the other hand, Human Relations is the go-to place if you need a specific book. From the floor to the ceiling, the shelves at Human Resources are filled with books., , , ,“We specialize in fiction,” says Cory Eastwood, the manager at Human Relations. But they have a lot more than that. Philosophy, Film, Noir, History, Art, Science, Science Fiction, Food, Drama and, most interestingly, Foreign Language. Cory says they particularly want to develop the Spanish section because of the large number of Spanish speaking Bushwick residents. But they also have other languages like French, Russian, German and who knows what else. In addition to selling, the bookstore is also buying books, so feel free to drop by with your interesting titles for sale.,Cory says they also want to have readings at Human Relations. The first author invited to read is the infamous Q.R. Markham aka Quentin Rowan, the author of ,. The novel was so good that Marham got a book deal for two sequels and a movie was to be shot. Unfortunately for him, it was discovered that , is essentially a mash up of 13 other spy novels. Public humiliation followed, as you can imagine. Q.R. Markham recently wrote an autobiography about his life as an outcast plagiarizer. (Hopefully he didn’t plagiarize that one too!) He will read from the autobiography at Human Resources in fall. Follow Bushwick Daily for details of this reading.,Also, toss your Kindle in the trash…books are back., , , , , ,[mappress mapid=""77""], ,Keep scrolling. Keep scrolling. You’re not at the end yet, are you? Yes, that’s the , that was just recently announced by The Well. About 80 kinds of beers (for starters) from across the country and from abroad will be served at this new tremendous venue over at Meserole Street. The Well/The Wick is very likely , to the neighborhood this summer. This enormous beer hall and a music venue opened its doors for the first time in July, just to give us a little flavor of things to come. Awesome concert in their industrial yard  featuring star rapper Cam’ron was just a little pre-opening because we still were not able to see inside of The Well… And hell, we are curious… The venue still doesn’t have the official opening date, but we suspect it will be soon…,To sooth our impatience, The Well is hosting ,. The headliner, British vocalist Peter Murphy used to be in bands such as Bau Haus or Dalis Car will assisted by amazing Crystal Stilts, Small Black and Airwaves.,Tickets go for $25 …or $80 if you want to get a backrub directly from Peter Murphy (ok, we don’t know about the backrub, but for sure you will be able to access to a meet & greet event with Peter Murphy after the show, a signed limited edition poster by artist Nat Damm and a copy of the Bauhaus CD “Go Away White” signed by Peter Murphy).,…OR two of you, lovely readers can win tickets for you and your date.,Here is how:,* ,;,* , (in case you don’t already) and post on our wall, ,. In addition to the backrub… (ehm).,The competition closes on Friday midnight, and the winners will be announced on our Facebook page on Saturday. So don’t make plans for Sunday afternoon, because you we will see you at The Well!!, , ,Bushwick is very well represented in the upcoming all-Brooklyn madness , (in case you’re the last person on Earth from Brooklyn not to know what is GO!Brookyn, it is an open studio walk and competition organized by Brooklyn Museum that will take place all around Brooklyn on September 8th and 9th, 11-7pm). Bushwick coordinators of Go! Brooklyn are inviting everyone to come to , tonight for an informational meet up of participating artists and voters. Yes, because everyone can vote for the best studio. This meeting will be pleasant also thanks to the local artists performing at the beginning and at the end of the meet up.,Music show bookers in Bushwick are certainly not taking a summer break. To the contrary, the bands are playing everywhere: on a roof, in a storage, in a backyard, in a loft and more!,Check out our 6 picks for this week:,Spice Hound Music Co. is releasing a CD! To celebrate this occasion they will play a show at a warehouse at 338 Moffat Street off Wilson L. They invited The Hybrid Movement Company acrobats, The End Men, Cave Days and The Sewing Machine War to help them entertain the crowd!,Is there anybody cooler than aerialists? Maybe really good magicians… Or decadent dancers. Either way, all of these performers will be providing for your decadent experience this Thursday at The House of Yes. Tix are 10 bucs a piece and are sold exclusively at the door., ,Yes, you’ve heard it from us, but REALLY… Go to Delinquency. The place is great, the bands are amazing, they have FREE BOOZE all night. Do I have to add anything else? All they are suggesting is a donation of $10.,A bunch of folks from 1085 Willoughby are inviting you to another show on their roof. They are starting at 5PM, and will be grilling, chilling, listening to bands (The Initials, Garage Sail) and enjoying some improv (Mike Green, Scott Townsend and Randy Riback, Pushups, Teen Demon). They are saying you should BYOB and BYOM (meat for grill), otherwise the event is free, organized simply for the love of roofs and fun!,Do you know the Cheap Storage building on Wyckoff Ave right off Jefferson L? Yes, that one. Go there and experience some storage awesomeness with Avan Lavan, Osekre and The Lucky Bastards, Gunfight!, Life Size Maps, Gypsy Wig and DJ Collective Wc Kids. Tix are $7 in advance or $10 at the door. The 60 minutes between 8PM and 9PM is fully dedicated to free beer drinking, so come early!,English rock singer Peter Murphy who used to be in bands such as Bau Haus or Dalis Car is coming to Bushwick. Yes. It is true. Come to The Well on Sunday at 5PM. $25 to let you in., is being wished to all the good folks who live off Knickerbocker M. The train station has just closed on Saturday, August 18 for extensive renovations, and will remain closed for ,. After Knickerbocker, Central M will follow the same repair destiny. So enjoy while it lasts, folks off Central M.,What exactly will be done? “At Knickerbocker Avenue and Central Avenue stations, workers will entirely reconstruct the control houses, refurbish the station agent booths, replace the street and platform stairs, install new windscreens, perform structural repairs, install new drainage systems and repair column bases,” ,. …and it might actually be a good thing as the train station steps are leaking, and generally everything is “,.”,[More on , and , web], ,“What is your biggest dream?” Maybe to the surprise of many, most of the Bushwick artists wouldn’t reply “international stardom” or “wealth,” but rather simply, “not having have to go to my day job, and living off my art.”, ,Three or so in the morning is not, perhaps, an ideal hour to stream full-length feature films online. At least that’s how I feel about films I want to watch attentively and in their entirety.,It also transitions from a more or less feature-length pilot episode to approximately 45-minute chunks. Quite useful for those threes in the mornings.,When I got to episode 7, anyway, “Catch and Release,” the very first moments had me hitting the pause button. For as the scene fades in, the geographic indication at the bottom reads:,BUSHWICK, NEW JERSEY,This, of course, didn’t seem to make much sense. So I looked it up. It doesn’t seem to make much sense to Google, either. And it’s not in any blunders or factoids on imdb or Netflix—not that I found at the time, at any rate. I did learn a thing or two, though, about a company called Bushwick Metals that has a plant in New Jersey. If you’re looking for punching or drilling equipment, or perhaps carbon steel beams or grating, I know just the 750,000-sf warehouse you might like to visit.,So the Jersey indication was probably just a mistake. The show’s writers should have Bell (if you watch, you know) fact-check such things from now on.,Mistake aside, the nonetheless enjoyable—perhaps even all-the-more enjoyable—episode goes on to feature a somewhat rogue ‘alpha’ character named Skylar who fabricates extraordinarily engineered contraptions out of an industrial adorned with graffiti. You know, DIY-tech-style. She has a number of tattoos and snazzy highlights. She has a bit of snark and anarchist leanings. She decries ‘the system’ while selling some of her wares to, well, ‘the system.’ Her processors and drones and other well-dreamt gizmos are really sweet, after all. We wouldn’t want them to get into the wrong hands!,Oh, and she meets one of her buyers at a Farmers’ Market in Brooklyn Heights. When they wrote that part into the script, might not they have reconsidered their placement of the ‘Wick in The Jerz?,Anyway, highly entertaining, this episode.,Give it a gander. Perhaps your building is in it. Or maybe your graffiti. Or that girl with highlights who used to live down the hall.,It’s at least one way to kill pre-dawn hours while waiting for the new season of ,.,On that note,","

"
A BIG high five to all the street art minded people in Bushwick! Bishop203 known for his ,, long beard and chill demeanor recently opened a street art boutique, or ,, what he lovingly calls his cute little shop , located at 143 Central Ave (corner Willoughby) in Bushwick.,We gladly accepted Bishop’s invitation to check out his impressive stock of spray paint and his walls, both indoor and outdoor, which are dedicated to street art.,Named as the opposition to high brow art, Low Brow Artique is both a (street) art gallery and a (street) art supply shop, which sounds like a great combination to us. One aspect of his business can support the other!, ,Low Brow carries the most beloved brands of spray paint at really favorable prices – Ironlak from $5.25, Black Montana for $6.25, and Gold Montana for $7.00. Sweet! Bishop203 also points out the Luquitex paints (both hard and soft body), canvases and wood panels. You can find gesso, sketch books and Krink. Soon you will also be able to find fun stuff made by artists such as jewelry in the store…, , ,Above the counter you can observe in fascination (as I did) a collection of “vintage” Krylon spray cans. Not for sale, naturally…,Bishop203’s gallery space isn’t big but it looks great. Low Brow’s current art show opened this past Saturday and it features collaborations of two artists per piece. Every show at Low Brow will be complemented by a mural painted by the artists in the show.  The mural is currently covered by awesome art by The Yok, Sheryo, See1, and Ski. However, this Saturday, August 18, our favorite street art collective Robots Will Kill is coming over and will be painting more stuff, which gives us a great opportunity to see some street art par excellence in the making…,Welcome to the neighborhood, Low Brow Artique., , , ,Last week we lost stylist/muse/fashion writer futurist extraordinaire, ,. Every generation loses someone pivotal that came before them; a film star, a thought leader, a president, a rock star, those denizens who made it before you and everyone else. They are not to be feared, but they are to be watched…closely. While alive and amongst the living it’s the craziest, most outrageous, vulnerable, and volatile artists that somehow get their points across. Points that burst the bubble, points that make people uncomfortable, and points that break silence. That’s what Bushwick is to me. Crazy, vulnerable, volatile and aching to burst. This neighborhood makes no one comfortable, and that’s the beauty of it.,Since moving to Bushwick in August of 2011, it has taken me awhile to get acclimated to the particular brand of creativity and chaos in the neighborhood.  Fast and cosmically, I was thrust into a lost boy/girl gang of manic, hardworking,,, collaborative, and ambitious individuals that have inspired me to write about them.  They have inspired me to break my own boundaries and veer away from my regular paths of creativity. As a singer, songwriter, beat-maker, and electronic musician, it’s too easy to always surround myself with other musicians. I risk over-specialization if that happens. It’s much healthier for me to challenge myself in writing, to surround myself with stylists, visual artists, poets, photographers, and Martians. These individuals are my muses, my inspirations, future friends, and co-conspirators. They orbit around me and make it possible for me to create sounds, atmospheres, and vocalize what the world is feeling and seeing through music. Oh, and I just simply want the world to know about them too., ,I went to , last weekend for the ,. The combination of local history and live bands is more fun than you might imagine. Or was that local history and beer? I forget. Anyway, this place has got some real appeal.,As a resident of Bushwick, I have become accustomed to the warehouses and garages of my neighbourhood’s industrial past. The vast stretches of concrete are punctuated with roller door garages and giant storage facilities. I mean this in the nicest possible way: Bushwick has about as much charm as a shipping container. I think I’ve been in need of some pastoral therapy lately because I’m not a New York native and my Astroturf backyard just isn’t cutting it. To my utter delight, when I rode along Flushing Ave looking for Onderdonk Farmhouse I found just that. A farmhouse. A bona fide house-on-the-prairie wet dream.,The house dates back to 1709 and has been used for some pretty varied purposes. The site has been scrap glass depository, a geranium nursery, and a shop that supplied machines to the Apollo space program. It is now a museum and occasionally hosts flea markets and music festivals.,And the ,? Well, after ongoing disputes, in 1769 a rock was placed on the property to officially mark the Brooklyn/Queens boarder. The boarder has since moved but the rock remains.,So that’s the history bit. Let’s talk festivities. There were bands playing from midday till almost midnight. Beers were generously priced at three bucks and dogs were welcome (my favourite part). In between sets there were rounds of limbo and a more obscure Dutch game called ‘Spike a Poope’, which involved inserting a nail into an empty beer bottle from a backwards-squatted position.,Hmmm. Maybe not one for the museum walls., , ,If you haven’t yet had the pleasure, I really recommend a trip to the Farmhouse. Either take a weekend tour (and catch the flea market) or wait till the next festival., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,Bizarre ethos, synthesizers, weird gadgets obtained via eBay, girls, UFOs, experimental process. Electronic band , is celebrating their freshly released album in all their Bushwick weirdness this , at ,. The night named after their album ,, will feature 4 other bands of a similar experimental mindset (Water Brain, Rarefaction, H.Honne Wells and Fall of Another Year).,You probably saw Paradise Club performing in ,, , or , last Thursday. The band is also preparing a collaboration with Jason Andrew and , on an installment of , series. Before we see Paradise Club in action, we used this opportunity to chat with the members of the band, Eric Trosko and Kiowa Hammons, about their creative process, their inspiration for the album, and mainly why cars on fire…, We have been making music together and with other people for a number of years now. There was just a point where it was just us two left and we decided to let machines do the work that would have been done by other members. This really freed things up and allowed us to engage in the kind of experimentation and discovery that we had always wanted to. This is when Paradise Club really came into being in the springtime of 2011., It felt like we were both struggling to incorporate more chaotic elements and performance art practices into the music we were making, and the decision to just start from scratch with a new name, line-up, and instrumentation really opened up the possibilities for a new sound. There can be a lot of clichés associated with branding a collaboration as a “band”—mostly associated with the celebritization of musical groups brought on by rock and pop, and that’s not where we wanted to go with this project. But I think we’ve sort of achieved a good balance between what essentially makes a “band”—which is people making music together, with trying to create something more bizarre and unique by bringing in the elements of more art based practices; such as performative actions, visual art, weird manifestos, etc…, while still incorporating a band ethos into the music. This helps to connect the sounds to people as somewhat structured songs with ideas, motifs, and emotions embedded in.,I like to think of bands as little mini-cults—a group of people who believe in certain ideas spend a concentrated amount of time building on said ideas and create different ways to express them, then the group start preaching these ideas to the people in the hopes that they’ll believe in them to. The interaction of ideas and energy grow into a collective unconscious, channeled through sounds, and then you have something., 2 synthesizers, 2 vocalists, 1 guitar, 1 saxophone., This is like trying to describe a mugger for a police sketch or something…so far I think we’ve kind of hidden behind naming the music and musicians that have influenced us rather than trying to put the actual sounds into words. I’d like to think of our music achieving a visceral effect similar to the distortion of sound when under water, or the audio physicality of a good nitrous oxide trip. Eric a while back just started calling it “Soft Skull”, I think it is good to have a new way to describe something new., ,: I don’t really have a favorite. I have the most experience with guitar but it really only plays a minor role at the moment. The Minimoog is really the backbone of our sound on this release. It is the starting point of everything we do. I am hoping to incorporate more instruments in the future.,: For me it’s the saxophone. I find that the tone of the instrument can both blend in with the atonal nuances as well as punctuate the more chaotic noises of the music in interesting ways. Plus I enjoy the physical challenge of the instrument; particularly its connection to human breath. There reaches a point with these songs that I feel like I’m going to pass out, and that’s when I know that we are playing at our best., It is the best results of our experimental process. We wanted to entertain ideas that are largely out of favor and fit them into the form of a pop song. Basically most of the music we hear today sounds like it is made for pussies; we are inspired by our opposition to this. The pop song format with all its convention is still the best way to advance the anti-pussy agenda. We try to keep it real and tactile. Real sound, real pain, real joy, real love, real dreams, no pussies…, The album is sort of a layer cake of different noises and atonal drones stacked and blended together to make something akin to a song. Sort of like looking at a cartoon rendition of the earth’s soil: you have the inner and outer cores, the mantle and the crust, with some dinosaur fossils, oil, and dirt; all crushed and fused together—now just think of this diagram as an audio experience…Lyrically, we tend to write songs about what we know: girls, political strife, and UFO’s.,There wasn’t any one particular thing that influenced the making of the album, beyond just coming to a point where we had been playing these songs awhile, and the order of the songs fit, so it was like “when are we going to record this stuff?” Plus we were able to work with our friend and master sound guru, Lou Sherman, so the pieces just fell into place., ,: No matter what I am making it is always the same approach. Musical sound is just another material to work with. What I like about working with musical sound is it exists in time, space, and can even be felt, yet it remains invisible. I think of our songs more as places that can be visited rater that something to just listen to. I like the collaboration of music rather than just toiling away alone in an art studio.,:  Looking at music and being in a band as more of an artistic project, similar to creating a painting or sculpture but with sounds, seemed like a better outlook to produce the music that we were trying to create.,: We are a Bushwick band. These streets with their once desolate warehouses and factory canyons and its whore-lined streets are our inspiration. 12 years ago burning cars were as common as overpriced cafes are now. “Soundtrack to a Car on Fire” is a fairy tale of an apocalypse long past.,: When a car burns it takes some time as the metal slowly melts and its flammable guts ignite. In my mind’s eye I can picture the act of a car (or any object for that matter) burning with a certain rhythm pattern; with the sight of the flames flickering and the thing itself slowly smoldering… creating a sort of visual opera. Our music has that kind of beat to it—long intervals of entropic destruction leading to a dead simmer and stillness—leaving only junk and ash and fumes for someone to sweep up.,[mappress mapid=""75""],Being from Florida, I’m often asked to explain what grits are. This happens enough that it is a cliché, but it’s a very real cliché. My explanation is generally followed by a puzzled look that appears to ask “Why would someone eat that?”,To be fair, grits are ground corn that is boiled, served very hot and generally with eggs in the morning.,Now I can just point my curious foodie friends to Mama Joy’s and tell them to order the Shrimp and Grits or the Beef Cheek., ,Lazy, lazy are the dog days of summer. All an average Bushwick person wants to do is to ride a bike through the sprinklers. In Bushwick, we report less events than on very productive weeks but this week’s events are truly awesome, which in the end is an equation we like. Here is what you should not miss!,Here at Bushwick Daily, we are really proud because we are helping to put up some really weird experimental electronic bands. It started with Paradise Club, a band of Eric Trosko and Kiowa Hammons, who just recently released their debut album titled ,(note: we love the name among other things). So we were like, hey why don’t we do a release party, and Paradise Club were like hey, why don’t we invite more bands. This Thursday, at 8pm the madness starts at Brooklyn Fire Proof. The admission is free (sweet), and additionally you will see Water Brain, Rarefaction, H.Home Wells, Fall of Another Year. This entire electronic craziness will be accompanied by trippy video projection by visual artist Lars Rasmussen. See ya all there on Thursday!, ,Another great event to be held at Brooklyn Fire Proof this week is (most likely) the greatest Bushwick reading series curated by Mike Lala and Eric Nelson, Fireside Follies! Fireside Follies has had a great summer run, and this Friday will be hitting its finale, so don’t miss it. You can look forward to awesome readers Robert Tumas, Chiwan Choi (Abductions), Kendra Grant Malone (Everything is Quiet) and Dan Magers (Partyknife)., ,Music in the courtyard, films in Bushwick Community Darkroom and, above all, 25 vendors and 13 shops to provide you with fresh produce and flea items ,  The event is organized by Bunna Cafe, Bushwick vegan pop up Ethiopian restaurant (yum)!, ,Sardine is one of the most lovable shops/galleries in Bushwick. Run by Lacey Fekishazy, Sardine carries a bunch of super cute jewelry and other accessories made by Brooklyn artists.  Additionally, we love their gallery! This Wednesday, Sardine will open a solo show of Gabriel Hurier titled ,. Swing by and say hi to this friendly folk., ,Presentation Party Night is one of the nicest events we have in Bushwick. The evening consists of 6 short presentations and Q&A on any topic followed by free beer and food while it lasts. This time the presenters will talk about Aesthetics, L Train History (we wanna know!!), Cider (hmmm), Self-Confidence (needed), History of Riddles, PPN Past, Present, and Future! The best news is that PPN is celebrating 2 years this month! Congratulations and happy birthday to everybody involved, and keep up the good work!!,Like any freelancer, I’ve spilled coffee into my keyboard upon being bumped by an excited grad student in a crowded café. This kind of encounter has made me hate The Arcade Fire at times, usually because the excitement is borne out hearing “Wake Up” for the 10,000th time. I want to say “I know that you love this album! So do I and everyone else we could possibly know!”,I met Cody Sullivan and Natalie Chan after an Arts in Bushwick meeting at their clubhouse for freelancers called ,. Bat Haus is a co-working space for people who don’t have an office or studio and are in need a more professional setting than the usual café or bar scene that freelancers generally populate.,After a quick conversation I learned that Natalie studied philosophy of the mind biology in Austin, Texas. She then moved to New York and studied fine art at SVA. Cody studied analytical philosophy and English Literature in Rhode Island. Then I turned on the recorder:, That’s why we hit it off. Asking, “Did you study Kant or…” [laughs]., We both grew disillusioned with philosophy for similar reasons, lack of employment in the field, having a change of heart.,My main passion is writing fiction. But for work I do copywriting and I had a friend who helped me get a fulltime job in New York copy writing. Then some friends started a clothing company, I did some work for them.,Unfortunately, the company went under and I started doing freelance work. That’s when I got a taste for what it’s like to not have an office or a community of people anymore. I did the café culture, which is great in a way but it’s very unpredictable. Also, if you take yourself seriously as a freelancer, getting work done in a café is tough. There are a lot of distractions, the other thing is, especially in Williamsburg and this area, I’ve gone to four cafés in a row and they’re all filled up. By then you’ve wasted one to two hours of your time. If you do that every day it becomes exhausting., He’d come home and say “I can’t do this anymore.” One day I said, “Let’s do something about it.”,So we did a lot of research and found out about the co-working movement. There’s a lot of support for it, from different cities and they have regular meetings. We went to some and it seemed like a great idea.,I walked down this street (Starr Street) every day to take the subway to work and would look at this building. One day it was open and I looked inside, I thought it was pretty cool.,I used Loopnet, an application for commercial listings and found out that there was one space open on this street. It turned out to be this one, the one that I looked at first.,So we met with the broker and set about securing the space. We almost lost it. We were so upset, wondering who put the deposit down before us. But it turned out that the landlord was more interested in what we wanted to do with it, since we weren’t putting in a restaurant or a bar there would be less things to convert back once the lease was up., We jumped on this really fast too. So we aren’t coming into this with our community already formed or anything., We like that though, we wanted the community to form organically via word-of-mouth.,Cody has a writer’s meetup on Wednesdays called Write the Night for example. It’s a good chance for people to form an idea of what this space can be. The people coming to the writer’s meetup don’t necessarily have to be members but they can see what it’s like and meet people who do work here.,It’s a very different feeling than working from home, which we used to do. We have roommates so we know how hard it is to set up a corner office. Or to get work done when the cat jumps in your lap and the kitchen is so close and there’s always a good time to take a nap [laughs]., If you need that moment of professionalism we have the conference room. Most freelancers can’t bring a client back to their apartment., My friend is a freelance photographer. Try saying to someone, “Hey do you want to come back to my apartment to shoot?” Well no.,I want to offer people a second home base with more professionalism and more support.,[smiling] And we have barbecues., ,[mappress mapid=""74""],Did you know that there is an amazing urban farm on the roof of the , complex in the middle of the industrial jungle on Ingraham Street? It’s called ,, and tonight you can check it out, get a tour, have a lot of fun while at it and help out a good cause., is a benefit to to help raise funds for a youth empowerment initiative of ,. EcoStation:NY, dear friends, is a non-profit organization behind , (yaay!), , (wohoo!), and most importantly for tonight, behind the Farm in the Sky on top of Brooklyn Fire Proof.,A donation of $10 will get you (besides a good feeling, naturally) Beekeeping 101 workshops and tours of Farm-in-the-Sky, live reggae band Radical Revolution, a Night Market (a mini Bushwick Farmers’ Market), an open-air jam session (musicians welcome!), a photo exhibit by Katarzyna Gawin, and Farm-in-the-Sky-inspired food and drink specials by Chef Marie Tribouilloy and local mixologists.,Come early because the fun starts at 7pm already!

(Also note, dear reader, that whichever of these events you decide to attend, nothing is better than Bushwick life’s serendipity. Like yesterday, I was biking down St. Nicholas and what did I see? A dude taking out his two dogs and a giant yellow snake. You probably saw the picture on our , yesterday but it’s hard not to repost, as you can imagine. I am declaring this encounter the craziest event in Bushwick this week!),We are not hiding that we are , about new music venue in Bushwick, Deliquency. But what’s even better is that Deliquency is not officially open, and yet they throw a preview party here and there. This Saturday they are having cool bands performing (Chappo, Terror Pigeon Dance Revolt, Alaskas, It Is Rain In My Face) and free bourbon and vodka all night long. I mean is there a better deal for $8 suggested to get in?,The fabulous new , music venue The Well is hosting its second show this Saturday. Unlike Deliquency’s show, The Well’s event is not a cheap one, but you’re paying for high-end fun with the best of the best in the music world. Slaughterhouse, Freeway, Pharoahe Monch, DJ Soul and a beautiful view over industrial Bushwick will cost you $25.,Bushwick welcomed Molasses Books, the first bookstore in Bushwick with ,! Now the celebration continues because the owners of Book Thug Nation in Willyburg are opening a Bushwick outpost at Flushing Ave. And they will be celebrating the whole day on Saturday. Stop by and have fun!,Cassius Fouler is a really cool artist, and if you missed his show at Weldon Arts, a new Bushwick gallery on Irving Ave, you should definitely drop by this Saturday. If you didn’t miss it, drop by anyways - they are serving complimentary cocktails!, is a very nice, small group show featuring Judith Braun, Antonia Perez, and Hilda Shen. As is a very good tradition at Parallel Art Space, they close their shows with a promise of a little food, which is always nice. We’ll be there!, , ,If you went to the opening reception for ,last Thursday, you probably didn’t know that it was the last show you would attend at , Bushwick for some time. Yes, it is true. Christina Ray confirmed yesterday that Kesting/Ray Bushwick is going on hiatus starting in September.  ","

"If herbs and flowers in gritty industrial Bushwick are a contradiction, then finding an herbal apothecary off Morgan L stop may feel like a little miracle. Gentle herbalist Anit Hora founded , from her apartment, and since then has created a beautiful line of handmade herbal products. She sells them on her ,, in an , and in several shops in Brooklyn (in Bushwick it’s Loom Yoga and Better Than Jam)., ,There are two things about , that stand out especially upon the first visit:,One of which is how non-descript the outside is. There is a folding sign placed out on the street, a recessed entrance, and two chairs on either side of an ashcan with a stag on it., ,Bushwick can easily be proclaimed the fashion capital of Brooklyn, and so it’s not a surprise that Bushwick has decided to have it very own fashion weekend. Bushwick Fashion Weekend will be held on September 22, (the following weekend of the Williamsburg Fashion Weekend) with hopes that it will be extended into a two day event. And now the great news! Designers, performers, models, and artists are needed for this event.,To participate as one of the aforementioned you have to submit five of your best pieces by ,. The $10 admission fee is a donation to maintaining the gallery.,Bushwick fashion weekend is the brainchild of local artist Nyssa Frank, owner of the , Nyssa doesn’t want this fashion weekend to compete with the one held in Williamsburg, but instead display unity of the local artists by having all galleries and local shops work together to make this weekend spectacular. Her vision is not to have a frou-frou Soho-esque fashion week, but have Bushwick’s nitty-gritty, beautiful take on fashion week displaying all things that can be converted in art or vice-versa.,As of now, the fashion shows will be held in Living Gallery studio where jewelry can become art installations and dancers will be serenading the crowd throughout the festivities. Designers should feel free to come dressed in costume, or as themselves.,If more amazing artists decide to sign up for Fashion Weekend, you will be given the opportunity to join a tentative parade commencing from the Morgan Ave train station (or the Jefferson St. Train Station!) concluding at the gallery where all the local designers are able to exhibit their creations for the whole neighborhood to see., ,Please join this , local, creative minds. Display unity, and have fun.,Last Saturday, aka the  Bushwick day to end all Bushwick days (,,,), ,also partied hard, hosting an awesome line-up of bands curated by ,. Though the , is brand spanking new and not officially open for business, they are ,, including one upcoming awesome lineup with , and , (both bands we love, and have posted about) on August 24th.,We’ve all heard of ,who throw the raddest parties in Bushwick, but what is ,, you ask? According to their website, the organization “Is a new archive that tracks and profiles rising bands in Brooklyn and beyond. The Aputumpu blog/events/showcases/festivals will feature and celebrate the work of rising bands who are on the verge of greatness.” Pretty apt description; their website acts as a straightforward blog and music shoveler, bringing hot new bands based in Brooklyn and beyond to the surface of the sometimes unreadable, overhyped music-blog scene.  They host occasional showcases around the city and  at venues like , Bushwick. They also did a very, in March spanning across different venues, featuring the likes of band ,, ,, and the ,. Awesome! Founder Osekre (below) was onhand and very enthusiastic.,This Aputumpu was a , and featured an all day slew of awesome under-the-radar bands, featuring ,, ,, ,,,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,. And Delinquency hosted it all in great style, proving to be just as special a space as we thought it would be. It was absolutely packed, full of happy and friendly people, cohabitating happily with great music and the good energy of the space.,We’ll catch you at , at ,in Bushwick August 25th with an open bar. We’ll keep you posted with details!,The following shows are closing soon, so you should seek them out this weekend.,and , are both at StorefrontBushwick for one final weekend. The main exhibition space is hosting ,, the curation of which is as collage-informed as many of the artworks in the show. There are many highlights to this show, a particular joy are ,‘s incredibly detailed paintings reminiscent of felled trees with rings to be counted. Extra points go to the clever positioning of ,‘s mylar piece, visible from the street and seemingly reductive, go inside and walk around it to fully appreciate its conversation-starting draw.,In the project room is another show entitled ,. This features works by Julie Torres. I found this show particularly interesting, having seen many individual works in the past, she strikes me as a “passion painter.” This body of work is startlingly reflective. Some pieces look like portraits of an ocean floor.,There’s only one weekend left to see , and , and the artist Julie Torres will be there on Sunday, August 5, 2012 from 3-6PM. On view at ,, 16 Wilson Avenue. Gallery hours 1-6PM,This may be one of the most uplifting shows I’ve seen in Bushwick. Not only is the installation a springboard for connection but it’s smart and every individual piece adds to it. The entire installation is a maze with treasure chests, love potions, maps projected on the walls, and multicolored lights that one can control from the edges of the maze. It seems that nothing is off limits and when someone new comes into the maze, the installation fosters conversation between the strangers.,I met Venus Barbaro inside the maze, who described the treasure chests as being like wishing ponds. There’s something about talking to someone with those strings between you and them.,I really can’t say enough good things about this installation. So swing by , at 389 Melrose  Street. Free between 2-8PM on Thursday through Sunday and $10 for events, being some friends and make new ones.,The second opening of a summer spanning art exhibition. We haven’t seen this iteration yet so we don’t have any photos, but we expect their trademark wink to conceptual art to be prevalent in the curation., is usually an artistic oasis during the summer doldrums. I hope the lemonade is spiked.,Be sure to check out the opening tonight from 7-9PM in the basement of 56 Bogart Street.,You’re walking down Flushing Avenue. The factories surround you, the road is busy, the heavy traffic of trucks and cars makes you want to explode. Additionally, the sun is frying your brain, and the sweat is dripping from your face. You keep on walking and walking. The only thing you wish for is an oasis to appear out of nowhere. A little white farmhouse surrounded by a green meadow…  And wait a minute, suddenly an 18th century Dutch farm manifests right in front of you. No, this is not a lucid dream. This is reality, and you just came across , on the border of Brooklyn and Queens. In fact, the rock to mark the border is right there in the garden of Onderdonk House. So called ,.,Arbitration Rock Festival borrowed its name from it, and will very likely be one of the nicest events of the summer in the area. The large green meadow surrounding this magical building is perfect for summer gatherings, which get exponentially better once you add really good music, beer, food and great people. The headliner of the festival is a cult Bushwick band Pass Kontrol that actually rehearses in the attic and the Farmhouse has a very special meaning for them. So we are expecting nothing less than a really amazing performance from them. Other bands that we can’t wait to see include Not Blood Paint, Backwards or Springs.,Here is the full line up:,10pm – ,9pm – ,8pm – ,7pm – ,6pm – ,5pm -,4pm – ,3pm – ,2pm - ,1pm – ,
12pm – doors open, ,We’ve all seen , in The Metropolitan Museum of Art, MoMA, and other major museums. Is this a gag? A stunt? Is he the shock jock of street art? Perhaps. But one question he is asking loudly and clearly is, who’s to dub one work museum worthy and one not?,A major criticism in the art world will always be the commercialization of galleries. To the frustration of many talented up and coming artists, these large quiet spaces often come under fire for catering to the wealthy, specifically showing what’s “trendy” over what’s “good,” or art they think might fit in a loft in TriBeCa. What if these bounds were broken, and there was no emphasis on how “good” an artist is based on where their work is shown. What if all types of artists could have shows in notable places? What if you could hang your artwork at next to Van Gogh’s “Starry Night” at MOMA, in the trees at Central Park, or even in the Roman Colosseum? Bushwick based ,may have found a way.,When you think “augmented reality” it’s easy to picture holograms of Michael Jackson and Marilyn Monroe singing next to this year’s American Idol winner. But Skwarek has been exploring how the medium can change the way we think about art since the 1990s. By working with artists who are willing to submit their work to basically, thin air — Skwarek creates art galleries that exist in virtual space. By searching “BOS” on site in a , in specific parts of the city, a viewer can see works that he has specifically placed, in the sky, hanging on buildings, in different venues, etc.,“Back then it was very difficult to do, it wasn’t mobile,” he said, describing huge goggles and backpacks worn by people who wanted to participate in an augmented gallery visit in the 90s. “We developed our own app when the mobile revolution happened, and once it was in everyone’s pocket, all of the artists started jumping on board. It was a major shift.”,So if you’re still wondering about how to get your painting in MoMA, Skwarek spoke about one of his first major and successful exhibitions, an ,created in collaboration with ,. In 2010, he invited the hundreds of people that walk through the museum every day to view new art work in a new way. A disclaimer on the site reads “PS The MoMA is not involved yet.”,“We said [to artists] if you want to send us your artwork, we’ll make a show, we’ll put your work in MoMA, you’ll ,. What came out of that show was not so much about the DIY element, but it was about breaking and questioning the boundaries of one of the most prestigious institutions and the entire gallery system.” ,to viewing art in such a prestigious and traditional institution.,It’s clear that the possibilities for a relationship with augmented reality and traditional art are just about endless. “We’ve put stuff in the White House, we’ve put stuff at the Korean DMZ, I’ve put stuff at the Palestinian Israeli separation barrier. Recently we just removed all of the parthenon marbles from the British museum and returned them to Greece. It has a lot of freedom and you can do big things,” Skwarek reiterated.,But the one place on earth that has possibly the highest concentration of art in augmented reality? Bushwick. Bushwick appears to be a playground and an experimental space for Skwarek and his friends, and one of the most supportive communities for this type of work. Because it seems so steeped in technology, it does beg the question: Should this be classified as art?,“There are some people who are going to be hard to win over, but what’s happening is a shift in the understanding of the virtual and physical space, and it’s happening with the younger generation. The younger generation is starting to understand it because it grew up online, it grew up in the virtual space and it understands this experience as real.”,In addition to both playing with the laws of physics, and challenging the boundaries of art institutions, the project encourages people to get up and get out. While most art and technology platforms make it easier for viewers to never have to actually go to Paris to see the Louvre, (ahem, Google Art Project), one needs to physically be in these spaces to see the work.,The art world will always be in contempt about technology “invading” “traditional” forms of art. But one thing that can’t be argued with is Skwarek’s work in Bushwick is that makes the art world more accessible for artists and art lovers alike, knocking down the barriers that stand in the way of bringing all types of great art to people all over the world.,Welcome, dear August. You emerged at our doors requesting a cup of warm beverage because “It’s raining cats and dogs out there.” Oh well, there there, August. Here is a coffee, but beware, it’s little bit bitter, as something’s telling me that summer is going down the hill from your arrival…. Despite or maybe because of that we have some awesome art shows going on in the neighborhood this week. From experimental video to recycled sculpture and roof festivities, here is what we recommend:, ,The “little hangar”- how , called the , of SoHo-based , on Boerum Street, is hosting its second art show. Kesting/Ray is promising an exceptional group show featuring  four MFA graduates from University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Mark Farris, Hannah Holshouser, Paul Howe, Gabriel Serpa, and Harry Swartz-Turfle., ,On Thursday night you have a unique chance to see the entire Season 4, that is 11 episodes of ,. Acid Rain is a cable access/web show of Jerstin Crosby who on a monthly basis (co)curates innovative video and film works by emerging artists. According to Jerstin, Season 4 in particular was acutely dark, brooding just below the surface, in ways that were often surprising, ambitious, and humorous. Let’s see it!, ,AIRPLANE, a friendly gallery run out of a basement on Jefferson Street is opening a lovely summer art show this Saturday. Curated by excellent Rico Gatson, Grounded, is both indoor and outdoor sculpture group show.  Found, recycled and other ‘humble’ material is the medium, and we are excited to see some 3D Bushwick works., ,Do my eyes see a proper Bushwick apartment art happening? It seems so. Furthermore, ,sounds , summerly, it makes me want to run in the ocean, and send August on a break…. At Heavy Refuge, or 77 Irving Ave. #1R, you will see a big group art show (featuring among others excellent Dave Bates, Iris Jaffe, Lindsay Dye, Brent Owens, Adam Parker-Smith, or William Powhida), and you will hear Savage Severe playing records. At 9pm Joseph Bradshaw and Jamie Townsend will read. And here is a big surprise! ,, recently hyper-popular amazing musician will perform at 10pm., ,The following statement never gets old: There’s a new bar in town. In this case, the town is Bushwick and the bar is Mazelle.,It has been open to the public for about three months and my impression, when I dropped by recently, was that it has hit the ground running.  ,A few weeks ago, my music blogger friends approached me about hosting an electronic music showcase in my backyard on Troutman street. The show was proposed and put together by Brooklyn-based blog ,, LA-and-Chicago-based record label and music collective ,, and Eric from one of the featured bands, ,. My roommates and I liked the idea but hesitated at first considering the unpredictable nature of house shows, but that was before we saw how passionate these DIY bloggers were about the artists performing.,My first concern was noise, but then I remembered- We live in ,. The town that hosts rooftop shows on an almost-nightly basis, where you’ll hear the same reggaeton beat pounding from cars across the area for hours at a time, where music venues blossom in storage venues, where even the fried chicken store on the corner blasts mariachi. This neighborhood radiates music- with a latina culture built on music, a haven for indie artists, experimental musicians, and DIY party-throwers- why shouldn’t we host that energy for one night? Our contribution to the noise of the ‘hood for one early evening showcase was made up of tight, mellow, intricately understated electronic music was a drop in the bucket. Turns out not even our (strict) super complained about the music and our kid neighbors (who happen to be little girls) watched the show from their fire escape and giggled the whole time.,Despite rumors of rain and worries for a muddy yard, the show went without a hitch. Our backyard is a huge space and we do our best using it for parties and bbqs, but it has challenged us at times with mud, neighborhood cats, crazy-looking bulbous weeds, and failed attempts at gardening. When I re-entered my backyard, and it was a completely different place- projections sprawled across a sheet, music equipment crowded our dining table, a huge tv flashing colorful graphics, candles kindling the good vibes. The fantastic, kaleidoscopic live projections came on behalf of ,, who was in from Chicago for the event. The assortment of musicians and otherwise creatives filled the space ate hot dogs and met eachother, joining in a random backyard at 8 pm on a thursday night to see live music by word of online blogging.,The show started with a set from ,, an electronic artist from Ann Arbor who often graces the city with his mystically charismatic style. Playful and pulsing, vocals chorally bouncing from speaker to speaker, his songs seem to emit a rainbow of sound. His set transitioned into that of ,, a Brooklyn glitchy-hop musician who remixes vocals to looping, wordless patterns, and creates houses of mathy beats to rest melodies atop.  A type of abstract, feeling-evocative sound/dance music, it was lovely.,(or, ,, when joined by others), who has been haunting NYC with his drippy synth silk for a while now, took the yard next. Featuring Eric, who does petal magic and croones in his lo-fi way and Nadia Hulett (who we previously ,), joining him to food the songs with soaring vocals, shaking up the sleepiness that lives in their chillwavey beats. Fantastic.,Lastly, ,, strange name but incredible music from a one-man-band. A truly beautiful sound, with a archaic voice that sounds like it belongs in 90s alternative rock, accompanied by faithful full-bodied guitar and vocal melodies on a bed of electronic flourishes. Strangely otherwordly and superbly nostalgic, perfect way to end the showcase.,An incredible event with sweet music and a great turnout- the vision of Dave of,, Elouise and Tyler of , and Eric of ,executed beautifully in my own backyard- a space I’d never imagined would suit a music showcase so well.  But, hosting such a successful and awe-inspiring event was an eye-opener. This is the land of in-house galleries and apartments that double as music venues. If you want to get involved with Bushwick’s creative scene it’s easy to find events happening every night, it’s fun to find others to collaborate with. If someone wants to responsibly borrow your backyard/rooftop/front stoop for a night to fullfil their creative vision, say ,! I guarantee you’ll end up inspired yourself.,More photos here:","

"The only way to make it through this weekend was with a flask and a water bottle. It began long before it officially began, but debauchery is not the point so let’s start at ,.,It was a muggy Friday evening and two bands whom I really enjoy were playing along with another that a friend suggested. I showed up pretty late, enough time to catch the end of ,’ stoner-friendly set. Sweat beading on everyone while the lead guitarist lunged his way out of a sloppy guitar solo swamp of his own creation. The keyboardist was exchanging looks with everyone including the bouncy bass player as those notes became less and less streamlined and more out of tune. They concluded on two slash-and-burn guitar strokes.  , ,In Bushwick you are likely to see ,; you can easily buy some , or the most ,. Don’t let us even get started on , and ,. We have plenty! But on this lovely island of creativity called Bushwick, one important thing was missing…books! Until about last week, you had to take a train to Bedford to go to a bookstore. How crazy!,Luckily, the neighborhood full of passionate writers and readers alike just got its first bookstore. Furthermore, Molasses Books is in the very best Bushwick tradition, not just another boring bookstore., ,Molasses Books opened last week. I biked over on Friday, super curious and excited to chat with the owner Matthew Winn. “I used to sell books on the street,” said Matthew smiling and proudly leaning over the bar at his fresh new space. “At some point I realized I have so many books, I might as well open a bookstore.” Matthew found a perfects spot, a storefront on quiet Hart Street, right on the corner with busy Knickerbocker, and got to work. The result of his endeavor is a beautiful and cozy bookshop, with pristine white walls, wooden shelves full of books and a couple of tables and spots welcoming you to read. “This side is fiction, that side is non-fiction,” Matthew pointed first to the right and then to the left. “And we also have a poetry arch.” The selection of books has been curated by Matthew himself who is also looking forward to buy books from Bushwick locals, and create a really unique pool of great literature., ,However, the first thing you notice when you step into the space is a long bar. Matthew was brewing coffee and preparing ice tea for the weekend behind the bar. “I want this to be a place where you can come, read and have drink,” he said. For the time being, Matthew is only serving soft drinks but once the necessary license arrives he is looking to serve beer and wine, and maybe even whiskey. As Matthew explained he doesn’t want Molasses to just be a coffee shop; he understands that good reading might require a good drink., ,Matthew is looking forward to host readings, book clubs and other events.,Molasses Books (770 Hart St) is open daily from 8am to 8pm (except Mondays when they close at noon). Matthew is working at the store himself for the moment, so swing by, have a coffee and a read, and enjoy this lovely place. You can like them on ,., ,[mappress mapid=""68""], ,Are you a musician? Then you should have your instrument and a few clothes. At best, you need about four changes of shirts, two changes of pants and some shorts for the summer.,Apply this liberally to whatever your trade is and you’re golden.,In general, it’s a sound practice to periodically get rid of at least half of your things.,You have to eat and the chances are good that the freelance work has dried up (especially in the summer). Luckily, sleeping in a park, the hostel or on Coney Island are generally nice this time of year. Unluckily, hot dog stands are one dollar, Ramen is thirty-nine cents, and both have the same amount of nutritional value: Which is ,.,Food stamps are a good way to reacquaint ones self with Granny Smith Apples and can be redeemed at ,.,Ikea bags are worth their weight in platinum. Nearly anything can fit, from kitchen to art supplies, blankets, pillows, loosely folded suits, tools, Persian rugs… Use your imagination and then store your imagination in your Ikea bag.,Quarters are the go-to coin currency. Hoard them for emergency phone calls (25¢ for local calls), laundry, and Metrocards.,This is practice for official ,. However, until you get into the swing of washing all of the dishes in an apartment, practice with friends. They may buy you a drink and listen to the first week woes of being homeless. But wash the dishes.,The other important facet to couch surfing is a graceful exit, so don’t overstay your welcome.,However, if you find yourself with no money and no place to sleep. Take the late night/early morning A Train back and forth through Brooklyn. With the long interludes between stops, it’s Brooklyn’s most sleepable train.,The Wyckoff Heights Hospital, for all of its faults, runs a great program in a house on Stanhope and Wyckoff (342 Stanhope Street, next to a small coffee shop). This place can help you along with obtaining a little aid in your time of need. In addition the friendly staff will listen to you without judgment. Afterwards they will provide you with a huge list of resources to help yourself.,Before court proceedings even take place, one can sometimes get an audience with the lawyers at the Bushwick-Ridgewood Senior Citizens Council on Wyckoff Avenue. This is a free service, though they are admittedly unfamiliar with the loft law, for that, you’ll have to go to another office on Wyckoff Avenue.,Look, it’s kind of a pain in the ass to figure out and the same goes for explaining it. So just walk down Wyckoff and look for their signs.,This is your life. It’s going to be a mix of tragedy and comedy. Making up songs while walking from one place to the next gets you through the day.,Jump in the fire hydrant spray. Do that even if you haven’t been evicted. You have to stay cool out there.,This is an option. Just saying.,At the heart of it, eviction isn’t the worst thing that can happen. It’s only another adventure,Bushwick is one of the friendliest neighborhoods in New York. People are warm, friendly and talkative. This is a portrait series taken in Bushwick streets on this past Sunday afternoon.,(You can also follow our , for more photos every day.), ,Don’t get me wrong, I love Mr. Softee, but chasing an ice cream truck in this heat can be tiring. Luckily, there are two awesome old timey ice cream spots that, in addition to serving delicious Italian gelato, don’t move from place to place. Rudy’s Bakery in Ridgewood and Circo’s Pastry Shop in Bushwick are your summer ice cream destinations!,Rudy’s Bakery has been in the neighborhood for 78 years now, and is managed by Tony and his family for over 30 years now. This cute old timey bakery remembers generations of delighted faces after biting into its sweet cupcakes and cookies. In the summer, you will especially appreciate Rudy’s gelato craftsmanship. , Cannoli., , ,The look at the , has to warm one’s heart. There are SO many great events this week! I am glad I can tell you already on Wednesday to save your energy for Saturday because a lucky coincidence has it that there are at least six fantastic events that ought to be attended and enjoyed by all the Bushwickians! We will party in the streets, drink lotsa beer, listen to good music and meet many great people. Who knows, maybe we will even party naked…,MANY cases of sleepless nights have been reported in Bushwick since we published , of new DIY music venue, Deliquency. Yes, we want to go as badly as you. This Saturday, Deliquency is opening their doors for the first time to the public, already at 3pm with a super-fun line up of bands (Grand Rapids, The Yellow Dogs, Dust Engineers, Lost Boy?, Murals, Roadside Graves, Bambara, Gunfight!, Osekre & The Lucky Bastards, Red Bedlam. Additionally, Brooklyn Brewery sponsored two open bar sessions – at 3-5pm and 9-11pm! The event is donation-based ($10 advance/ $12 door is a suggested donation).,Of course you can’t miss Roberta’s Block Party. There will be concerts (Your Youth, Iyez, Naam, Soft Spot, Gang Signs, Wild Yaks, MC Todd Experience, Heems from Das Racist, headliner Andrew W.K & more), delicious food,  Tiki Disco, free suspicious mole screenings done by Dr. Bobby Buka AND so much more we had to write a ,.,We haven’t heard from Small Black Door in a couple of months, and yes, we missed it! This cool DIY gallery in Ridgewood has now prepared a gathering of its friends and invited them to …bring themselves. Yes, this l,invites you to bring in something, preferably hand-made, reminiscent of your practice and spirit and leave with a piece of someone else’s. Our favorite DJ and a , host jojoSOUL will be spinning some of his summer finest. Don’t miss it!,Charming, old Dutch farm house, surrealistically located between the warehouses of Flushing Ave, is inviting everyone to their Flea Market. Over 55 vendors, hot food, cool people and live music sound like a lot of fun. Park on the street or on the fence if you come biking.,One of our favorite Brooklyn blogs, , is organizing a self-guided pub crawl in our lovely pigeon town. The fellow bloggers are promising rivers of FREE Brooklyn Summer Ale and some Instagram fun! But! The trick is to come out at noon, which let’s face it, might be a problem on a Saturday ,  Than grab a lucky drinking card (quickly, because they only have 500 of them) at Tradesman or Pine Box Rock Shop. With a card like that you can drink at selected Bushwick bars until the supply lasts. At 4pm everyone is invited to Tandem for an afterparty with $3 beers. Thank you Brooklyn Based for keeping us nice and mellow (aka drunk on Brooklyn Summer Ale) since early morning ,
The second show at a gigantic awesome music venue , has been cancelled due to the illness of the artist. We hope that the Brazillian rock legends will get better soon, but also we’re kinda thankful we can go see them some other day., ,My curiosity fueled by the intriguing name of this new gallery brought me last Friday to ,. Sunset Surf Club is a very new and a very different art space on Wilson Avenue.  Ran by conceptual artist and curator Julian A. Jimarez Howard, Sunset Surf Club seems to be placing the main emphasis on the concept and the idea behind the gallery as such., ,The gallery opened only three months ago and undertook to host bi-to-tri-monthly art shows and events. Their current show is already their fifth show. “I carry suitcases for rich people at The Standard Hotel, and I have never had as much money I have right now,” said Julian with a large smile on his face. “…and this is what I’ve always wanted to do,” he said about the existence of his brain child, Sunset Surf Club.,Sunset Surf Club is located on 253 Wilson Ave, a block past Myrtle Avenue in a storefront next to a barber shop and a tattoo studio. Despite the relaxed vibe surrounding the gallery, the space is absolutely pristine with beautiful finishes.  I feel like the unknown and the planned are existing in great symbiosis at Sunset Surf Club. The surprise element that comes with frequently rotating art shows supplemented with dumpling workshops doesn’t intervene with the well defined concept and the idea of the space as an incubator of new ideas and a challenger of traditional gallery values. Sunset Surf Club doesn’t need to appeal commercially. In fact Sunset Surf Club is blatantly rejecting the , of the gallery. “It’s a seasonal name,” explained Julian the name of the gallery. “We are changing ‘Sunset Surf Club’ into something else in October.”,The current show ,features charcoal drawings of Justin Hunt Sloane. The artist himself suggested the pieces are not hung on the walls, but placed horizontally on the floor. “I didn’t want them to be too serious,” Justin said. The only two pieces hanging on the walls are a , movie poster and pages from a book of prints released simultaneously with the exhibition. The drawings are tracing Justin’s recurring dream and are a “crossing between printmaking, abstraction and letterform, flatness and depth.” Placed between the drawings, several plans are connected to dripping hospital infusions., , , , , ,“Mayor of Bushwick!” said Robert, a resident of Palmetto Street for 30 years now. His friendly wife Lenette corrected him laughing ”Mayor of this block maybe.” Everybody in Bushwick knows Robert and he knows everybody. It was a sunny Sunday afternoon in Bushwick, and a merry company was resting on a stoop and chatting about life and a 12-day old snow white husky puppy. Robert is not only an unofficial mayor of Bushwick but also a big animal lover. Four husky puppies with blue eyes were just born in his railroad apartment and increased the number of his dogs to nine… “But the puppies are all spoken for,” said Robert proudly.  , ,If you’re an indie music lover with a soft spot for industrial aesthetics, I hope you got yourself over to , last weekend for the ,. In its second year, the fest was back with a huge line-up of bands and a whole lotta booze. Here’s what went down: two days and nights of great rock music, all the Sixpoint you can handle, hearty burgers, and a relaxed crowd. The weather alternated between drizzling and balmy, but the great local talent was more than adequate distraction., ","

"Tuesday night , hosted a one-night-only crab boil FEAST at its homey location at the corner of Irving and Jefferson. One of the area’s best restaurants, Ghia pulled out all the stops to bring a little Maryland to Brooklyn.,The restaurant offered two seatings, at 7:30 and 9:30, which near-completely sold out. Each attendee was preparted with specific instructions about how exactly to crack our Maryland blue crabs, a set of tools, a delicious butter-aioli dipping sauce, and classic crab bibs.,The $30-per-person bill allowed for 6 crabs each, but it really ended up as a mouthwatering all-you-can-eat affair. Not to mention unlimited sides of corn on the cob, watermelon, and potato wedges. There was an actual crab expert on site to explain to us clueless city folk how to eat seafood properly.,It was a truly excellent experience! I personally ate so many crabs I perfected the craft and now consider myself an expert. Very stoked, below.,The waitresses said that the feast was both very fun and successful and Ghia plans to have at least two boils next year, at the beginning and end of summer.  I personally CAN’T WAIT! Thanks, Ghia!,Quiet after storm. That’s Bushwick this week after last week’s art+music insanity. But it wouldn’t be Bushwick if its quietness didn’t come with creativity and in style with great music and poetry in the air. What should not be missed this week? Here is our selection!, ,If you’re into reading, writing and listening, do not miss the second installment of this summer’s ,.

At the same time like Fireside Follies, another great event is taking place at a gallery Studio 10. Brooklyn Poets Reading Series will start at 7pm and will feature a strong trio of poets Alex Dimitrov, Timothy Donnelly, and Dorothea Lasky.,Soft Black belongs to one of the cult Bushwick bands. They will be playing on Thursday at Shea Stadium. Head there with $8 in your pocket, and be ready to see also Island Twins, Weird Rivers, & Makeup Monsters.,Awesome installation and a lot of experimental music at Secret Project Robot can be expected to be seen at Secret Project Robot until August 4. Join them also tonight for Noise Wednesdays: Episode 1 featuring the duets of Erik Zajaceskowski and Greem Jellyfish, Adam Marciewicz and Sto, Amy Cimini and Annegret Falkner, Patrick Spadine and Eli Lehrhoff. None of these people has ever jammed together before. Sounds like fun!,There will be a massive sale at Mary Meyer boutique on Bogart Street. They are celebrating 1 year in the hood and invited DJ, bands and will be serving free booze. Go buy something nice and don’t forget to paarty!, , ,A big glowy yellow summer sun was going down behind the industrial wasteland of Meserole Street. An abundance of street art, big black limos (!!!), a line of people waiting in front of the door. It was Saturday evening, and arguably the coolest event in New York was happening right there in East Williamsburg Industrial Park., , ,“We opened last Tuesday,” said a girl smiling behind the counter at Hi Mango. The newest addition to the natural grocery stores in the area just opened on 1055 Flushing Ave.  After a tweet from , I was really curious whether Hi Mango will be good alternative to get some quality food and produce or essentially ,., ,
It’s been a long time since I got excited to go to a party because of its promo video. Flashing lights, color, and yelling through my computer screen is a way to make this little lady attend your fiesta. This year’s third annual Bushwick Block Party’s promo video has been that incentive to attend the 3rd annual Bushwick Block Party. The festivities will be held on  , from noon to midnight at , (ya know, that small pizza joint on Moore St.) and sponsored by Vans, Vitamin Water, and several local businesses. So ladies and Gentlemen, mark your calendars to have some fun.,Besides the party’s epically awesome promo video, the Bushwick Block Party will have not one but two musical stages with performances by Your Youth, Iyez, Naam, Soft Spot, Gang Signs, Wild Yaks, MC Todd Experience, Heems from Das Racist, headliner Andrew W.K, plus many more performances. All of the acts are from the New York City area.,If the musical performances aren’t worth your while to attend the Bushwick Block Party. I hope delicious food like Crif Dogs, Bunna Cafe, Momo Sushi Shack, Aracini Brothers, and other food vendors will change your mind. And, I must not forget, from 12-2 there will be free slices of margherita pizza. Aside from the food and music the block party will have Water World, Photobooth by Ryan Slack and much more fun activities for you kiddies.,Partying in the streets isn’t the only thing you can do, Roberta’s will be having an exclusive Tiki Disco featuring Knife Show, Max Sussman, Andy Pry Ortega, and much more musical talent.,If you happen not be travelling the world this summer and will be in the Bushwick area come to the Bushwick Block Party at 261 Moore St. and have some wicked fun!!!,: We were additionally informed, for all you friendly folks that think they have a suspicious mole, there will be free suspicious mole screenings done by Dr. Bobby Buka. I hope this is another reason for you to attend., ,My ears perked up when a new coffee shop opened on Knickerbocker Ave; about 40 feet from my apartment. The small space previously existed as Long Lai Thai restaurant, now houses a cute, homey, and kid-friendly coffee shop with a cupcake bakery (along with a rotating gallery!). ,.,Owner, glassblower and Cake Artist Elaine Li seems to be ushering the cupcake era into Bushwick. Yes, you might find a cupcake littered in a bodega somewhere else along Knikerbocker, but her cupcakes and cakes, (which she frosted right in from of me) from red velvet to dulce de leche, are delactable. Not to mention well-schmeared bagels and top notch coffee….,I love the eclectic mash of art on the walls and tables at Sweet & Shiny. From glass blown dishes, an oragami hanging sculpture to beautiful paintings and photographs, all by local artists. The next gallery show will feature the art work of children made during ,‘s kids’ art workshops.,To stay posted about kids’ classes and cupcakes, like , page., , , , , , , , , ,[mappress mapid=""67""], , ,After a year, , is coming back to ,!

Many of the , (41, can you believe that?) are having openings this week.

Simply because we love you, the galleries, and the bars ,The gallery week starts early! On Thursday, dear friends head to Weldon Arts, a brand new gallery on the Bushwick art map. Located at 181R Irving Avenue, Weldon Arts focuses “on emerging artists and street artists with an aim of advancing the culture and creating a dialogue with the public.” Their new show features Cassius Fouler in a show titled ,. Fouler uses a mixture of expressionist and illustrational techniques to paint a timeless graffiti iconography with a folk art sensibility., Weldon Arts has drinks sponsored by 1-800-Tequila and music by DJ Graze, so the after party will take place right there, in the gallery!,Have you heard a better name for a gallery than Sunset Surf Club? I haven’t! On Friday they are showing Justin Hunt Sloane and his collection of charcoal drawings. In connection with the exhibition, a book will be released “as a catalog of the drawings as well as a non-linear narrative taken from a dream.” Sweet!,: Sunset surfers like to get lost in the steam of , after their openings. You can find me there as well. Or not (because of the steam!).,Weeknights is an interesting project by Jen Hitchings (yes, Jen who also , to Bushwick Daily). Jen works at ,, and she has always dreamt about having her own gallery. It’s pretty hard these days, but nothing is impossible if you really want it. And so Jen decided to give up a part of her studio at , and start…a gallery! She will be open on weeknights, hence the name. The inaugural show at Weeknights will feature a group show of 21 artists including Theresa Dadezio, Andrew Birk or Nick Greenwald. The only question left is whether The Active Space will follow the 56 Bogart model and turn into a gallery hub for Jefferson stop.,While at The Active Space, check out the new show at their main huge gallery (opened in ,). , is an exhibition of new paintings Gretchen Scherer.

Even more so that now it is a home to two galleries: Regina Rex (since 2008) and Parallel Art Space (,). The latter is having an opening on Saturday. ,, a three-person art exhibition featuring Judith Braun, Antonia Perez, and Hilda Shen.,The Living Gallery at , is great. Run by energetic community supporter Nyssa Frank, the gallery prepared an exhibition featuring the works of students of Academy of Urban Planning High School in Bushwick and their families. The students and their families are part of a “Graduate, Prepare, Succeed” partnership program with ,, a non-profit arts organization. The goal of the exhibition is to foster the community and give these talented students from Bushwick necessary exposure.

"To save you from embarrassment, I’ll tell you right from the start that George Ferrandi is not only an amazing artist and the director of , she is also a woman. And when George was moving her studio from Williamsburg to Bushwick two years ago, she undertook to create something more than just another studio building. She undertook to create a community of artists of a similar mind set, and a loving place that nourishes one’s creativity.,One of the newest Bushwick artist studio buildings, serves also as a woodshop and a gallery space. Brooklyn Wayfarers is located on Dekalb Avenue, all the way past Broadway right past a church and across the street from a tire shop. When walking from studio to studio at Wayfarers, you can feel the touch of George Ferrandi’s curation who also teaches sculpture at RISD. Many of the resident artists are excellent sculptors who use natural materials like wood or clay (Craig Hein, David ‘Scout’ McQueen), but you can also find classically trained painters like Charlotte Evans from England who paints restrained landscapes., ,“We took our time,” said George regarding the operation of the gallery. They scraped, sanded, painted and drywalled for five months, so the first artists could move in in May, 2011. When the community of people was almost complete, they started to organize art shows. The idea is that every artist in a private studio is entitled to a solo show after a year in the building, or they can curate a show. But generally, George is open to ideas and basically anything can happen. “We just had a panel about kinetic sculpture, and a dance party before,” said George., , ,Wayfarers is a good place, surrounded by a beautiful peaceful energy. The building feels more like a home to an artist collective rather than a set of separate studios., , , , , , , , ,How to get a studio in this Bushwick paradise? “You send us your portfolio, and if we’re interested in the work, we would like to meet you to see if we’re a good fit,” says George about the application process. There are two tiers of membership in the program; private studios are affordable and go for $325 on average. Shared studio space in the shop is about $125 and comes with a storage unit. Both levels of membership include unlimited access to the facilities (the kitchen/common area with wifi, woodshop, silk screen printing facility), and entitle you to participation in several annual group shows., , , , , , , , , {FreeWilliamsburg}, {NY Magazine}, {Brokelyn}, {Brooklyn Rail}, {New York Times}, {DNAinfo}, , , ,After last week’s distressing heat wave, you probably found yourself wondering , if this happens again, what are some cool ways to keep cool (right?!) that don’t involve laying naked on a wet towel for hours on end? You’re in luck. After some research that definitely did not involve laying naked on a wet towel for hours – these simple, yet effective methods blossomed to fruition…, , Don’t have a shower? Call a friend and use a friend’s shower. Don’t have a friend? Go to McCarren Park, avoid being face-punched, and don’t do a backflip! You’ll make friends in no time., This should probably be number one, as hoses are awesome. They fight fires, fill up kiddy pools, keep kids off the lawn, and are an intrinsic part of slip-n-slides & comical skits showing how weak someone is! Also, you can spray your friends in the face and drink out of ‘em!, Not only will you get an abrupt icy blast, you’ll be able to come to terms with the fact that those frozen vegetables that’ve been there for a year and a half probably aren’t going anywhere… “But maybe I’ll cook those this week…” No you won’t. Just take them out, wrap them in a paper towel and put them on your forehead… then take pictures of how awesome you look.,Sit at some sort of annoying angle on the floor and blow on said ice pack so that your breath deflects from the ice pack right onto your friends face. This is essentially how A/C’s work (knowledge!) and from what I understand, how Mr. Freeze works too. Do this lil’ quick tip at a party for a great way to break the ice… (pause for roaring laughter…… anndddd finish with kiss-fingers-throw-peace-sign…. perfect)., General stores work great for this because their walls are teeming with only-moderately-useful tools from the late 90s and what I assume to be one-of-a-kind authentic holograms of tigers. Definitely pick something up and tinker with it for a few minutes, comparing it to something else that bears no similarities, thus leading you to nod your head in approval and mouth the words “ohh ok” slowly, and with delicate concern., And throw them out the window. Because your mesh Umbros and Fila tennis shorts will be doing all the work for you this Summer. Champ., Which is definitely a real thing. Call all your friends and tell them to bring their A/Cs over to your place. They will, because hauling an A/C around isn’t difficult at all and you told them you were naked on a towel. When they get there, throw old frozen vegetables at them whilst blowing rapidly on ice-packs in their general direction. By the time they realize what the hell is going on, they’ll think you’re suffering from a heat stroke and promptly install the A/C. To keep the crazy going – keep saying “ICE TO MEET YOU” and laughing at your own ability to quote pop-culture 90s flicks. You’re welcome.,After 3 successful festivals in LA over the last 3 years, DIY/DIT* collective , brought the Fest east to New York for the first time this year. Spanning 3 days and nights (and a budget of $0), just about 50 bands played in ,, ,, ,, and ,.,The Fest additionally included art installations, panel discussions, and workshops with topics ranging from ‘comic drawing/zine making’ to ‘maintaining anti-oppressive attitudes in DIY communities.’ Notable acts (read: my favorites) included Megafortress, Truman Peyote, Yohuna, Birthdays, Little Spoon, Mutual Benefit, Emily Reo, Chiffon, and Persona La Ave…just to name a few. Check the,., ,What made FMLY Fest so special was not so much the great music and art, but the ‘feel’. Wowww really? But yeah, I’ll stick to that. The festival was engineered to foster the ‘collective spirit,’ avoiding parallel bookings in different venues or stages, and instead opting for a daytime and nighttime venue for music and activities…even allowing some time for the mass migration between the two.,It’s great to see how much people can do together without kickstarters or sponsorships. While FMLY is working on FMLY Fest in L.A. (#4) for this December, let’s hope for another in Bushwick this time next year. Get involved! Read more about,*Do It Together,First of all, let me say , is BALLIN’. Yes, it may technically challenge , a (just east of Grand Street at Morgan Ave) but its industrial placement, smokestack-ed exterior, and ecclectic and artful interior will make it the perfect bike distance from our pigeon town. In the same industrial clump as successful DIY venues like , and ,, , is a high-quality reinvention of the DIY space. Mid to late August is the projected opening time- and we’re waiting anxiously!,Funded by partners and best buds ,(smiling above) and ,(who all previously worked at Pianos on LES), the space was a brain project bringing together the music and drinks in an undeniably unique atmosphere. Exposed brick lines the main room, once a rectangle, now filled out by a hand-built wooden bar, a music venue in the back, two twin skylights, and a hundred pieces of found and collected furniture and furnishings. From murals to an enormous (10 feet tall) moon suspended from the ceiling and gumball machines, from polynesian-style woven chairs to 50s-style retro bar stools, Delinquency is a feast for your eyes., ,The music venue area in the back was designed and built to be multi-purpose- for more intimate shows, a curving set of doors closes the area off from the bar.  For larger shows, the doors swing away to invite the entire bar space to enjoy the show.,‘s ,(who we are quite fond of, ,) is the booker at the space and we can only expect the highest quality shows to go on here. A whole lot to look forward to, for foodies, musicians, music-lovers and people who just love cool new places.,Bonus! If you want to see BEFORE pics of the space, which was cool even when it was an empty warehouse, check out , we wrote on a show there almost a year ago! How the times have changed., , ,NURTUREart’s director Marco Antonini can officially start to be known as a creative summer curator with unique ideas. Last year he created awesome series WE ARE collaborating with different Bushwick Art Spaces; this year he created a series f three exhibitions, featuring artworks, ephemera and publications that have been mostly conceived and produced to be freely distributed. Art work that will ultimately become a part of the show will be outsourced to community high-school students and members of our audience.,Eleven artists working in collage will be featured in this summer Storefront Bushwick show. Additionally, neighborhood’s favorite abstract painter Julie Torres (recently reviewed by ,) has a show in the project room.  The show titled ,displays interesting twist in Torres’ work toward 3D and painting/object creation.,Experimental DIY venue Shea Stadium features great bands tonight. , among others.,Inter State, a gallery of Tom Weinrich has always been a one of the more interesting spots at 56 Bogart building. Now, the space has moved to 66 Knickerbocker. To celebrate the move, Inter State is throwing a party featuring performance by Shana Moulton, reading by Ben Gocker, music and refreshments.,Our tip for Saturday night is the band Caged Animals.,: 11am-7opm: Occupy Town Square Bushwick,Occupy Bushwick & Occupy Town Square present a day of teach-ins, political discussion, food, music, and celebration. Bring your kids and enjoy the day while being active for the good thing.,: Kids’ Art Workshop + Free cupcakes (10am-12pm for years 1-6, 2pm-5pm for years 6-10),Sweet & Shiny, the new kid-friendly coffee shop on Knickerbocker (more info on Bushwick Daily soon) is having an art workshop this Sunday. For just $20, children will have a 2-hour art workshop along with free cupcakes! Their creations will also be feautred in an art show at the Coffee shop. Get ‘em started young!, , , , ,Last night Facebook was a just a little bit more exciting than usual. ,, a social media artist based in Bushwick, decided to delete his Facebook profile. He approached the protest against Facebook as a performance, and all of his 1,500+ friends enjoyed some crazy poking, all caps statuses and wall posting insanity.,About a week ago that Man Bartlett realized that the cup of Facebook crap is full, and he decided to leave. He created a ,, which resembled a good bye letter, and invited all his friends encouraging them to stay in touch using other means. The departure to the ‘other’ world was scheduled at midnight after his birthday on July 5. Man could have hardly pick a better date, because as is every Facebook user aware, birthdays are the craziest time of all when hundreds of people post wishes on your wall. Man Bartlett encouraged everyone to post on his wall excessively, and as the hour of his departure approached he was posting more and more statuses. Additionally, Man decided to poke all of his friends before the midnight, which became a source of overall commotion and turmoil. Some of my favorite statuses by Man in his last hour included: “ANY QUESTIONS?,” which really generated many questions; or “NOTIFICATIONS ARE PILING UP FASTER THAT I CAN POKE;” “IT’S REALLY WEIRD TO POKE GALLERY DEALERS.”,It’s hard to tell how many people were sitting behind their computers refreshing Man Bartlett’s profile around midnight waiting for it to disappear but  I am guessing quite a lot.,Here is a video from the last minutes of Man Bartlett on Facebook:, ,Right after Man Bartlett stopped exisiting as a Facebook user, I asked him a couple of questions relating to his last days.,According to Facebook, since 2006. Though I thought it was a bit earlier than that. I remember being salty for a while because I needed a .edu address and I was already out of school. But I went through the process of getting my old Emerson College address back and signed up with that. But then a couple months later it was open to everyone., is the guy who made a sculpture of ,. As if it wasn’t enough, he thought it would be cool if there was something going on in the pizza bubble. Something like rave. With a strobe light and a disco ball. Why not, right? He added house music thudding from inside of the rave bubble, and that’s how , began. His funny sculptural piece named the art show of our artsy sister , that took place at , and is currently available ,.,Jerstin has a background in sculpture but nowadays cannot be called anything other than a multidisciplinary artist. He creates multimedia sculptures inspired by random juxtapositions we experience while surfing the internet. He frequently experiments with animation and video using traditional and new media like the silkscreen animation process and with footage filmed on an infrared Microsoft Kinect camera.,Jerstin lives in Bed-Stuy, works at Wayfarers and has a cool cat. We asked him a bunch of questions about his work., , , , ,I spent the weekend wandering through Bushwick looking at things though the viewfinder of my camera.

" ,With regards to ,, it was among the first wave of galleries that opened in Bushwick. They focused on street art with a vengeance and featured among others ,, ,, and have a , that spans a block. It seems that the mural will run until sometime in 2012.,Now that there is a sign on the door advertising a commercial space for lease one would be safe in assuming that the gallery is defunct as a physical entity. At least for the moment, and at least in Bushwick.,This lead us at , that the ,. Pair that with, that the gallery is closed, it makes for a fairly solid lead. We reported as such, and saw a , in which it was stated that we were in the wrong about the state of the gallery. We reached out to Ali Ha stating that if she would like to correct our article, we’d be happy to update it. A few lambasting emails later and we learned that the gallery is continuing in some form, perhaps as an online gallery, or perhaps in a different area. However, we can’t confirm either of those details as Ali Ha no longer wishes to communicate with Bushwick Daily.,So let me lay down the metric by which Factory Fresh was included in the original article about closed galleries:,If you are a gallerist with a shuttered gallery as I am now (author was a gallery director at ,, a loft gallery that recently closed down due to loft law and other difficulties), no matter how temporary it may seem to the purveyors of said gallery, then you are a former gallerist. Furthermore, if you don’t have a gallery in the greater Bushwick area (for sake of argument, let’s go with the Bushwick Open Studios map), then you are a former Bushwick Gallerist.,Speaking as a former gallerist, I plan to curate shows, sell art work, and represent artists to the best of my ability. These things make me an independent curator, an art dealer, and some form of an artist agent, respectively.,The mob mentality on display in the series of emails that we received from Ali Ha suggests that she believes that it is possible to threaten writers and bloggers into not disseminating the writing on the wall.,To the new curators and gallerists in the neighborhood: There is no such thing as bad press and you do not dictate the terms by which the press depicts you. You can send corrections, which are always welcome. We too are artists and are slaves to the truth.,Regardless, you are responsible for your own actions. We were perfectly willing to correct any mistakes that we made in that article and any future articles. Bushwick, by and large, is a community that is perfectly willing to be supportive in most efforts and endeavors that each of us takes on.,So let’s play devil’s advocate here: What if I wrote to any of you reading this and told you what a fuck up you were? That you were responsible for my business folding?,What if I took the burden of responsibility off of my own shoulders and put that on yours?,Would you then want to be a part of my community? Would you want me to be a part of yours?,The main point of this article is to remind those with hubristic delusions of grandeur that you don’t tell me or any contributer at Bushwick Daily (or any other publication) what or how to write. Inspiration comes from the spirit. If you take issue with the tone of an article, let us know. If we got a fact wrong, let us know. If we need to know about a new development in a story, let us know.,But don’t ever think that we can be intimidated into towing your party’s line. We wish you the best in your future endeavors and hope that Factory Fresh reopens with the same vigor they had on Flushing Avenue.,One final note, if you do decide to tell your friends to say and write nasty things about us. Just remember that you heard it here first.,Good luck., ,How wobbly does my tree pose really need to be? Cobra Club, Bushwick’s newest yoga studio, is also a fully licensed,
bar.  Let’s be clear here, though: the tipple is a post-practice activity at Cobra Club. Although there is a Sunday ‘hangover session’, where I can only hope the headstands are optional.  , is expanding!,In April, we began live broatcasting in collaboration with DJ ,, which has evolved into a weekly broadcast called , featuring an eclectic mix of obscure tracks and talk.,This month we are launching two new shows: a culture based talk/interview show with Sean Alday called , and ,, an Indie Music Show hosted by our music editor Maria Gotay. Our radio runs on ,, which is an awesome new website making it really easy to broadcast. Also, it allows the listeners to directly interact with the radio hosts ,, and ask questions or requests songs.  If you miss a show, you can listen to it in the ,.,BUT our greatest pleasure is to announce that we are crowd sourcing our radio programming. We want to hear your show, your ideas on Bushwick Daily Radio. We want to hear about what interests you, what do you think people need to hear about. Is it local news? Do you want to interact with people about the issues facing the community? Does your venue have live events that should be heard by those who can’t make it? Do you possess an extensive knowledge of the local music scene? Or poetry readings? What about a lullaby hour? Or maybe you’re Bushwick’s answer to Martha Stewart?,Contact us. We want to put the voices of the community on the air.,Anyone can hear it from around the world. Tres Brooklyn!,Learn More. Pitch Your Idea. Create A Show.,Contact us at , ,Since the 4th of July marks the unofficial beginning of summer, make sure you spend it somewhere nice, preferably outdoors and in good company! Bushwick is famous for its roofs, backyards and friendly community, and offers several great options this year. Here is our selection of five only-in-Bushwick 4th of July events.,Secret Project Robot is one of our favorite art spaces in Bushwick for its great space on Melrose Street and for its original event. For this year’s Independence Day, they have prepared vinyl musical selections of Jamaica sounds by Queen Majesty, Grace of Spades and Sweet V. Food. The party will be in a chill atmosphere in their gallery space and in the garden. The Robots are promising drinks and food as well. $4 will get you in., invites you over to a backyard on Troutman street, and promises a Tropical theme, a mini pool, and grilling contest…for starters. Grilling begins at 3pm, and eclectic live music at 6pm. These guys are also seeking artists to put up installations and enthusiasts to cook. Make sure to show up!,If you want to spend your Independence Day high on a roof observing serene Manhattan skyline, Bushwick industrial romance and, most importantly, fireworks, you should head to 1085 Willoughby Ave. These folks are hosting a cook out party with bands. This is a BYOMeat/BYOB event.,One of the newest additions to the neighborhood’s cultural scene, The Paper Box, is throwing an event that looks like fun fun fun. There will be cookout, open grill, bloody marries, and a long line-up of performers. Go check ‘em out at 17 Meadow Street.,DIY venue Shea Stadium prepared an extra early show for the 4th of July with a line up  of their all star bands (Dope Body, Roomrunner, Fuckton, Alan Watts, Ami Dang, Eleven Swords, Smhoak & Pals, The Jazz Massagers). Be there at 4:20pm with $10 in pocket for admission.,Welcome to Bushwick! This is the real deal – the living, breathing art scene of New York. 35+ galleries and hundreds of artist studios. Let’s be thankful that we are here to enjoy it. At Bushwick Daily we have been asked on numerous occasions when the best day is to visit Bushwick galleries and what else there is to do. I believe that the best day for an art adventure in Bushwick is Sunday because most of the galleries have open hours, and you can combine the gallery stroll with a Sunday brunch and après-gallery drinks.,Whether you’re coming from another borough or just from two blocks down the road, you should start your artsy Sunday with a delicious brunch. A middle aged couple from Manhattan stopped me on the street last week to ask if there were any safe brunching options in Bushwick. I had to laugh because Bushwick could be easily renamed to ,. Bushwick has plenty of great brunch options. This week, I would like to highlight Cafe Ghia, which immediately became a neighborhood favorite when it opened over a year ago. Basically, everything about this place is lovely. The bright interior has plenty of light, nice service and, most importantly, delicious and affordable ,. My personal pick is , for $10 (,Tofu, sweet potato, kale, scallion, spicy black bean sauce, and ginger-lime tofu “cream,” served with toast.), , , , ,Two birds with one stone (wink wink)! Regina Rex is in the same building like Parallel Art Space recommended for their closing brunch. They are open on Fridays through Sundays 12-6pm with their current exhibition ,(featuring EJ Hauser, Nancy Haynes, and Sarah Peters).,Walk over to 16 Wilson Ave and enjoy the current exhibition of Abdolreza Aminlari and Drew Shiflett in the main room, and a group show , in the project room (Nancy Bowen, Matthew Mahler, Paula Overbay and Lauren Seiden).,When on the Sunday gallery stroll, don’t miss the opportunity to check out the extended exhibition of Emma Bee Bernstein’s polaroids titled ,. Emma Bernstein committed suicide at the age of 23 in Venice, Italy. Bernstein transformed “the spontaneous, on-the-spot Polaroid aesthetic into a generational portrait of hyper-self-conscious, passionately alluring young women and men taking on adulthood with deadly serious abandon.”,After the gallery stroll, stop by for an artisanal beer or cocktail at Miles on 101 Wilson, or for a beergarita at Cain’s Tavern at 36 Wilson.  If you didn’t get enough culture, you can catch an excellent play at The , theater , at 8pm.,As Bushwick is not only arts, but also indie music mecca. Here are the concerts this weekend in our beloved pigeon town!,: Schwervon!, Supercute!, Berth Control ($7),: 8pm: Genuine Imitations, Turbosleaze, Sediment Club, Phat Rascals,: Free Show Party on the roof with Plant, NT, Eula, Sleepies, ,The festival celebrating DIY culture in Brooklyn, , took place over the course of 3 days in 3 different DIY venues (Vaudeville Park, BK Fire Proof, House of Yes). Each night was filled with entrepreneurs and creatives alike, each contributing in their own way throughout a variety of artistic outlets. Many got a chance to meet others who had similar goals and achievements. Some of the participating DIY collective members or founders had years of experience, and others were just starting out as little tadpoles in the overwhelmingly artistic sea of Bushwick. We couldn’t miss it, and these were the moments that won’t be forgotten….,The first night of the festival was held at ,.  Ian Colletti moderated a panel discussion, which included a skype conference with members of , (Bushwick and Detroit), the founders of Morsel Gallery (Bushwick in the early 2000′s), Esther Neff and Brian McKorkle from Performancey Forum, and other collective participants who focused on theatre, experimental music, and performance. The discussion informed the audience of the various stories, trials, and tribulations which come with running (oftentimes illegal) spaces and events in run-down city neighborhoods.,The second night at ,  was filled with live music (including one incredibly talented and upbeat drummer/DJ that Rachael met while he was busking on a subway platform), artwork curated by Jen Hitchings (that’s me), a discussion about the functionality of the contemporary art world, and a very intimate and encompassing dance performance put on by , (we reviewed the performance separately ,).,The last night of the festival took place at the ,. Performers in flashy garb danced while waiting for a drink at the bar. You couldn’t tell if someone was sincerely trying to engage you in a conversation or if they were performing and you were unknowingly participating in their fantasy world. There were smoke machines, loud beats, masks, glitter, and lots of skin., ,By the end of the festival, I’d realized I had not been exposed to such a variety of performances and discussions at any single event since living in the city. , left me hoping that more events like this one would sprout up in Brooklyn., , , , ,I spoke with Lucia Rollow, a powerhouse organizer within the workaholic organization: ,. It turns out that she wasn’t only sending out thousands of emails for ,, but also working behind the scenes for , and right in front at the , among other things., ,As of lately, we have been experiencing an influx of new galleries, bars and restaurants in Bushwick.  This post however, traces back four exceptional galleries that closed down recently. We would like pay homage to the places that helped to shape and form the art scene in Bushwick, and highlight their greatest moments., ,Life Cafe is closing down permanently on June 30, 2012. Yesterday, Kathy Life, the owner of Life Cafe, a cult Bushwick eatery and watering hole announced it on their ,.   Kathy and her husband, now in their sixties are being involuntarily sent to the earlier retirement by their landlord who decided not to extend their lease. “…the landlord of my thriving Bushwick café told me that he was not going to extend my lease,” Kathy writes on the website.  ","

"Before you let go in favor of the tomorrow beach ,, let’s look together at the iconic Coney Island of the 1920s. Thanks to , Photo gallery, you can now spent hours of looking at old New York in photography. We made a selection of some of the most nostalgic beach photos from the period.,The publication , by Elliot Willensky reveals, Coney Island has been attracting crowds since 1920 when the Stillwell Avenue subway station was opened:,[quote]The nickel was the stabilized price for the ride, the hot dog and milk shake; and at Nathan’s, orange drink could be had for only three cents. Coney Island had become the watering place of , the people, not just the select visitors (as had been the case of earlier era)- scions of high society and patrons of organized vice. The extension of the subway to Coney Island had brought the resort within the nickel’s reach of all the city’s millions, making it a favored place to take the family for a weekend outing. It came to be called “the Nickel Empire”…..[/quote], , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,Walking up to the door of , for a portion of ,, I was naively surprised to see well-coiffed ladies attached at the arm to designer suits with bodies inside them. But the surprise quickly gave way to understanding. This was one event among several strategically timed after Bushwick Open Studios so as to not be lost amongst the weekend, but still attract some of the curious rubber-neckers who came back for more.,It’s usually the case with good-hearted performance art during the summer that the aroma of sweaty crotches hits you at the door. There’s nothing to fear in pheromones and it really added to the ambiance. The watchers were seated in a large circle under the art curated by our own ,, and there were quite a few in the standing room section. It was packed enough that I may have knocked a little boy on his head with my notebook as he ran to the bathroom.,It’s pretty simple to hang a light bulb from the center of a room, get some cloth and a few dancers and call it performance art. But that’s the cynic talking. The choreography was very start/stop and served to heighten the tension between the audience and the performers.,By tension I mean subtle flicks of ears and grasping the wall inches above someone’s head. People were trying to look non-plussed but there was little room to hide. An original-ish score by Matthew Siffert was interpreted on a clarinet, piano, cello and recordings including the refrain from “Send In The Clowns.”,I can’t claim to know what they were getting at. But a pretty obvious interpretation is “we are all beings running fore and aft while the light dangles.” I cringed writing that sentence in the darkened room. I don’t know how much of the beginning of the performance I missed.,Normally I’d advocate nude performance art, and I’m not disavowing it here, but the shawled performers made the audience uncomfortable emperors in this context. Which was appreciated at least by me.,Maybe this report sounds a bit crabby. I blame the heat, my crotch is sweating., , , ,A fascinating warehouse on ,. located right on the boarder of Bushwick and Ridgewood, is a home to hundreds of artist studios. The building is so giant that some people have to ride a bike in the endless hallways to get to their studio at the end of the floor. This industrially romantic studio buildings is proud of its large windows, which provide for plenty of light and tall ceilings. Moreover, the deck on the second floor is one of the most magical spots in the area. It offers an unforgettable view of Manhattan skyscrapers interlaced with Brooklyn water towers. You can sit there with your friends or by yourself, drinking beer or simply enjoying the serenity of this industrial beauty… Naturally, there is a plenty of splendid art being created behind the doors. The building is now a home to two galleries. , opened in 2010, belongs to the areas’ finest; and ,, its younger sibling (opened in April 2012) quickly gained the reputation of a spotless location for exceptional art., , ,All that , magic causes that 1717 Troutman is one of the highlights of any , weekend, and this year wasn’t an exception. I admit that I suffer from artist studio voyeurism, and I love to observe them as a living organisms, the last pencil being as important as the art work itself. During this year’s BOS, I enjoyed getting lost in 1717 Troutman building for several hours…., , , , , , , , ,More photos:,You may have heard of a little something called , It’s only largest and the coolest  festival to be born in Brooklyn. In it’s fourth year- and my third year attending- I was again swept away by the way Northside encompasses the vibrancy of Williamsburg’s art, music, and intellectual scene in a very home-grown way. Featuring separate music, film, art and entrepreneurial segments, there’s something for everyone. The music segment has always dominated the festival and this year boasted a crazy variety of headliners, form , to , to ,- only in Brooklyn? Last weekend I took my press badge and raced from venue to venue, getting a true Northside festival experience. Now, the best of the music that I saw, with links to tons of free music!,[box]Friday: ,,,, and, at Music Hall of Williamsburg- Brooklyn Vegan Showcase[/box], ,, we definitely , from some time now. This Bushwick outfit embodies all things that make rock-and-roll catchy; at times full, loud, and soaring with a reverb guitar and concisely pounding drums, other times with minimal sound to let the beautifully jaded vocals steal your attention. They tell stories with their songs, and in a very convincing way. Check out their , where you can grab their EP for free!,Second came ,, alumnus of Brooklyn royalty girl bands , and ,, whom I’ve been wanting to see since her incredible record , hit the scene in February. For her impressive garage rock background, the sleek, electronic, cool-to-the-touch controlled nature of , seemed to come out of nowhere. The basic summary I can give of her 35-minute performance was that it was at times awesome, at times awkward, and always strange. This new persona Frankie has come to fame through- galactic lo-fi dream-pop space queen- is not entirely genuine or comfortable in a live setting. Stumbling to harmonize with her backing vocal track, her classically trained theater voice really did not sound all that similar to its album counterpart. Playing her guitar on only some songs, and when so only very minimally, I was disillusioned to what the intricate and astounding , guitar parts really meant to her. At times, she soared, giving a song her full attention- while singing a “Pair of Wings”, for example, her vocals reaching choral heights as if we were in a cathedral. Other times, I wondered who Frankie Rose is, and more importantly, where was the album’s true mastermind- the producer. Bonus points, though, Frankie Rose announced onstage that she’s moving to Bushwick, or as she called it “The new Williamsburg.” Psh, girl please!!, ,, Brooklyn’s own sentimental alternative rock stronghold, blew me away. With dual drummers carving out tribal rhythms, earnest lyrics, sweeping harmonies and subtle synths, they are extremely tight. Think ,…meets ,…with a more traditional, wholesome songwriting approach. Live, the music comes to live in a dynamic way that you can’t find on their hit album, ,. They’re a buzzband for sure, I highly recommend seeing them.,[box]Saturday: , at Brooklyn Bowl.[/box],This gorgeous atmospheric goth-pop band was a thrill to see live, for several reasons. A well-known fact about ,is that lead singer Aleksa Palladino came to fame as Jimmy Darmody’s troubled lesbian wife on ,. So, it’s safe to say a lot of us mafia fans were starstruck to see her pouring her heart out in a rare, guarded but emotional performance. Their music is excellent- a sort of haunted, roaring strain of alternative music that embodies loneliness but has pop touches twinkling beneath the surface. Awezome., ,Take a blender, mix in some shoegaze, layers of noise, some classic NYC spirit, and a beautiful Japanese girl, you’ve got ,. Though their music is mostly known for its dream poppy, quiet, subtle rock influences, they band is meant for dancing live.  Unexpectedly loud, sometimes even thrashy (!), and more rock than pop, they put on a good show. Perhaps there was less emphasis on the vocals because lead singer Yuki Chikudate admitted to having Bronchitis. Either way, the emphasis on generating an awesomely loud sound (mostly) instrumentally went over very well.,I was so happy to track down this newbie buzzband- they played a lot of shows throughout Northside. I caught , at one The Gutter, a mellow place to see them go all out in their quirky retro style. They are a female-fronted playful jazz-weird-psychedelic fusion band that has a bright future for themselves in the BK scene. A mixture of smooth textures, funky 70s-style melodies, random noises (and occasional flute!) and upbeat vocals make them an inspiring and unique group. Be sure to head over and download their LP- for free! Ah, awesome music was always meant to be free.,, you make girl power feel old and new all at the same time.  This proclaimed “garage goth” band takes all of the best guitar techniques from the 1960s and places them amongst ,-style vocals and ,-influenced drums. It sure as hell makes sense that , discovered them. From their long, black manes to black spiky pumps, these girls are styled like witches, and create a really impressive booming, shredding guitar-and-rhythm sound. They’ve (surprisingly) yet to secure a national following, but I say it’s only a matter of time before they become the faces and voices of some neo-goth designer or clothing line.,This garage punk band from Nashville, Tennessee is doing everything right. Fighting onstage, jumping into the crowd, threatening violence, and rocking the fuck out, not to mention sounding great. , fill the gap where noise garage rockers , and , and more folk-punk songwriters like , meet. These guys have a southern touch that makes their garage rock simply more accessible. Garagey-Americana guitar, punk rhythms, vocals that vary from beach boys-style harmonies (“Naked with You”) to straight-up rambunctious spitfire verses (“Want some Mo’”). They’re fun, and even after their 65ths straight day of touring, they still enthralled the crowd.,[box]Sunday: , and , at Warsaw.[/box],I trust any band that would be touring with Starfucker, and , was a breath of fresh air. Ok, yes, they sound a lot like ,. Lead singer Adam Gil has ,’s whiny drawl and the same emphasis on pronouncing words instead of letting them blend together. Yes, the rhythms are layered and tribal in the same atmospheric way. But there’s this freshness about the quartet’s sound that really makes their sound embody youth. Maybe it’s the mash of psychedelia, dance, freak-folk and straight pop that makes them so damn catchy. Maybe it’s the don’t-care attitude that allows them to layer their sprawling vocal tracks so coherently. Their rarely a harmony that it traditionally soothing; rather they rely on softly startling their viewers into paying attention. There’s nothing sleepy about this band. Download their LP for free ,!,As an age-old , fan, I suddenly felt out of place at Sunday’s show.  I haven’t been impressed with Starfucker’s last album and EP (since they dumbly attempted to change their name to ,) but remained loyal despite the growth away from lightheaded, melodic, smart electro-pop music to a less sincere psych-pop effort. The first thing that was so offsetting was that they have lost their ,-era, Ryan Biornstad, lead singer (??!!)- complete news to me, but of no concern to the 16+ crowd around me, who bopped and raved with little clue. The more overpowering concern was that the band played with little to no energy. The same songs that once radiated sounded lifeless with a different vocalist, who did little to make his voice heard above the guitars and synth (which actually did sound great.) The performance was simply lost on me, having experienced Starfucker at their peak, and a somewhat disappointing way to end Northside., ,Oh well, here are some hands!

Loaded with pool tables and generous prices/portions, this is a great summer spot. The interior is dark, weird, and loud – so coming from Bushwick -  it’ll feel just like home!

I ended up here one time after being kicked out of another bar for playing this weird game where you put a finger on a cup and yell numbers that correspond to how many fingers are on the cup… anyways, it’s unimportant, except for the fact that at Spritzenhaus, people wanted to join our confusingly noisy game! Unfortunately, they didn’t want to play “Buy me food!” as that game’s not real and I’m not , persuasive. Speaking of which, they have a loaded selection of sausage & brats, pizza, and other snacks to complement all their beer. So go sit at communal tables (some are even on the sidewalk outside), play Jenga, eat, drink, , or don’t… y’know, it’s your life., ,:,Damn right you can bike to the park named after the myth, the man, the Danish American social reformer, “muckraking” journalist and social documentary photographer… And what a way to pay homage! This is one hell-of-a-ride from Bushwick, but if you , it out with a friend… (bike joke!) you’ll get to cruise through some of the most considerably characteristic, older-than-your-parents neighborhoods Brooklyn’s created. Also, the bike lane seriously goes about 14 of the 15 miles to the beach, so no ending up on the BQE thinking top yourself: , Pfft… I could be a bike messenger – No Fear shirt and everything! Here’s a brief route description: it’s basically Bedford all the way down to the coast (and vice-versa). Depending on where you live, you’ll need to get to Bedford (said , in Williamsburg to their friends back home) but that is reasonably easy from anywhere is Brooklyn. Once you cross over the bridge, hang a right to go towards Tilden or a left to venture towards Rockaway (why?!). Extra points for a boogie board… TRIPLE RUSH!,On Saturday , held an opening for ,. An art show conceived and curated by five local high-school students for ,  is a part of NURTUREart’s Education Program headed by Molly O’Brien. The show was curated by Miguel Lopez, Cearia Janicki, Jazmin Luna, Chastity Rodriguez, and Yadria Gomez of Juan Morel Campos Secondary School. These students worked with the Director of , Christina Vassallo and their teacher , to put together the show., ,Some had participated during last year’s , and helped along the discussion in the classroom of what curating actually meant. At first the general idea was that to be a curator meant that one was like a movie director or producer. Which is to say that dictates would be given and followed accordingly.,According to Christina Vassallo, the moment when curation became distinct was during the discussions concerning the theme and the wording of the open call. The students that we spoke with were very insistent that Cearia Janicki had come up with the title “Juxtacombo” which gave them a nucleus to attach the democratically chosen theme.,The theme of the show commented on jarring inconsistencies found in early 21st century life. On the ground were raised platforms featuring patterns reminiscent of the Islamic golden age when modern algebra was developed and a world-history preserved, walking closer, you realize that these patterns are encased in a glass frame and made with sugar-coated cereal. Personally, I found the swings between a childhood spent watching Saturday-morning-cartoons eating cereal and the transition into adolescence in 2001 to be sublimely affecting and present in the work.,The Assemblyman and myself found ourselves talking about our grandmothers while standing over one piece. Definitely a symptom of the “potential for unintended interpretations.”, ,The students chose the works on display (at NURTUREart until June 29th) out of over one hundred submissions from both national and international artists. They installed the work and each reported a similar feeling of elation when calling it a “cool experience.” While curation is cool, it says something that these young adults were able to work together to put on a dense, mature, and yet still playful art show.,Or, as Molly O’Brien put it:,Every student will repeatedly hear during their school career about the “real world.” Nothing prepares you for that except jumping in feet first. This program seems to offer a stepping stone between being a herd of cats to becoming herders themselves., ,A collective calling themselves , are having a Telethon For the 1%.,“We’re trying to raise awareness for the plight of the 1%.” William Powhida tells me.,I’ve stumbled upon a 12 hour performance piece in Momenta Art staged alongside Mark Tribe’s solo exhibit Rare Earth [absolutely innocent of the performance, but culpable in photos].,Fittingly and unwittingly, the works are priced as though it were a thrift shop for the 1% where you might find a , among the fake-gold-foil-baby-Jesus paintings.,I , on that day that of the wealthiest 1% there are 99% percent that need financial assistance to purchase contemporary art. Many of them cannot afford to worry about , (with actual golden hooves) immersed in chemicals nor a seat for a personal assistant to bid on that ,., ,And really, who among them would want to be seen or photographed in the bargain bin Bushwick art galleries? Even if they were just perusing Powhida prints for grandma since she can’t tell the difference even with her glasses on. No, leave that to the intrepid reporters of ,, the ,, and compass-sporting video-reporting of the ,.,According to , – senior vice-president of Heritage Auction Galleries:,“Art galleries are limited in their offerings and client base. Heritage is an $850 million business, and there aren’t a lot of $850 million art galleries.”,Bushwick Basel? Call when you have some skulls to sell.,I once told William Powhida that I wanted to talk to him because people tend to think of him as an asshole. Here is a quick discussion we had:, How many of your patrons are in the 1%?, I’d say about 95% of them., So how much did you make last year on art sales?, Well, I don’t know precisely but, a rough estimate based on quarters puts the amount at around $30,000 for the year. Which is not close to a middle class lifestyle., Is there a 1% among artists?, Absolutely. Very few make most of the big sales. It’s a star system geared toward taste-based connoisseurs., What do you do to supplant your income?, I teach high school students. Many artists that I know teach in order to support their work., What do you do to keep from being just another person with an opinion? If you are in a similar boat as artists that you know, how do you support your views?, I’ve donated work to ,, ,, ,, a group called , who is working to get a living wage for artists., What advice do you have for artists?, What’s your goal? Do you want to be successful in the commercial system? Do you want time to make work? To exhibit your work?,Figure out what your ideal level of success is., What’s your ideal level of success?, To be able to continue making work and talk about the art world., You have a reputation as someone who bites the hand that feeds him. Tell me this, is the hand tastier than what’s being offered?, [laughs] Well, the 1% has particularly soft hands. I’ve nibbled on a pinky here and there and it’s very tender. Ask me that again when I make it to the tenderloin section.,We talked a few more minutes before he had to run back inside to play ringmaster of the 12 hour circus. This was a wholeheartedly public access affair, complete with odd transitions, someone constantly tweaking the camera angles and vinyl records providing the soundtrack., ,“YOU’RE SCARED TO ANSWER MY QUESTION!” Jonathan Grossmalerman thundered at James Kalm on a couch.,“We don’t want pledges, we want hard cash!” Kalm responed as a phone number flashed across the bottom of the broadcast.,I stayed for a bit sipping on Miller High Life and charging my electronic cigarette. What ran through my mind was not answering questions. It was asking them. I don’t know if we are too scared to ask questions of people. It seems ridiculous to not ask what this actually accomplished, we should all be aware of the madness by now.,Yet, had this not happened, with all of its awkwardness and sweaty foreheads, I don’t know that I would have ever written anything containing the phrase “1%.”,In one moment of satire, Christian Viveros-Faune said something that is both perfectly and viscerally true: “The reward of art is intoxication.”, , ,“We were all engaged and hopefully in some way, implicated. I’d like to think that established artists should probably be thinking more broadly about their relationship to the 1% and patronage. You know, my quote about what percent of my patrons are 1% would go way down if I factored in everyone who bought a ,. Probably make the 1% about 5% of my collector base, but that’s if we consider a $20 purchase collecting art.”,-William Powhida,“I’m extremely pleased with the outpouring of support we received. 12 hours straight is a very long time to entertain and I’d really like to thank cocaine for making that possible.,“I’d also like to thank the people who donated the cocaine. And to the bastards who think we’re being facetious about this whole thing. I ask you, if you’re in trouble, I mean really in trouble, like you hit someone with your car. Do you call your poor friend with no connections?,“I didn’t think so.,“Support the 1%. They sometimes buy art. ”,-Jonathan Grossmalerman,Austin Thomas and I sat down before Bushwick Open Studios in her art gallery , to talk about loss and failure. Or so I had planned. I was losing the lease on my space and thought that her story of rebirth and regeneration would be exactly what what I needed to hear.,So we spoke and she interviewed me as much as I interviewed her. She reminded me that failure is one of the most important components to success, and that true community can overtake conformity., I never considered myself a gallerist at the time. What I was doing was an extension of my artwork. Pocket Utopia in Bushwick was run like a salon space, it was only open on Saturdays and Sundays, we had artist residencies, exhibitions, and talks. So I think that giving it the title of a gallery, may be giving me too much credit [laughs]., So what did you call what you were doing?, It was really a place to expand my own ideas on what running a social space meant. We didn’t really sell work either. The work we did show included things like Andrew Hurst doing a , drilling up through the floor from the basement. There were a lot of performances and an exploration of ideas more than anything else.,The current iteration of Pocket Utopia is also an exploration of ideas, but it’s a deepening of the understanding that started there., Where was your artwork developmentally, before Pocket Utopia?, I had been building a lot of social structures. Things like benches, tables, chairs, for people to sit on and communicate with each other. They were hard structures that I made primarily at a woodshop in Bushwick.,I thought that my work was going to move in the direction of furniture. So that’s one reason that I opened Pocket Utopia, to see if I could run a space as an artwork. Which was very different from the idea of running a gallery. Plus it was only open on Saturday and Sunday, I had to work five days a week.,Looking back, it was my vacation house [laughs]., What was it like running an social arts space in Bushwick at that time?, We didn’t know that we were in Bushwick. We laughed one day when someone came in and asked “How does it feel to be the first art gallery in Bushwick?” We laughed because we thought that we were in East Williamsburg.,I knew that it was an artist neighborhood. The relationships between artists grew stronger as Pocket Utopia carried on. Building an arts community was the main byproduct of running it, whether we were in Bushwick or on the border [laughs].,I had a blog and wrote about how artists approached showing their work. I definitely noticed that it was more about the work and not about who you knew. With that knowledge I always tried to keep the focus on the artwork. I learned a lot about what making art meant to me.,The whole experience of having a community of artists to talk to… I had never had that before.,I don’t know what your experience has been, if you moved to Bushwick with your community of artists. Maybe saying “I didn’t have a community.” sounds foreign to you. But I had lived in New York for thirteen years before opening Pocket Utopia, with a studio in Chelsea for ten years, and I never found that I had a group of artists to talk to about making art. And what it felt like, was having a community who had my back through the experience of failure. Sometimes as an artist – failure is the best thing that can happen to you. We can get confused at always being successful or being surrounded by success.,Pocket Utopia had a beginning, middle and end, I had always planned on doing it for two years. Other things were happening, I was advocating that other artists open their own spaces too. I had learned so much about my own practice through having done that, that it seemed like something worth sharing. I don’t know if that’s your experience…, When I moved here, I didn’t know what Bushwick was. I just wanted to live and write in Brooklyn for a while. I realized that there were a lot of artists in my building that I got along with. So we started our space out of their adjacent apartments., And it has the downstairs right?, Yes they are both duplex apartments., Right… That’s where I saw the work that I liked. It was during Jason’s latest Beat Nite., What were people telling you about your space. And were you aware of what people were writing about Pocket Utopia?, In what sense?, On Edward Winkleman’s blog in 2007 he , that your approach would be the new mould for art galleries. That is, artist-run and artist-friendly., That’s interesting… The funny thing is that that’s not far off the mark from what happened in Bushwick. I mean, here we are on the eve of Bushwick opening up, and there’s over 500 spaces advertised. That’s incredible.,I’m , a show in Sharon Butler’s studio for ,. It feels good to still be involved in the neighborhood. I can nourish it, it can nourish me.,It’s great that artists move there and think about community. And it seems to be the main reason artists cite for moving there. It’s great to find that ideas can manifest so quickly.,That quote from Winkleman is as , as it was then. There is a lot of opportunity to do things, show things, write about things. It seems like there is a nurturing community in which you can show what you do with a lot of freedom.,The dialogue is moving forward. That part never stopped. I started with a few goals in mind. One was to run it for two years, the other was to do it as artpiece. Afterwards, I wanted to run with the idea of Pocket Utopia without a space.,We’re artists, we add and subtract things., What was the transition like from closing your space and going out on that limb, of trying to carry the idea forward, to where you are now?, I never thought that I was going to reopen. Immediately after it closed people started asking me to do things. I worked a lot with Jason Andrew of , and he runs one of the most collaboration-minded organizations around.,We worked together to put on , in Rouses Point, one year after I closed the space. So that was 2010., How did you like being in Rouses Point after having been in the city for so long?, I think that it was good for everybody. It was ten days. A lot of people came and it seemed to have a strengthening effect on the community. I love how Bushwick is this ever changing landscape right in the middle of the city. But that ten days was good for all involved I think. Sorry you couldn’t make it., I am too in retrospect. But I had no idea about it at the time., How has it been for you running 950 Hart?, It’s been a lot of fun. Definitely the best two years of my life. But I also learned more doing this than I ever did at school., I feel the same way about Pocket Utopia. It’s been a great time in my life and it was worth several Masters Degrees based on what I learned. But the community that came out of it had the most lasting impact. The friendships, collaborations, the spaces that opened and have grown since then. Art should have a firm foot in community. We should support each other.,My wish would be for that collaborative community to continue. I think that it will, it’s been proven to work. On that note I look forward to collaborating with you in the future., ,I locked my bike on one of those somewhat desolate, spacious street corners under the JMZ, at Broadway and Willoughby, to visit ,, a very new boutique run by the Yazmin Colon. Yazmin was wearing a pink top and blue cardigan, and her enthusiasm and positive nature were gleaming just as bright as the parrot pendent dangling from her necklace. This is her first boutique, and you could never tell by the looks of the room.,“The most expensive things I have in here are those chains, they’re $30 each. A friend of mine saw those, and said ‘I just bought those somewhere else for $50!’ I don’t want to make a huge profit. I just want to cover my costs and then a little bit. I feel like we’re at a point right now where we are in a recession and rent is really high, but we still need to look good!”,Jazzabelss is tastefully organized and speckled with adorable, affordable jewelry and clothing for women and men of any age. Yazmin is in the process of acquiring plus-size clothing too.,Yazmin told me all about her 12 year old son Johnny, and how his classmates come into the boutique sometimes to hang out.,“I want the young kids around here to be doing something productive with their time, to keep them off the streets. I’ll tell some of them that if they finish school with A’s and B’s they’ll get a package of jewelry for free as a gift. And this collection here, these are little lady bells, for the younger girls. Sometimes I see them wearing jewelry or clothes that they’re just too young for, like huge hoop earrings, and I don’t like it. I want them to feel grown up and mature like their older sisters, but still look like the cute, young girls that they are.”,Aside from selling all kinds of jewelry that are stylish and will  never go out of style, Yazmin told me about all of her huge plans to open up a storefront in Brooklyn, a shop in Florida for her sisters to run, the jewelry parties she already facilitates, events she wishes to hold like block parties, participation in flea markets, and donating jewelry and clothing to organizations benefiting women and under-privileged children.,“I want my boyfriend to get a permit, we want to shut the street down and have a block party. I’d love to do it one weekend from Broadway to Bushwick Ave., then the next weekend from Bushwick Ave. to Evergreen, then the next, Evergreen to Central. Just get everyone together so we can all meet each other and maybe help one another out.”,Community, not competition, seemed to be one of the most important things to Yazmin regarding her business. We spoke about how so many people in New York tend to compete with one another for profits and for reputability, but that’s not what Jazzabelss is about.,[box], ,[/box],On Sunday afternoon, I was strolling through the artist studio giant, 1717 Troutman building. This condense #BOS2012 experience made me realize that actually I keep hearing and saying the same things on and on. “The L train is finally running.” “It’s SO much bigger this year.” “I went to the church, I am so hung over.” I started to record, and this is what came out of it…, ","

" once told me she can’t just organize a regular art show. “I just can’t…” Julie has been largely involved with the artistic community in Bushwick for a couple of years now, and she had organized and curated several notable art events. At AIRPLANE she created durational experiment , she made a bunch of painters work and exhibit their work , at Camel Art Space; and for BOS2011, she organized nights of collaborative drawings and showed the results at ,.,Neither this year did Julie fail to come up with an interesting, community driven concept. She invited a dozen artists she has never met in person, but she has been in vivid contact through social media and art blogs. Many of them came from over seas, just to meet energetic Julie Torres and the rest of the group of abstract painters. They flew in their work, but they also participated in a collaborative drawing night with the Bushwick artist held at Hyperallergic HQ. The show titled , at a pop up location at Starr and Wycoff, The Coin Locker featured all of these works, and certainly belonged to the most interesting shows during BOS2012. The works in the show were beautiful, colorful abstract paintings that furthermore reflected the energy and friendship, pure joy of being and creating together in Bushwick…, ,Shortly before the opening night, I asked Julie a couple of questions about the show and her friendly folks., ,
-Michael Kronenberg,The thing that struck me as I wandered from place to place during Bushwick Open Studios was the field day Freudian psychologists would have with the percolating ego in every direction. Some obvious, some subtle, some well-intentioned, some well-executed and some none of the above.,Let’s start with the low hanging fruit as many of us are still holding on to our printed maps. It was large, as Jason Andrew pointed out it was almost the size of the New York Times. There were over 500 studios and galleries this weekend.,“The size is warranted.”,That was my first thought. Until I looked inside.,Something had gone awry with the design. The first page made sense, even if it was a tad sloppy. My only critique would be to have limited the existing text to one page. Following that were two pages filled with what looked like a whole bunch of nothing, two full pages promoting “Seeking Spaces” and several pages of promotion.,Finally a map appears. This is what many will see first when they arrive off of the L train at the Morgan Stop and it’s telling them that four air-conditioned stops ago is where the weekend began. Except for many of them the weekend began at No Name. Which is to say 56 Bogart.,After you make your way into the building a , of art madness ensues. Everyone is talking about everything. There are four floors and a basement. You kind of want to take your clothes off. The galleries on the first floor stop you from going through with it. But you kind of want to all weekend. The older gallery directors are wiry and spry. You can feel them reflecting a lot of energy, they are usually artists themselves. The younger gallery directors are bursting with similar energy. The world has changed in a generative way and they are all on the forefront of defining a new American culture., is filming a Bollywood Soap Opera with several of Emtee’s alter egos. , is considering his printmaking business with you. Marco Antonini will talk you through ,’s maze of videos. , will draw you to C.C.C.P. by both of you haven taken a chance. , will explain that life is fairly simple to complicate.,Once you’ve talked to a few people and get a sense of where to go, you may have spent two to three hours in 56 Bogart. So you might wander down to 117 Grattan where Austin Thomas had , a show in Sharon Butler’s new studio. Good pieces by Larry Greenberg were found here. I spoke with a friend for a few moments and then wandered around the room, three drawings of incense smoke stood out for the artist’s choice of color. , studio was Jae Song showing dual projections of a conversation between reflections. A building with open spaces on each floor, this will become de rigueur for your explorations.,Next stop seems to be Brooklyn Fireproof. Off the top of my head , , and , were hosting people. The bar was ready for happy hour and the chefs were preparing to enter their zone.,The serendipity of curiosity worked well this weekend. If you’ve stepped into the unexpected places on your route then you’re starting to get a sense of how many artists are in this neighborhood. If you think about how much energy is going in to every single thing to make this happen, the map fades away and you are on your way.,You arrive at , on 566 Johnson. First of all there is the gallery itself. Deborah Brown made a huge leap in the past year. It felt like the world she painted became less romantic and more urgent. The landscapes matured in the right way and devolved in sublime manners. Looking at the card table makes you realize that her projects are all over. Remember to congratulate Ashley Zelinskie on her curation of this excellent show., is exhibiting the “Vegan Pizza Party” and the title piece is like a sculpture of a flashing .gif file. Turn around , has taken pictures of the way a computer might see you. The studios around are fun and full of different kinds of approaches to art from ,’s wooden bones on canvas to ,’s tasteful resin on canvas works. This building is sunny and the name reflects what it feels like.,There’s the Onderdonk House up the road on Flushing. The , is in the expansive backyard. You can get a , of the skyline from the top of the hill and remember that you’re in New York City. There’s a home at the bottom of the hill built in 1709 where a band called , is the real live session band for an ensemble of performances that can include you.,Head to 1717 Troutman for a wild session of studio hopping. Glass portraits, video, music, and paintings to say the least. Don’t forget to swing into galleries , and ,. It was my first time in the building and I felt it. There was good energy touched with enough anarchy and bohemianism to keep the galleries from resting on their laurels. By the way, I’ve seen Rob de Oude’s , before, but I was blown away by the large pieces in his and Enrico Gomez’s shared studio. There was a wall , of the simultaneously-linear-and-swirling pieces.,From there I went to Wyckoff Avenue. If you’re hungry there are two good options: wait for a table at the Northeast Kingdom or wait at the tortilla factory and restaurant. Afterwards, it may be time for an iced coffee. Just to top off the great weather (including the quick rain shower on Sunday) stop by the , where , and , were set up on the sidewalk doling out coffee and water. If you go inside have a Grasshopper.,There is a studio belonging to an interesting artist named ,. His painted canvases hung like shawls without a mannequin. This place reminded me of why it’s good to talk to the artist. He made these pieces to be worn, there was a look book, and there were canvases stitched into abstract figures of what it would look like to wear them.,Down to , for original collages of Pass Kontrol posters by Oliver Ralli. Two that stuck out were a , imagined conversation and a “Cut a hit record with Pass Kontrol” flier from Bushwick Open Studios past.,If you were even , about Bushwick art before the weekend began, , show it was hard to maintain that irony.,When I wasn’t running around I was around the corner at my space , for our final gallery exhibition. We made a lot of new friends, sold some prints and wrote the showing artist’s names on the wall.,Down to Starr Street and stop at quite a few places along the way. The first stop was the huge warehouse with Julie Torres’s , show ALLTOGETHERNOW and another several rooms of art. I could not figure out who was behind each room but there was always something around the corner. Mind your eyes and loose clothing; sculptures are coming out of the wall. From there it was off to the building that houses the Bushwick Starr. A collective that showed work featuring , and sculptures made with tenacity out of milk cartons and canvas. I even spotted a former roommate in one of the photographs. I recognized him looking right at home naked in the midst of a throng of moving people.,I stopped at Olivia Swisher’s home. She stood at the , with the door wide open when I walked in. I was puzzled. She offered me a beer and a series of poems by Chiara Di Lello written on eggs and milk cartons and packages of butter. I read everything in her fridge.,On ,, that was a name game and many people fell for it hook, line and sinker. But let me say that I enjoyed visiting ,, ,, ,, and ,’s booth in that order. Norte Maar’s booth had a , that summed up everything that I felt: “I am having , a good summer.”,Up to Wilson, past , and ,. Two drinking spots with unique flavors that both appeal to me. I stopped at Storefront Bushwick to see what was happening. In the project space I saw celestial patterns by , and two new pieces by ,. This made me reflective as one of his older, angular pieces hung in my gallery. He is cornering his style, this is a part of the artist’s hunt.,From there I went to the arena that spoke to me more than anything else this weekend. It began in ,. First of all, Chris Harding puts on some of the best new exhibitions in this city. This show was no exception. David Pappaceno’s sculptures were arranged to give you a center of gravity and the bases were excellently arranged. The wall was a mind warp of colorful patterns and frames enclosing drawings similar to the sculptures. And don’t miss the paintings in the next room. Influences that are maturing shine through the originality of the compositions., Don Pablo Pedro sat cross legged and conducted a court of Bacchus. His work is quite good. I hope that you didn’t miss the Dirty Little Cunt.,Next door I found myself in awe of Jim Herbert’s enormous paintings. I climbed to the second level for a different perspective. I can’t wait to see what he unveils for the next solo show. These pieces need light and their own company.,From there you’ll stroll up to Bush Gardens for a view of ,’s “Charting the Not” curated by Paul D’Agostino. Here you’ll run into Austin Thomas’s work and Gili Levy’s for the fourth or fifth time. Next door is Tim Kent’s studio. There was a piece entitled “,” made with charcoal and paper that I had been wanting to see for a long time. This studio did not disappoint. It’s hard to appreciate the masterful technique of his paintings of European Homes online. It’s instant gratification in person.,After all of that, I was a bit tired and went home to nurse a whiskey bottle and feel good about the world.,If the trend continues I’ll have to be fitter than Jason Andrew and his dog , to see everything next year. In the meantime I’m keeping my eye on you Bushwick. Stay classy.,Last Saturday, back at ,, Body Actualized Center, we rang in (late) Spring with a Cosmic evening full of, oh you know, the usual assortment of lovely and random plethora of BAC goodies. Marshmellows, blacklights, UV bouquets, a rainforest installation, kale chips, live DJing, light/laser show from Aurora of ,, and always good vibes.,The evening doubled as a goodbye celebration for BAC’s most (in)famous yoga instructor and good-hearted core, Amy Jenkins, who gave a small speech describing the happiness of her community, the power of yoga, and her passion for being a woman! (I think her exact words were “I’m thankful I have a pussy!” - a statement met with great applause.) You go girl, and good luck beyond Bushwick’s factory skyline…,Not to worry! Body Actualized Center, , and with a ,, is better than ever and features a full roster of daily yoga events and cosmic yoga on Sundays. We’ll keep you posted on their upcoming glowtastic parties, which so far seem to be bimonthly., ,[box],[/box],Mild hysteria is okay. A panic attack here and there is also fine. The fact that not everything is , the way you planned doesn’t matter in the end. As long as the air bubble in your level is strictly between two lines you are fine (and if it’s slightly off, you can always blame it on crooked Bushwick floors). The feelings of panic and chaos, and expectations belong to the Bushwick Open Studio experience; they make us feel the festival spirit.  Once the art is hanging, the beer is cold in the fridge, the cards are printed, everything will be just fine…,After our selection of top 15 studios not to be missed off ,, we are moving to Jefferson!, ,Artist Julie Torres is not only known for her energetic abstract paintings, but also for organizing some of the most original art events in Bushwick and beyond. This year, Julie Torres invited to Bushwick 11 artists from across the country and abroad to participate in a collaborative show. In a very contemporary fashion, Julie met this group of abstract painters on the internet and through interaction on art blogs and social media. They have brought their own work, as well as they have collaborated on pieces with Bushwick artists. All this work will be exhibited at The Coin Locker on 234 Starr St. The show opens on Friday night!,Jules de Balincourt, an ultra-successful Bushwick artist of French origin is hosting the first art fair in Bushwick right there in his studio, aka Starr Space.  He invited 11 Bushwick (and Ridgewood) galleries to participate, and it is looking pretty good. After the shout out from NY Times, we are sure that the crowds are on the way! The opening reception is on Saturday, 7-9pm.,Once on Starr St., take a peek at The Bushwick Starr. This iconic Bushwick black box theater will be hosting The Bushwack Series, an annual performance festival devoted to the development of new work within the neighborhood of Bushwick.,At Diana H. Jones Senior Center you can experience a little different BOS… Bushwick photographer Daryl-Ann Saunders created a series of portraits of long time Bushwick residents aspiring to create another platform for discussion between “old” and “new” Bushwick.,In the live and work space of Amy Lincoln and Kevin Curran on Wycoff Ave, you will see sculpture by Sarah Kohn and Kevin Curran, paintings by Caetlynn Booth and Amy Lincoln.,In the famous studio building at 1717 Troutman on the Bushwick/Ridgewood boarder, don’t miss the new and beautiful gallery, Parallel Art Space, committed ”to showcase exceptional visual art.” Parallel will present Same Same But Different, a selection of works from artists Jay Gaskill, Fabian G. Tabibian and Amanda Valdez, who form the exhibition collective of the same name. The opening reception is on Friday, 6-9pm.,Deborah Brown is widely known in Bushwick and beyond, mostly through her curatorial activities and community involvement, so it’s a little surprising that some Bushwickians don’t know her work. Deborah Brown is an exceptional painter whose solo show opens on Saturday from 7-10pm at the Active Space. Deborah’s pieces are inspired by industrial landscape of Bushwick and vary from very large to small paintings.

This young ambitious artist and curator is certainly someone to watch out for!,Right next to Jen Jones is Theresa Daddezio.

It’s on Friday!,At Body Actualized Center they have have a collaboration between visual stimuli and the confines of being in utero going on…,Meg Lipke’s painting remind us of illustrations in old timey children’s books. They are gentle and dreamy. Go get lost in her world behind the Northeast Kingdom., , , , ,The video game heroes. The animated gif fairy tale couple. Very likely the coolest people of the fashion world right now. Visionaries and playful internet kids who won a Willy Wonka ticket to do whatever they like! And hell, they are awesome at it. ,.,Reed+Rader is Pamela Reed and Matthew Rader. With a background in photography, Reed and Rader derive their inspiration from technology, internet, video games and augumented reality. This artist couple have created their own unique visual language by combining photography and animation. It’s not a surprise that Reed+Rader’s “living photographs” or animated gifs have been met with an overwhelming response from the fashion and art world.

You’ll have a great chance to meet them in person this Saturday at the opening of ,, a project of our artsy sister Internet-based ,. Matthew will be the one wearing a pizza outfit!,We asked Reed+Rader a couple of questions….,
In late 2007, early 2008 we decided to stop doing still images and explore this territory of moving images that we refer to as photo animations or, just simply, gifs. Instead of just dumping old ideas online, it made sense to us being computer-and-internet-obsessed to make the work take advantage of that emerging venue. We saw that many magazines weren’t taking advantage of the web and we wanted to help push them over the cliff and carve out a new market.,We use fashion as a way to dress characters in stories we create. We really love the more outgoing styles of clothing that take more risks as it really helps to tell more about these characters. We work very hand in hand with stylists on projects to make sure the story is being told as we imagine.,Definitely. When we do something outside of an editorial or commercial job, there’s a lot less rules and not as many hands in the cookie jar, so we take more risks and try new things. We feel like with the gallery work we can just do it because we want to,  no other reasons.,We always say this and it’s cliché but it’s like the same person with 4 hands and 2 brains. We’ve been working together and as a couple for close to 10 years and there’s probably only a handful of days we haven’t seen each other so we know each other pretty well. Working in a team as a couple allows you to talk ideas anytime, it’s not uncommon that we are in bed at 5AM talking about ideas because someone woke up with a thought and needs to share it. With that said, it’s also impossible to separate Pamela + Matthew from Reed + Rader so work never shuts off. If we have to divide tasks, Matthew is stronger at programming and technicals and Pamela is stronger at general art direction and production. But it really is a team effort and nothing is ever done before we both agree on it.,We love Friends With You. They’ve been a favorite for years and most recently we both worked on the Beck’s Green Box Project.  The Green Box was an exciting project to be involved with and we got to travel to Berlin to not only see our project live,  but we saw Friends With You as well. We also are astounded by Memo Akten’s mad scientist tech-wizardry and adore Rachel Maclean.,Animated gifs are old, but very new at the same time. They are such an easy way to share moving content so it makes sense to make images move. Online you can make clothing move, have sound, have interactivity. These are all things we hope that online magazines take advantage of as it’s the platform they are publishing on. Whatever the future holds, we’ll always look back on GIFs as one of the internet’s first true visual art forms.,We have a 500 square foot garden on the roof, some people refer to it as a farm. We spend many hours there and lots of hard work, but it’s the best time of the day to go up there and just escape from the city stress and unwind. It really does feel like another place when you’re up there, on your knees, planting corn seeds. We grow broccoli, tomatoes, peppers, corn, sugar snap peas, strawberries, onions, kale, spinach, green beans, carrots, watermelon, pumpkins, potatoes. We grow a lot! It’s lots of fun, we love it., , is Dominican, a poet, a gypsy cab driver and a native of Bushwick, Brooklyn. He identifies with the gentrifying artists who’ve flocked to the area in the last decade and the Hispanic locals with whom he grew up when Bushwick was better known for its crime rate than its hot new galleries.,Flako’s documentary, , (Listen! For my Dear Brooklyn), is comprised of a series of poems aimed at sparking a dialogue about Bushwick’s transformation.,“My neighborhood right now has a lot of people that picking sides,” Flako says. “Where to hang out, where to go.

In her thirties, she is pretty, charismatic, lively and has so much to say. “I was telling them about Bushwick in the ’70s and ’80s, after the fireward and during the crack epidemics… All these burned buildings became crack houses…That’s where we grew up.”,Vanessa Martir grew up in Bushwick under rather dramatic circumstances. “I had two moms,” Vanessa explains growing up with lesbian parents. “That was ’70s and ’80s, New York…The climate was just very homophobic.” Additionally, her mother was mentally ill. As a child Vanessa believed that she ought be quiet about her personal and family life, which had devastating consequences. At just six years old, Vanessa was molested by a close family friend. Feeling ashamed and guilty, she kept silent about this until the age of 29. “That man in the window molested me,” Vanessa says, pointing at an old man at Meryl Meisler’s photograph.,“This picture shows how many layers life has,” Meryl Meisler comments about the photograph she took back in the ’80s on Bushwick’s Palmetto Street. The photo is titled , and captures a group of children playing on the street, a couple of women talking and an old man leaning from the window. Meryl says that she thought this photograph was happy…,Vanessa Martir, today a published author has been working on a memoir about her childhood in Bushwick. When she was 13, she participated in a program for talented and gifted children, and left Bushwick for a boarding school in Massachusetts.,“Nobody,” Vanessa answered, when I asked who else from Bushwick she knew who participated in this kind of program. Later on, Vanessa graduated from Columbia University, and now she teaches creative writing at CUNY and other institutions.,Meryl Meisler used to work as an art teacher at a school in Bushwick. She used to carry an inexpensive plastic point and shoot pocket camera, and take hundreds of photos of street life on her way to and back from school. The photographs of Bushwick in the 1980s by Meryl Meisler are an invaluable material of life in what used to be one of the most dangerous parts of the city.,Bushwick after the New York Blackout in 1977 wasn’t exactly a safe or pretty place to raise children, but yet Meryl’s photographs from the time are playful, full of life and happiness.,In December 2011, Soho Photo Gallery invited Meryl Meisler to show her Bushwick photographs in a solo exhibition titled ,Bushwick Daily’s contributor Shannon Firth wrote an article and created an audio slideshow about the exhibition. Vanessa Martir read the article and recognized herself in one of the photographs. Working on a memoir and processing events of her childhood in Bushwick, she is certain that it wasn’t just an accident that brought her together with Meryl Meisler.,For their collaborative art show in Bushwick, Vanessa went through hundreds of Meryl’s photographs, selected the ones that will be on display at The Living Gallery and wrote narratives based on her childhood memories. “Despite everything, life was happening in Bushwick. People were falling in love; children were playing in the ruins… ”, , ,We are taking it by subway stops.

Arts in Bushwick website shows 542 registered locations, which is ,. However, there is no need to panic! Whether you are actively participating or just visiting, we understand that you want to have the most of the weekend. Here is 5 ways how to navigate through the large number of the locations:, ,Every BOS veteran knows that one of the most common ways of getting around during BOS, is to pick up a brochure/map that Arts in Bushwick have been producing for the event annually.   Lucia Rollow (BOS 2012 co-lead) writes in her email this morning that the maps are ready to be picked up in stacks at the following locations:,Lucia’s House: 385 Troutman St #301, if the buzzer doesn’t work call 917-693-5719,Bushwick Print Lab: 1717 Troutman #204,Parallel Art Space: 1717 Troutman #220,Spread Art: 104 Meserole St,Outpost Artist Resources: 16-65 Norman St,While last year, the map looked more like a glossy MoMA brochure, this year the map resembles a regular newspaper. We welcome this change because of the more ecological and economical paper, and also because it’s simply more Bushwick. The design is pretty and overall we like the pink color.  Flipping through “a newspaper” should bring easier orientation in the large number of events, but unfortunately it doesn’t. As pretty as the design is, the map is not very user friendly. The neighborhood is divided into six zones, which is a good idea, but the paper doesn’t contain a summary of the zones nor table of contents. Very randomly, there is a map of the entire BOS (without the zone division) on page 53 between chapter Zone 3 and 4.,Among rather funny highlights belongs the fact that 56 Bogart building, , is called “No Name” in the paper, because the creators of the brochure didn’t know that the building is commonly referred to as 56 Bogart. The brochure contains a number of underused pages, which are either blank or randomly say “Boswijk” or display BOS logo. We strongly believe that these pages should have been used as table of contents or maps serving better general orientation., , , , ,Arts in Bushwick have created a , to help us navigate through festival Bushwick. This is a great idea, and we highly recommend downloading it and rely on the app rather than on the printed map. Just a little heads up, in case you own what we like to refer to as to ,, the app won’t work. BOS app works only on iPhone 3GS and higher., ,A number of publications, including , will be assembling their guides and lists of events not to be missed. This is a great way of not missing really good stuff and of relying on professional opinion of your favorite blogs and other Bushwick art geeks., ,You can instantly know and/or share what’s going on in Bushwick if you follow hashtag , on Twitter. Participating art spaces and studios are tweeting short blurbs and images. We created a widget to filter the tweets containing hashtag #BOS2012 and placed it in our right side bar. Is something totally worth it? Tweet it to your peers!, ,It is nice to plan BOS really well, and to be on the schedule, but don’t over-plan things because you might miss on the serendipitous encounter and experiences that plain exploring brings… We promise that you will have great time in any case (maybe even the best time), if you just randomly visit houses, studio buildings and galleries by just following the BOS signs all around our pigeon town during the weekend., , , , ,Before leaving for brunch at AIRPLANE, the only details provided to me were that the chefs are amazing and they were playing host to ,. I arrived late and found myself in good company with the bartender and co-founder of , Liz Atzberger. She offered me a shot of a small batch bourbon: Corsair Triple Smoke. I carried my sipping whiskey and walked around the sun drenched backyard to get a feel from the guests on how the event went.,I could overhear people talking under floppy hats about the amuse-bouche, a Deviled Egg Trio paired with a Bloody Mary Infusion made from heirloom tomatoes. The other dish that had people abuzz was a surprise Honey-Ricotta Souffle that came out as the first tantalizing course.,Chef Michael Kogan, Sous Chef Lars Kremer, Sommelier John Avelluto, the Dumbwaiter Paul D’Agostino, and a committed group of volunteers and friends fielded many appreciative comments and compliments to the chef. A special appreciation is in order to the Dumbwaiter for holding an umbrella up against the sun.,Upon sampling the second and third courses I could identify with the excited tongues and full bellies. A slow cooked egg en cocotte and flavorful hangar steak stood out above the rest. As though the artisan whiskey wasn’t enough to sate my appetite, it blended perfectly with the hangar steak that must have been carefully marinated to achieve its tenderness., ,As the sun set I sat with Liz, Lars, Chef Mike, and John to ask about the event and how it began., , We had a few dinner events here before officially opening the gallery. As a way of solidifying our dinner aesthetic, if you will., , Food is something I’ve always wanted to have here. I usually make a specialty snack for the openings. Liz makes a signature drink for the shows., , I’ve been in food service for most of my life. I worked with my father in Little Italy bussing tables for extra money when I was a kid. After a while, he opened two restaurants and I worked with him to pay for college. Now I own a wine bar [,] and Chef Mike [they met as undergrads at Brooklyn College] is our consulting chef there. Lars and I were introduced to each other by Paul D’Agostino due to our mutual participation in the visual arts and food culture and so we all worked together for a few months to put this on., , This seems like a large production, how did you go about it?, , The planning for this event was so far in advance that the production went as smoothly as possible. The event and menu was a way to break through social media interaction. We based the menu on how people reacted to five different questions and got a variety of answers.,From that initial feedback, Chef Mike and John created the menu and wine pairings., , As each course went out, I posted it on the event page on Facebook. They had no idea what they were getting until it came out. We were all able to react in real time., , People were checking the page throughout the meal. As well as posting their own pictures of the food as it came out., , They said it felt a little awkward at first, being on their phone at the table, but it really caught on and that was an enjoyable part of it too., , That was basically the point though. Getting the feedback in real time and, for John and myself, approaching it like an art project. People were asking me questions as it went on., , Did you get to answer the questions?, , Yes but not as often as I would have liked. I was more preoccupied with preparing the next dish. I had Lars backing me so I had a few moments to interact. It was fun., What were the reactions to the initial questions like?, , I was looking forward to the answers that would give me room to play around with the menu. As a chef, I wanted to make sure that everyone left happy., , From an artistic perspective, you do look forward to throwing some curveballs., , People got into it. I had an intense conversation with Larry Greenberg about this dinner, and then I met him here for the first time. That was what we were striving for, the online interactions becoming real interactions., , That and having great food and drinks. It feels like a success when everyone leaves with a full belly and a smile., , And roses., ,[box],[/box]","

" , ,With Bushwick Open Studios pushing into its seventh year of existence, I decided to look into statistics a little bit and create a few drawings documenting the growth of the number of participants since its inception. While a more extensive history of BOS was ,, these drawings serve as a visual cue to how quickly this community-run project has become a staple in the Bushwick summer. With a whole lot of help from the BOS volunteer team, I approximated the number of registered shows for each event in years past. A “show” can be a registered gallery, studio building, or artist studio, so these estimated numbers do not necessarily represent how many individual artists have participated. That number is always significantly higher than what’s listed here. This year, now that registration is complete, ,.,I should also mention that although 2006 is the earliest year represented in the drawings below, there was an event in 2005 called , (BAP), which was a one-day, fully curated event, included “18+ hours of art installations, electronic music, indie rock, VJs, DJs, video art, film, dance, and street art occurring simultaneously in an industrial park located in Bushwick.” The term Bushwick Open Studios was coined for an event in October of 2006. And here’s a bit of trivia: ,*The trivia answer: 50% of them.,Check out participating artists, venues, and events , and the many blog posts profiling artists and locations ,Have you noticed that Bushwick has been suspiciously silent lately? That’s because the neighborhood is bracing itself for the biggest event of the year. Yes, Bushwick is gearing up for the annual , on the first weekend on June! The pigeon keepers from all over Bushwick will meet at Maria Hernandez Park, with their pigeon flocks on a leash early morning on June 1. They will release their pigeons from the leash with an uneasy task: to fly around the planet Earth and bring back artifacts from every continent. The first flock to return wins the eternal glory!*,However, despite the glorious , being in preparation, some brave Bushwickians set themselves to organize awesome events for us even this week. Here is 5 coolest ones!,With all the DIY charm that belongs to an apartment gallery, luckily still not forgotten in Bushwick, Centotto’s founder Paul D’Agostino will open the doors to his home, gallery and heart in a friendly manner, nonchalantly presenting his curatorial mastery. , will feature 4 brilliant artists: Austin Thomas, Meg Lipke, Josh Willis and Gili Levy, and will remain open also for the subsequent weekend of Pigeon Flight Parade.,It’s Memorial Day weekend, and the weather looks promising! David Teller of BirdDog who is getting ready to open his very own music venue off Mogan L stop, is throwing an amazing rooftop party with bands (Not Blood, Paint; Monogold, and more), booze and kiddie pools. Sounds terrific? It will sound even better when we tell you it’s free!,Secret Project Robot is one of the coolest venues in Bushwick, and we love it’s quirkiness and DIYness. On Saturday they are inviting you to their outdoor yard party with bands (Call of the Wild; Animals; Black Dice), BBQ and watermelon drinks.,Microscope similarly like Centotto belongs to the good kids who are ready for Pigeon Fly Parade already one week before and are inviting you to escape the madness and simply enjoy their opening. The exhibition will feature Polaroids by Emma Bee Bernstein (curated by Phong Bui). And we simply want to see them!,Shea Stadium is organizing many concerts, which is making the entire Bushwick very happy. On Friday they will present something exceptionally good. Amen Dunes, Gary War, Highlife and Woodman will play to make you jump and tune in to the Memorial Weekend atmosphere.  $8 will get you in!, , , , , ,*It’s a total lie ,  Bushwick is gearing up for Bushwick Open Studios!!, ,A pleasantly sized crowd – not too small, but not too big either – was chilling in front of ,, a dive bar on the corner of Broadway and Dodworth. It was after 10pm. “The concerts haven’t started yet,” someone said in the crowd.  After a frantic bike ride and an even more frantic hunt for a suitable pole to lock my blue Myata, it was great not to be late for once. Broadway on Saturday night underneath the subway tracks looks like a different planet. The emptiness of the usually busy street was replaced by silence, which was only occasionally interrupted by the laughter of a group of dressed-to-impress transvestites or the far away beat of salsa coming from someone’s basement. ,, my homie and , star, was the tallest and smoking like chimney. Maybe a little nervous? He was about to DJ with the hip hop trio ,.,With a guitar on her back, Gillian Visco, dressed in black, slim and charismatic as always approached from the darkness. A member of ,, pressed her lips firmly when she told me that John Swanson, their drummer, left them and moved to Austin, TX. “He went to SXSW, and decided to stay in Austin…” Gillian said almost as if she couldn’t believe it. Frank Rathbone, another member of this locally super-popular rock ’n’ roll band looked a bit sad too.  They were going to play only as a duo switching between the guitar and the drums. “We’re not ready to replace John yet,” Gillian said, and I swear it seemed like she was going through a break up. “The three of us, we had something special, a strong musical bond…”, ,That night Photon played many new songs I haven’t heard yet. Brothers from Another wasn’t a likely match to a rock band, yet it felt so amazing. RG and Nipsy were rapping hard, while Keisha sang emotionally. The night was good. Really good., , ,Five years ago, painter , had an excellent idea. She started a blog dedicated to what she loved the most – painting. , have become one of the most visited and referred to blogs about painting, and if you’re an artist in Bushwick you are likely to know the blog very well. Studio visits, reviews, gallery strolls but also ,, Sharon who teaches art at Eastern Connecticut State University, has been curating the content of her blog with  passion and deep knowledge of an expert.,Great news is that Sharon has recently moved her studio and the HQ of , to 117 Grattan Street, Bushwick, and will celebrate the fifth anniversary of her blog during ,. Sharon has invited , to curate a painting art show in her studio, and from what we saw, the show looks amazing.,Austin Thomas is a legendary character of Bushwick art scene who was among the first people to open a gallery in Bushwick. , closed down in September 2010, and at its former spot you can nowadays find bar ,. , has reopened in collaboration with ,, at Lower East Side, Manhattan in late March 2012.,The art show curated by Austin Thomas is titled ,, and will feature artists Margaret Atkinson, Guy Corriero, Lawrence Greenberg, and Edie Nadelhaft. Here is a little preview (All images by courtesy of Austin Thomas)., , , ,On a rainy day in April, I sat down at , with Laura Braslow. Over too many cups of coffee, , — co-founder of Arts In Bushwick, co-lead of Arts In Bushwick’s community projects team, former co-lead organizer of Bushwick Open Studios and current Organizers Emeritus — detailed her history as a part of Arts in Bushwick. What follows is from that and a few other places, a brief personal history of AiB.,–,In 2005, there was ,, a curated one-day festival of art and music in locations scattered around the Montrose and Morgan L train stops. At the time, Braslow was living in a loft in Bushwick with a number of roommates who shared her desire to be a social entrepreneur. They contacted the organizers of the BAP and expressed their desire to collaborate in the production of their next neighborhood event, and specifically to help organize others in the neighborhood and foster greater community involvement. After the BAP organizers backed out, an email was sent out to the mailing list of interested parties and a few dedicated people — ,, ,, for example— stepped forward to act as co-organizers of the,., ,More people – and an organizational structure – was needed to make Bushwick Open Studios a sustainable community organization. The open, all volunteer, non-hierarchical structure, then, is a matter of both ethics and necessity.,Other Arts in Bushwick events emerged organically. ,, founded by ,, is festival of ,. Founded by ,, , is an interdisciplinary event, exploring the neighborhood as an unfolding collaborative performance enacted in urban space.,For Braslow, the Bushwick Open Studios and other Arts In Bushwick events present a unique organizing opportunity, even as the growing number of participants and viewers each year garners , , ,., ,Two paintings  sized 11″ x 14″ and priced at $12,000 were sold two weeks ago at , (a third similar one is on reserve). One of the many new galleries that have sprung up in the past year at the 56 Bogart building can be rightfully proud. While $12,000 price tag on a painting might not raise many eyebrows in Chelsea, they have shaken the common opinion that big collectors never come to Bushwick.,One of the greatest contemporary artists and collectors in America who wishes to remain anonymous saw the potential in Royce Weatherly’s paintings, and didn’t hesitate a second. “These works are special” says gallery director Peter Hopkins regarding Royce Weatherly’s paintings currently exhibited in a group show titled , through May 28th.,“Everything that we have worked for is “now”. It will either work, or it won’t work but it will happen now,” said Peter Hopkins referring to his predictions that the bigger collectors can and will come to Bushwick. During the panel discussions , held back in January, and more recently this past March at ,, both organized by his gallery, the panelists and the audience alike were mostly skeptical that this would ever happen.,“These sales have helped change Royce’s life, my gallery, and mybe even Bushwick. This one small thing, that moment, everything may have turned on it,” says Peter.,Royce Weatherly’s hand can be compared to Vermeer, and his mind to Matisse. After a 12-year painting hiatus, Royce produced a work that caught the very notable attention of major collectors. What makes Royce’s work so enticing is the arc of time in which he creates a work. Many young Bushwick residents will be middle aged and perhaps have moved on from the neighborhood by the time Royce’s work is “finished,” for a key element in many of his paintings, is age, both in the deliberate fashion his paintings take to produce, but also in the arc of their “completion.”,“In a way, Royce represents the kind of person who Bushwick should theoretically be here to represent,” said Hopkins after talking about this painting as if it were a precious artifact that has been buried for years. “He’s 54-years-old, he’s shown all around the world, but no one could wait for him. I could.”,The paintings that are sparking the most interest however, hang on another wall perpendicular to this piece. We see two paintings of walnuts, one is dark, and yellowing with the years, and the other is bright, painted in the exact same way only lit from an opposite direction. The paintings emphasize the negative space, shadows and light, proving what isn’t there is just as important as what is. The viewer will have to patiently wait for the bright one to also become beautifully dim.,A painting , of the type of lights you might see on a construction site, glowing in a dark space. The lights are painted with such precision that this work can easily be mistaken for a photograph. But like so many works, the mood in this painting is what makes it come to life. The overhead lights are actually the lights that hang in Royce’s basement in New Jersey, where he paints. This is his studio now after his break from painting. The hiatus came from simply the everyday progression of life as the culprit (moving to the suburbs, buying a home, supporting a family, etc.) The painting appears to be created at a time where hope may have been lost. The dark basement is hardly visible beyond the two lights, except for a small shining orb in the distance, just barely illuminating a sliver of a staircase, perhaps revealing a glimmer of hope, a way out., ,Perhaps the somber tone of this painting is what makes the next one in the series so inspiring. , is bright, and simple in its objects but complicated in almost every other way. On a white background filled to the brim with shadows and light, an empty coffee cup lays on its side. It’s beautiful circular geometry is balanced by its dark blue color, and drop of brown liquid leaking subtly at the back. Next to it lays the plastic packaging of a cigarette carton, painted with a delicacy and precision comparable to the way Botticelli painted veils on the Madonna. Both packages are empty, but there is nothing empty or somber about this painting at all. It’s almost joyful in that these two empty objects say something is coming, I’m back, I’m moving.,“I think I’m lucky. Its hard to back and out and come back into it again,” said the artist as he explained what may have sparked creating these paintings after such a long period of time. “Its kind of nerve wracking, you’re not sure if your ideas are any good… But hang onto your ideas and pay attention to what you know.”, ,Nyssa Frank posted a couple of announcements asking Bushwick artists to come to , and hang there their own art on Saturday. “, said the announcements. This community-based exhibition is a project that allows artist to display their work without the limitations that are often a part of getting one’s work into a gallery.,Nyssa, the owner and founder of The Living Gallery clad in a faded tutu and war paint explained that having a gallery has always been a dream of hers. Once the Living Gallery was up and running she began to focus her attention on creating a space that was inclusive. , is indicative of the diverse community living in Bushwick. Nyssa’s idea was to have a show that represents artists’ imaginations and concepts through different mediums. It actually works, running the risk of hanging art that could potentially have been less than gallery worthy didn’t factor in to the end result. The show provides over 25 local artists the ability to publicly display their sculptures, drawings, paintings or whatever you want to call it.,The Living Gallery in all its unconventional splendor has given the community a unique opportunity to promote the flow of ideas and unite people. Good natured Nyssa is on to something here. She loves Bushwick and its inhabitants and has willingly worked to combine the work of her fellow artists into one cohesive exhibit. Inspired by a show that she participated in at , earlier this year where artist could hang their work, Nyssa extended that idea by having anyone participate and continue to contribute to the show while it is on display.,Nyssa is planning on having , a mainstay for the gallery. Every few months there will be a new show with different artists and it will not be limited to studio art. If you play an instrument or can do something that exceeds the coolness of your friends then please come and share it with us at the next , exhibition., , , , ,The lights went off and the tones of Beach House filled the room. “No! Don’t even think about it,” I clenched my teeth to fight the tears. Happy endings always get me. Paul Rome and Roarke Menzies disappeared into darkness, and a deep inhale caused a pleasant warmth that won over the tears.,A literary performance called , has been maturing slowly towards its absolutely fabulous finale at , last week. Both ,, author of the words, and ,, author of the music, were clearly enjoying the stage and the fruit of many months of their work. Last year in April, we saw , on a rainy night at Storefront gallery. Despite how enjoyable and excellent it was, nothing could possibly beat the exceptional literary experience that the black box theater and the refined stories allowed for the last week at The Bushwick Starr…,It is safe to claim that the entire social scene of Bushwick made it to The Bushwick Starr on one of those nights. , was either sold out or very close to selling out every night.,Paul Rome and Roarke Menzies created a unique and a very effective format to interpret a story – a reading with atmospheric music and sounds to enhance the effect of the words. Paul Rome who wrote three stories loosely connected through ‘Calypso’ marginally appearing in each of them, also read two of the stories. , and ,are variations on Roman-Greek mythology, and both deal with love and oscillate between mild cynicism and realization of determinism of one’s fate. This determinism, connections and interdependencies of things and events, creates a meeting point between Paul’s Ancient Greece segment and the contemporary story , interpreted by Roarke Menzies.,Tandem is a story of a guy who lives in New York, goes to Columbia and lives in the East Village. The encounter with fatal love injects the Ancient Greek element into the story, which in my opinion brings Paul’s and Roarke’s reading segments together more than anything else.,Also interesting was how Roarke and Paul alternated on the stage reading parts of the stories. I found it really refreshing; my brain tends to focus better on visual information than on spoken word. This alternating also gave the viewer an opportunity to compare both interpretations. Endearingly humoring his own characters, Paul Rome played the role of the narrator. But Roarke was telling , story. Naturally the story was fictional, but Paul wrote it , Roarke, and Roarke was really believable. Listening to Roarke felt like a game with reality. I couldn’t help but wonder which portion of the story was still fiction, and which part was reality.,The music created by Roarke Menzies placed the viewer exactly where the authors wanted her to be: deeply immersed in the story., provided for a colorful adventure of a three-dimensional narrative, and all it took were two men on a stage to create the magic. That’s art., , ,More images from , on our ,.,Brooklyn is no stranger to television. One of the most hyped and talked about shows of this year, Lena Dunham’s ,, takes place in our beloved borough. However, the show has fallen under scrutiny for being a homogeneous and white representation of an extremely pluralistic area. In episode four, the characters spend time in Bushwick, a predominately Latino neighborhood, but you would never know that from the faces on screen.,Unfortunately, this is not an exception. Mass media has a serious problem when it comes to the depiction of Latinos. They are frequently nowhere to be found in the stories we enjoy in film and on television — and when they are, they’re often negative stereotypes. With that in mind, Yamin Segal and Julia Ahumada Grob took things into their own hands and created ,, a web series that focuses on Latino life in a rapidly changing Bushwick. “East WillyB tells the story of Puerto Rican sports bar owner Willy Jr. as he fights to keep his bar alive in the face of the gentrification of his neighborhood,” says co-creator Julia Ahumada Grob, who also acts in the series.,The , deals with important issues like gentrification, cultural identity, and small business ownership, but it does so with a lighthearted silliness. “It goes beyond being a Latino story, although it is predominately a Latino production. But I think people in other communities can relate to this series on so many other levels”, says Flaco Navaja, who stars in the series as Willy Jr. It was shot on location in Bushwick and South Williamsburg. The cast and crew did it all on their own, with the help of friends and family.,With most of the pilot season completed, the creators headed to LA to look for funding, but they were told they were too early. Not one to take no for an answer, they decided to release it online - in its entirety, on their own. “Latinos are a huge population that is consuming, interacting with, and I think are going to become leaders in, New Media. And we wanted to help be a part of that movement”, says Grob.,It was only natural then that they would take to ,, the crowdfunding darling, to help fund their first full season. They are looking to shoot and release 91 minutes of original content, which they plan to start releasing in September 2012. Their funding goal is $50,000, and they have already broken $15,000, but time is running out. They’re offering many great incentives, including a walk on role, so go check out their pitch video and help support a much-needed series born in Bushwick.,While you’re at it, check out our ,, where we highlight projects from the area we love., ,Despite a rainy Tuesday, there is a reason to smile. The new week in Bushwick unfolded a whole bunch of great events to attend. If you want to know about everything, look at the , here, or if you want to know specifically about the galleries and when are they open, ,. Also we handpicked five of this weeks events that we like the best, and strongly recommend you go!,This week we have a lot of performance art, festival or experimental music and video art, and a BOS benefit!,The Ende Tymes Festival is an annual celebration of noise, experimental music, and video art. The festival is organized thanks to a collaboration of , & ,. The organizers are promising over 40 artists working with street-level avant-garde sound and video (END, Anthony Saunders, or Lussuria etc.),Did you know that Marina Abramovic wanted to open a performance art foundation in Bushwick? In the end she went for Hudson, but it doesn’t mean that we don’t have enough performance art in Buswhick as it is! Friday night should be dedicated to performance art. Microscope Gallery will present ,, performances by Angela Washko & Ann Hirsch. You will see “incredibly misogynistic realms within World of Warcraft” by Angela Washko, and Ann Hirsch will present a completely new piece in which she grapples with her “new” finally developed female body. $6,Grace Exhibition Space is a beautiful large loft space dedicated to performance art. On Friday night, Grace will present Carlos Monroy, Theo Pelmus, Luisa Nobrega and Matthew Silver. Donation of $10 will get you in.,There is a garage on 59 Waterbury Street (corner of Scholes). This garage will be open, free and inviting on Friday night for you to see some excellent performances by Heaven’s Gate, Crown the Invisible, Warcries.,To honor and support all the great work that all volunteer organization Arts in Bushwick is putting toward Bushwick Open Studios, attend their benefit in Sunday evening. It will be traditionally held at Grace Exhibition Space, and for $50 you can raffle yourself a beautiful new art piece by one of the artists who donated their work., , ","

" , ,[quote]This is an incredible place soaked with history, sacred atmosphere and creativity…[/quote],Big crowds of people have been going to the church on the corner of Bushwick Ave and Jefferson St lately. The church has been particularly well attended on Friday and Saturday nights as opposed to Sunday mornings as you might expect…Yeah, you’re guessing correctly.  It’s not a sudden religious devotion of young Bushwickians that brings them there. The church and the schoolhouse have been rented by a mysterious guy named ,…,St. Mark’s Evangelical Lutheran Church and School at 626 Bushwick Avenue was built during 1885-1892. Designed by architect Theobald M. Engelhardt, it has served the Bushwick community for many years. The church building quickly became too small to educate all the children, and so a schoolhouse was set up at the southwest corner of Bushwick Avenue and Jefferson Street [Source: ,].,Moving forward to present day, the church has been vacant for several years now. With the help of  his two friends who wish to remain annonymous, Bobby Redd decided to make the idea of creating a unique art and cultural center in Bushwick a reality. The inaugural art show at Bobby Redd Projects took place in March this year. , curated by Dave Bates featured works of some of the most known Bushwick artists (Ben Godward, Don Pablo Pedro, William Powhida, etc.). The church’s altar was replaced by a stage where bands were rocking it, and in the back you could have have a Tecate. One of everyone’s favorite elements is a confession room/bar constructed by Bushwick artist Andrew Ohanesian. Having a confession room in a lutheran church doesn’t really make sense, but it’s a detail that can be overlooked.,Since their opening in March, Bobby Redd has hosted a wild , party, an eclectic theater/aerial performance ,, and the plans for the near and dear future also look pretty amazing. This Saturday, the bunch around Bobby is building “a giant dome, rigging it with bungees, and drenching you in beer so you can fight to the death.” Yes, the church will be occupied with a ,. The music will be taken care of by ,  and , with special effects by ,.,During ,, the church will be hosting ,, a festival of film, aerials, amazing visual installations, a brunch by Secret Restaurant to live music, and exceptional art performances.  As the website dedicated to Holy BOS nicely concludes, this sanctuary will offer a playground for the creative minds….,Last Saturday, I had a tour of the church from the cellar to the church bell tower. Look at the photos and visit this incredible place soaked with history, sacred atmosphere and creativity soon!, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,….more photos on our ,.,It’s been subject to whispering and rumours for a couple of weeks now. This year’s , will bring much news. A, for better orientation; , and art spaces than ever; , (!); and Bushwick’s first very own ,., ,Last weekend, , music festival lit up the , in Fort Greene. The festival was a small-scale borough-centric event, featuring performances from musicians who’ve come to fame in New York.   The event was curated by ,, an epic rock band who hail from Cincinnati but have lived here in Brooklyn for some time. The festival- in its inaugural year- takes its name from the famous Walt Whitman poem which gushed: “I too lived—Brooklyn, of ample hills, was mine; I too walk’d the streets of Manhattan Island, and bathed in the waters around it.” There are a number of trendy curated festivals in the US and Europe, the most famous being ,- which boasts recent hosts like , and ,- but never have these festivals been based off of the overflowing talent of the land. Crossing Brooklyn Ferry, however, provided a rich sampling of music, cultivated from the diverse music scene of this sprawling, bordered landmass we call Brooklyn.,The 3-day festival, split between ,’s three in-building venues featured an incredible line-with several unique tiers of local festival performers. Headliners like , ,, ,and,whose music truly was born in NYC and Brooklyn, put a spotlight on local artists. This group of talent has made national waves with their innovative approach to the malleable genre that is Indie music- from new wave to experimental. Other artists, such as ,, and the , represent the transplant nature of many Brooklyn artists and residents. Though these bands didn’t begin in here in the city, they came to NYC to focus of music, find a solid fan base and have truly blossomed. A sweet layer Brooklyn buzzbands that have dominated the local music scene and are poised to blow up, like ,, ,, and ,, brightened the lineup for indie artists. Beyond this, a littering of diverse local talents, from the , to , finished off the festival in unique form.  The fest was rounded off by a few notably NOT-Brooklyn-based artists, like Georgia’s ,, filled out the rest of the line-up with an extra flourish of awesome.,I was lucky enough to attend the festival on Friday night, beyond excited to see the headliners and peek in on the film forum. In typical BAM fashion, the arts were well represented in the fest with 30 bands, songwriters, improvisers, composers, new music ensembles, and filmmakers taking part. In the tradition of the BAM, a classical streak influenced the music selections, and in the traditional of The National, an experimental approach dominated. This lead to an incredibly interesting sampling for Friday’s audience. I began the night in the Opera hall, observing the stylings of experimental rhythmic geniuses ,- who, though classically trained, have dabbled in indie/electronic genres, having collaborated with ,last year. They tend to favor strange sounds, and during this performance they used only metal tuning forks for an entire number. They are definite pioneers in their realm of music, and performed impressively.,Next I dropped in on ,, who, though featured on the small cinema stage, embodied much of CBF’s themes: classical influences, modern overtones, and a New York foundation. She played a haunting and beautiful violin melody while dueting with her computer, which hummed out minimal electronic sounds accompanied by undecipherable but beautiful computer-coated ,-like vocals., played next in the Opera House. A huge fan of (his previous band) ,, I was let down by his seemingly scattered and nonlinear performance. As a “math” rocker, he’s constantly balancing spaced beats in interesting ways. In this performance, his focus was there; it just didn’t connect with me. An interesting addition to the night, with a cool and interactive stage setup- it was dark, minimal and definitely weird-sounding. Let’s consider this the experimental base of the evening, although, not surprisingly, there were orchestral influences.,played shortly in the Opera House, and they blew the space away with their reverb-drenched, tenor-shimmering, “slowcore” rock songs. I can’t imagine their sound soaring as high anywhere else. It was as moving as a 45-minute set could be, and though their music is subtle, it’s intricate, and I could see why they’ve gained such infamy in New York- last year they even headlined a River Rocks free summer show., are an extremely talented band, an eclectic jangling of instruments and distorted yelpy vocals, playful in a way unlike so many of their contemporaries. Their name lends an idea to the funkiness that lies ahead in a listening experience- a buke is a six-string re-worked ukulele, and a gass (gase) is a guitar/bass hybrid. This band was actually , by the National, so it’s not surprising to see them as a headlining act. B&G pushes and pulls their instruments to almost unnatural limits, making them clank and squeal, which in turn informs lead singer’s “hiccupy” vocals, that are sometimes beautiful, but more often wacky, and unpredictably fitting.,Last and certainly the most incredible performance of the night came in the opera hall from ,. The dynamic front lady and electric-guitar goddess surprised me with her amount of manic energy and incredible stage presence. Tearing through most of her recently fantastic LP, ,, along with older, guitar-heavy songs and a (post) punk cover from the pop group, she lit up the stage for well over an hour and seriously captivated the crowd. Seriously, people were freaking out, including myself.,By the end of the night she had leaped into the small standing pit along the stage, and darted up the middle isle, rousing the seated-stunned audience to jump up for the rest of her set. I doubt that BAM’s generally very tame Opera house has ever seen as rock-hard a set; , is reinventing the woman’s place in rock music more than any other modern musician. She’s a wonderful performer, an intelligent songwriter, and she closed out Crossing Brooklyn Ferry in typical BK fashion- loud, sophisticated, and like nothing else.,The question is not whether , will be your favorite place. The question is whether you manage to find it or not!  Between the factories on Flushing Ave, this gentle, romantic white old farm house feels like a time travel to 17th century Netherlands. With a huge garden and historical interior it’s destined to be a center of culture and social gatherings. Its caretakers Adam and Chelsea have recently appeared in , and, in addition to the tours the house offers, have lately been active about involving Onderdonk Farm House in the lives Bushwick and Ridgewood community.,Two weeks ago, the House invited local vendors and buyers to spend a day of fresh air at a Flea Market. This past Friday, the House hosted Sculpture Garden curated by Bushwick artist and gallerist Deborah Brown and Lower East Side gallerist Leslie Heller.,The night was simply magical. The air smelled like grass (I repeat GRASS), some people came biking, and some walked with their kids and dogs. Being in the garden full of people and art felt like being at a summer festival. You had to pay more attention to discover art in grass than art in galleries, but it felt eternally better to look at sculptures on grass than on white walls!,The show included works of Sarah Bednarek, Reade Bryan, Joy Curtis, Adam Distenfeld, Ryan Michael Ford, Wendy Klemperer, Jolynn Krystosek, MaryKate Maher, Jim Osman, Brent Owens, Kirk Stoller, Kai Vierstra, and Natalia Zubko., , , , , , , , , , , , , ,My wife and I have been wishing we could afford a new mattress for a while now… like everyone else I know.  A new mattress can be a pretty big investment, and to drop that much money at once usually perpetuates people putting up with the mattress they have instead.  Thankfully, it’s tax return time!,We planned to shop around and hoped to find a deal for under $500, being our box spring is fine and we’ll only need the mattress.  We started at A&B Bedding because it is right around the block on Central Ave.  There was an open door with a gentleman standing in it, the owner, Rony.  The gates were down, but upon walking up to the door, it was obvious what they specialize in here- making mattresses.  Period.  No nonsense, no showroom, no salesmen, which I find to be a relief!  When a business operates with no extra frills or embellishments solely for appearance, you know “the proof is in the pudding!”  And you could shop elsewhere, and have to pay the salesmen, the manager, the owner, the rent, the franchise, and all whom they pay, but you just can’t beat direct manufacturer-to-customer transactions, especially face-to-face.,The space is a mattress factory, containing equipment, products in progress, and finished mattresses with small rows between the piles to scoot through.  We were looking for a firm bed, and he had some suitable options already built and in stock.  He also took us outside next door to show us the components they use and where they build.  He offered an array of options that can be custom-built on site with different styles, pillow-tops, and more.  They’ve been in business for 12 years, and have a great knowledge and commitment to satisfied customers.  Since Rony had what we wanted in stock and finished, he tied it onto my van, and we were on our way with a brand new, queen-sized Jennifer mattress for $300!  He gave me a plastic bag to dispose of the old mattress in, along with his card and assured me he would take care of any problems we could have to ensure our satisfaction.,*Update: my neighbor just got mattress AND boxspring for $390!  Booya!,We hit the second week of May, and we couldn’t be happier about how things are in Bushwick.  The weather is warm, but not excessively hot; the events are really exciting and people are so good. This week especially brings a lot of good events. Thunderdome at the Bushwick Church or Calypso at The Bushwick Starr, and more! Here is our weekly editorial selection of the coolest things going on in our pigeon town, and if you still don’t have enough, here are our ,., ,Once upon a time, there was a boy named ,, and Bobby had a church. Bobby liked to throw pretty crazy parties. So Bobby invited the entire Bushwick to experience a Thunderdome in his church. In addition to Thunderdome with bungees, Bobby will have music by ,  and , with special effects by ,. $10 in advance and $15 at the door will get you an unforgettable thunderdome experience, and possibly a deadly sin. Every good catholic girl must think: “At least it’s a protestant church!”,Bushwick’s beloved duo , are inviting ya all folks for their literary performance at ,. Calypso is a prose by Paul Rome with a soundrack by Roarke Menzie, and after everything we , and , in previous ultra-pleasant moments with this creative duo, we are very excited! Calypso seems to be the most awaited event of the Bushwick spring! So don’t think twice and get yourself an advance ticket for $10 or pay $15 at the door.,Call us suckers for warehouses, but we really like parties at secret location.  You have to take so many steps to locate it, that you really earn your party and don’t simply take it for granted. Rumble in Jungle is organized by Naked Roots and promises live bands on the roof, beer and even some kind of a free jungle juice if you come dressed up the jungle style. Additionally, there will be hoola hoops, face painting, barbeque and great visuals!,Bushwick has almost everything you can possibly dream of, but we lacked one serious thing! A Soapbox! Now we’ll have it on Sunday afternoon thanks to gallery , at 56 Bogart building. Anyone who wants to can vent, proclaim, proselytize, or just talk about something for up to three minutes is welcomed.,You probably heard it all before, but we have ,! And we couldn’t be more excited! Our beloved , is in charge, and he’s doing an incredible job. This creative DJ brings you super smooth hip hop you wish you knew before and could listen to all the time. Moreover, he invites pretty cool people as his guests. Frequent is his buddy MC RG who might throw in some freestyling just when you tune in. If you can’t make it in the times when we broadcast live, take a listen at least from ,., ,Wearing thick framed glasses and an informal suit, director Josef Astor leaned against the bar surrounded by a handful of keen students on Thursday night.  Josef Astor had come to Bushwick’s , to attend the screening of his documentary , and to discuss its broader meaning in the context of Bushwick as the present home to New York’s bohemia.,Lost Bohemia traces back the history of the artist Studios above Carnegie Hall that were demolished and replaced, for the most part, with corporate offices of CitiBank. The documentary focuses on the colorful portrayal of the last residents of the Studios and their unsuccessful battle against Carnegie Hall Corporation.,Unbeknownst to most New Yorkers, the historical building of Carnegie Hall was specifically designed and built in 1891 (by architect William Burnet Tuthill and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, respectively) with spaces for artistic work. These purpose-driven spaces had very high ceilings, skylights and large windows for natural light. The Studios served as live/work space for a number of visual and performing artists who left an invaluable imprint in the cultural landscape of this city and of the world. Isadora Duncan used to live there and rehearse new dance works; Enrico Caruso made his first recording there; Judy Garland used to sing on the roof every night. Marilyn Monroe, Grace Kelly and Robert Redford took acting lessons here and Lucille Ball had voice coaching. James Dean studied scripts and Leonard Bernstein, music.,The documentary begins in the 1980s when Josef Astor moved into studio #845 as a young photographer. What Astor didn’t know was that he wasn’t just getting one hell of an amazing studio, he was going to be adopted by a community of artists living there as a family.,Throughout the film, we meet several members of a beautiful community of artists, but mainly Josef’s neighbor, celebrity photographer Editta Sherman, also known as the Duchess of Carnegie Hall. We also meet Bill Cunningham, famous street fashion photographer for the New York Times; Donald Shirley, a classical pianist; Star, an 80-year old ballerina who secretly does her stretches in the hallway…,The atmosphere of the serene creative refuge starts to change in the second part of the film. We learn of the eviction notices sent to some tenants, while others are given several months to leave. Almost like a , villain, Carnegie Hall Corporation forces the artists out, one after another. The artists fight back, they protest, they go to the court, they try to draw the media attention, but are ultimately forced to leave. Feminist poet Elizabeth Sargent is the last standing tenant, and she talks to us throughout the documentary as a mysterious voice through a series of answering machine recordings.,As the film progresses, we are served images of what is built in the vacated premises – conference rooms, cubicles, fax machines.,According to unofficial information, over 80% of the Studios will serve as corporate offices for Citi Group. The “very needed” music school will comprise of less than 20% of the premises.,Among other interesting facts that the audience learns during the Q&A is that the Carnegie Hall building has a landmark status and that the building belongs to the City that leased it to Carnegie Hall Corporation., , ,While the story of demolished artist studios is heartbreaking, it has another more useful dimension.  It is a story of corporate machinery getting away with anything it wants while the urban policy creators and media silently nod along.,I believe that the contemporary Bushwick can either take a lesson from history or learn from its own mistakes. There is an ongoing discussion among the members of the art scene in Bushwick, formally started by ,, about what can be done in order to preserve this artist paradise without anyone being pushed out in the upcoming years. (Anyone includes long-term residents, as well as the artists).,While our discussions regularly include an artist tortured by self-loathing taking a stand and admitting the responsibility for gentrification, the realtors chuckle…,The artists are , responsible for gentrification. But before you silently start to cry in your studio, let’s see what a sociologist Sharon Zukin says in her “gentrification bible” ,Zukin describes ,. The property owners are looking to increase the value of the property in the neighborhood converting industrial buildings into artists lofts, and by recruiting artists to live and work there. The artist life style creates “hip” ambience which attracts small businesses – galleries, bars, restaurants. This new “hip” infrastructure attracts different classes of people from the city who are looking to buy a property for an increased value or who are ready to pay much higher rent.,I will conclude with a quote of Sharon Zukin from the series of interviews for the website , where she explained the necessary steps in order to create a sustainable environment for both long-term residents, as well as artists to live without a fear of being priced out.,[box]“The first step is to be aware of the cultural power that people have. The second step is to force local governments to make policies and to make laws to protect people’s right to stay in the apartments or houses that they have. And this is true for the people whose mortgages are being foreclosed as it is of tenants whose apartment complexes have been bought by big investment company. There have to be actions by the state, zoning, laws… and encouragements for long-time residents. Don’t forget that the people who have been in the city for a couple of years are on the way of becoming the long-term residents….”[/box], ,Maggie and Brian Muldoons are cousins from Bushwick who have slightly different plans for the summer than the rest of us… While we will most likely be eating tacos at Rockaway Beach or playing frisbee on Coney Island, these two will be teaching art and tutoring girls in the poorest part of Africa.,West Point in Liberia is a place with a sad recent history. The country was stuck  in a brutal civil war conflict for 14 years. As it usually happens, the ones who suffer the most are usually the most innocent – the children. Many of these local girls orphaned at early age and have fallen victim to child prostitution.,According to the Muldoons current UNESCO statistics report that an estimated 73%, of primary-aged children are out of school in post-conflict Liberia. Getting these girls the education they need will make a major difference in their lives. It is reported that girls in the developing world who receive seven or more years of education, marry four years later and have 2.2 fewer children.,Muldoons want to work as volunteer artists with a non-profit organization More Than Me, and want to help supplement the girls’ education with activities the school doesn’t offer. They want to teach art and undertake other artistic endeavors, which will strengthen problem-solving and critical-thinking skills, and will add to overall academic achievement and school success.,Muldoons have started a campaign to raise $7,000 for the trip. Opting for a,, they have nearly reached their goal.,To help Muldoons realize their dream to help Liberian girls, Bushwick cafe , is throwing them a benefit this Saturday at 9pm. Five Bushwick bands (Deathrow Tull, Brian and Mick of The Nuclears, Photon Dynamo and the Shiny Pieces, Cave Days, ADVAITA) have volunteered to play, and there will be free chips and salsa from the Brooklyn Salsa Co, sweets and hand made t-shirts for sale; a raffle and auction for great Bushwick stuff such as a $65 dollar bar tab at The Pine Box Rock Shop, Little Skips gift cards, custom paintings from Bushwick artists, a free haircut from Bushwick Salon owner Chelsey Pickthorn, headshots/photoshoots from Bushwick photographers Sarah Tamar and Ky Digregorio, and a whole bunch more!,100% of the proceeds will go to help the Muldoons to build a safe house for young girls in Liberia who are at risk for violence and sexual exploitation.,Guys, this is definitely a cause worth supporting not to mention all the goodies that the Muldoons have prepared in collaboration with all the Bushwick businesses. Stop by on Saturday at Little Skips and help these wonderful folks to improve life to a couple of children who were not as lucky as us…,If you happened to be awake and online at noon on Saturday, you probably heard some the soft launch of the 1st live Bushwick Daily Radio show.,RG and Nipsy from , were hangin’ at ,‘s studio for a Saturday afternoon broadcast, spinning some music, chatting a bit, and freestyling! We had listeners checking in around the country, in bars, restaurants, and in the car!,If you missed it don’t be sad, because here it is!

The film screening is followed by the Q&A with the director Josef Astor.,A cult Bushwick band , has previously presented an apocalyptical musical play at , titled ,. The play was a huge success! Currently, Passkontrol is preparing a short film of the same name. On Friday and Saturday, the band will read the screenplay to the film at The Bushwick Starr.

Because we plan on chilling at the outdoor opening of a sculpture exhibition at the ,. Sculpture Garden will really something to look for. Curated by the famous ladies Deborah Brown and Leslie Heller, the line up of artists is very interesting, and promises of the loveliest art events of the year! Oddly enough, we are still meeting quite a lot of people who haven’t been to the Onderdonk Farm House.

But it’s true!,The Lowbrow Society in conjunction with ,, an awesome chill gallery at a Bushwick loft is bringing you an art show on the verge of ehm… porn.

Opened in October 2011, AIRPLANE belongs to the legacy of new awesome artist-run Bushwick galleries.  This is their first solo show!,At 7:45 am I loaded up my cart with 200 copies of the first issue of the Brooklyn Occupant, 20 umbrellas, a dozen foam core signs with prints from ,, and headed out to , May Day Morning Commute. As I looked at the pile of supplies I gathered, I had a twinge of doubt as to whether there would be enough people at Maria Hernandez to distribute them to. The facebook event had climbed from 162 to 188 confirmed attendees during the night, but being a musician who uses facebook to invite people to gigs, I’d become understandably cynical as to the accuracy of RSVP counts in the digital world.,As I walked up the southwest pathway of the park towards the center circle, I could only see about a dozen people standing around in umbrellas and panchos and my heart started to sink a little bit. I knew that the numbers would climb a bit before we commenced our march, but the image in my head of only 15 people chanting and holding banners wasn’t going to be very inspiring or impressive. I shook off these pessimistic thoughts as I walked up to the circle and gave a big hollar and shouted “Happy May Day!” I figured if we’re going to be small, might as well be spirited.,Naturally, there was a disproportionate police presence standing around, but that’s pretty much the status quo for all occupy events. Moments after I started pulling out supplies from my cart, a community relations officer walked up beside me and asked “Who’s in charge here?”, which prompts me to laugh a little bit before I say “Everyone, but I can talk to you about the event if you have any questions.” The officer was very polite with me and after I told her what our route for the march was, she said “I know why you’re marching and I just wanna make sure you guys are safe,” and gave me a look that undeniably signaled her suppressed support for the cause.,As 9am approached and people continued to stream in at a steady pace. Even more encouraging was the amount of press that had showed up to cover the event. There was one reporter from ,, another covering the story for WNYC, and more that I didn’t even notice until well into the march. By the time we were ready to embark, over fifty people had amassed and all of my fears of a “mini-march” dissolved completely.,We marched from Knickerbocker to Flushing to Broadway, escorted by at least a dozen police vehicles on the street and bookended by officers. The goal of this event wasn’t to “block the streets” or “shutdown Bushwick”, but if it had been, we couldn’t have had a better ally than the NYPD. Their escort caravan pretty much stopped the traffic on Broadway from Flushing all the way to the Williamsburg Bridge. At first, this sort of disruption made some marchers (myself included) nervous about turning off morning commuters stuck in the traffic, but that fear turned out to be unfounded as car after car honked and threw out calls and waves of support. One of the organizers of the march, Kyle, didn’t miss a single opportunity to run up to each friendly driver and give them some literature on May Day.,As I walked, a reporter with CapitalNewYork.com , about the march and OWS in general. I told him that for me, OWS has become a civic obligation. Either I try to make this movement work, or sit back and watch the status quo destroy itself. The Democratic party’s behavior since the 2012 election has forced me to acknowledge the fact that the bi-partisan consensus has left me behind. If I want to see end the wars on drugs and terror, a stop to corporate hegemony over political discourse, or a full and open accounting of the crimes of Wall St and high-level government officials, there simply is no place for me in the two party system.,Once we arrived at Continental Plaza at 10am, members of Occupy Williamsburg were waiting to join us. A big cheer went around the park as we arrived everyone gathered around the statue of George Washington. Almost immediately, a member of the National Lawyers Guild mic-checked the crowd to inform all of us of our rights, how to deal with being arrested, and asked everyone to write their phone number on their arm.,The march over the bridge was pushed back a half hour to 11am, to allow for more people to join us. As we waited, everyone got to know everyone, more reporters from the local ABC and NBC affiliates conducted interviews, and a large group decided to march around the plaza until it was time to leave in the hope of bringing along some of the nearby locals. When it was finally time to head out, we had gathered somewhere between 200 and 300 people. The police announced to the crowd that we were to keep moving, not to go onto roadway (which isn’t even really possible to do on the bridge), and not to drop any banners. With that we set out onto the bridge, along with the mini-marching band of drums and even a tuba that had at some point joined up with us, and aside from three arrests of occupiers who masked up and were carrying shields, everything went perfectly smoothly.,All of us in the movement have different priorities and embrace different tactics, but we are united in our understanding of the fact that our government has rendered the average citizen’s opinion to be irrelevant. The 1% (or more accurately the 0.1%) have attained full-spectrum dominance of our political discourse through their control of major traditional media outlets and campaign contributions. We are working to subvert that dominance by reminding people of the power we have when we come together to say “ENOUGH”.,Some still lament the fact that OWS doesn’t have a one or two “demands”, but this is an extremely uninformed criticism. Every single person in this movement has a set of demands, which they’d all be more than happy to share with you (whether you ask them to or not), and it’s not hard at all to find several that nearly all of us share:,That’s just a handful of policy proposals that I suspect every single Occupier would love to see enacted, or at least wouldn’t be opposed to. Not one of those issues is a part of the Democratic or Republican party platforms, nor will they ever be without heavy and sustained pressure from the people. Yesterday was exactly what needed to happen, and it needs to happen again and again and again until we get the Change, we were sold on in 2008., have , in the past, and are back at it again with their recent EP release party at Public Assembly. One half of the electronic duo hails from Bushwick and they’ve made waves throughout the borough for their intelligent sound, strong fan base, and always fun live shows. They are a local band that strikes the perfect balance in a sound as catchy as it is complex.,Last week they performed in a typically stellar , showcase with other New Yorkers , and Bushwick-ees ,. But Tiny Victories, known endearingly as Tiny Vix, stole the show, playing a loud, intricate, and interactive set that included many opportunities for fans and friends in the audience to collaborate with Tiny Victories’ Greg and Cason, who passed the mic around for random vocal samples. The duo then built elaborate compositions overtop these (sometimes hilarious) sound scraps, transforming them into beats for their various songs. Their sound is so dramatic and so lyrically personal it’s hard to see it translating into such a fun experience, but these guys have the best stage presence ever. The crowd almost lost it jumping hysterically to the arena-poppy yet terrific beats and best-night-of-your-life arena chanting in “Get Lost.”,Let’s not forget this isn’t Tiny Vix’s first time around the block, although , is their first official LP. They were picked on NPR as a , and their single, “Lost Weekend” was even ,.  Lost Weekend is laden with buzzing baselines, shimmering synths, helicopter-wing beats, and a matter-of-fact rhythmic choral line that gives you no chance but to get sucked into the song. Download it below., ,What makes Tiny Victories so special? Is it the gentle calm somehow found among layer upon layer of white noise, electronic scribbles, and echoing vid-kid beats? Is it Greg’s incredible voice (better than ever live) droning beautifully like an opera-quality, angelic-y Interpol? Or is it the intense smatterings of percussion?  You’ll just have to go figure out for yourself. Download “Lost Weekend” below, listen to the rest of their album on ,, and go see them May 3,at Glasslands people!, [right-click!], , ,After nearly four months of meeting at the Shops at the Loom due to the cold, , is finally moving out into the open. The general assembly has always been open to everyone, but it hasn’t been very visible beyond the patrons of the Loom. That all changes on May 1st, with our first major event: ,.,A couple weeks ago, some local General Assembly attendees got together with members of Occupy Williamsburg to come up with an event for our groups to hold in solidarity with the Nationwide , (or Day without the 99%). Here’s what we’ve worked out for #M1GS:,
Free Coffee + Breakfast!,
Connect! Make allies for the day!,
Connect with Occupy Williamsburg!,I had planned to write a long, well-researched article on why everyone should participate in the strike and to develop a comprehensive list of all the ways that you can participate. Bad news is that I was spread a little too thin this month with a million other obligations to get it done. The good news is that plenty of other, , than I have , ,. If you’re participating tomorrow, be sure to read this ,.,Check back here tomorrow for live updates or follow @,, and be sure to keep an eye on , and , to watch history unfold in real time! Whatever you do, don’t buy anything unless it’s absolutely essential, and if you’ve never been to an Occupy event, today is a great day to finally meet the movement first hand.,Paul Rome and Roarke Menzies showed up at brunch with a box with air holes. Inside it were two kittens.,
“These are for you.” Paul said.,
This is a good way to bribe a writer into plugging your next project. I pulled some salvia and a valium out of a tin box and put the salvia under my tongue. Then I listened to them tell me about their new literary performance: Calypso. I put the valium on a napkin.,
I turned my focus to the kittens. Thirty minutes later a waitress refilled my coffee. I turned on a recording device and asked about things that they have enjoyed working on.,It was almost exactly a year ago when we informed you that ,, a cool new music venue, restaurant and a bar was opening on Bogart Street in Bushwick. Today Bushwick twitters were buzzing about The Morgan being shut down…., ,Last year we rushed to , The Morgan’s a co-owner Richard Guishard about this promising new venue. Richard told us a lot good stuff and created a lot of expectations among the Bushwick folk:,[box]Bushwick Daily: ,The Morgan: Yes, definitely, we will have concerts… We want to target Bushwick and Williamsburg people, maybe also people from Manhattan. Depending on the type of the event and on the promoter.,Bushwick Daily: ,The Morgan: I don’t have a particular music inclination, but I want this place to be a reflection of the neighborhood. I want people to contribute. I want local bands, but also performances, lectures… I want this to be a community center. I see you have art hanging on the walls… Yes, we will be having rotating exhibitions.[/box],Soon after , [RIP] brought a less than stellar review of the place titling it ,.,Anyway, long story short: The Morgan experienced several drastic changes through its history. To name a few, let’s remember the surprising tranformation of the menu from a sort of a burger place to a Thai restaurant; or the change in vibe from an indie music venue to a kind of Manhattan company party venue. The force behind these changes was, according to Richard Guishard, the management he hired for the place to make the venue financially sustainable. Today we spoke with Richard on the phone about the reasons for closing The Morgan. “People felt alienated there. I was receiving too many complaints about the people who ran the place,” he said. We have to agree. The Morgan wasn’t really on the radar of too many Bushwick locals on a Friday night. Richard also told us that he plans to re-open the place in a couple of months but with the vision he originally had. He wants the place to be ran by local people from the neighborhood as opposed to the Bronx crowd. We couldn’t agree more with the decision! In words of Bushwick Nation…., ,After getting off the Morgan stop a few weekends ago, art lovers were greeted by a giant ,, lounging on a sidewalk. Inside 56 Bogart, a lady was rolling around in ,, and “living sculptures” were posing in crazy outfits at the end of the hall. Partly due to the recent , as “a raw-edged art hub,” a certain level of edginess is expected to be seen in there. Some expect to be blown away by crazy avant-garde art or weird imagery, with which Bushwick artists rebel against the confines of gallery expectations and collectors in Chelsea. But sometimes you just see some damn good work, even if it may lean on more traditional concepts.,An example of this can be seen tonight at ,, where Bushwick-based artist , will be showing her recent works. There will be no robots or sleeping bags (I mean, you never know), but Michel’s work is a breath of fresh air within the scene. Her pieces deal with one of the most beautiful and classic forms of all time - the human figure. The paintings, often headless are vivid and full of stretching, twisting, and swaying muscles. Michel cites an obsession with the human body and Gray’s Anatomy that began when she was just four, so it is no wonder the viewer can feel a great connection to the figures in the work. Each torso seems to gently twist and pull away from the canvas, born from an ethereal mix of colors in the background and submerged in some kind of cosmic space. It’s almost as if Michel hasn’t created these figures as much as she has uncovered them. “They [the figures] are already there,” she explained, “I just expose them.”, ,What makes these figures different than, say, your favorite Michelangelo sketch of anatomy is their ability to feel organic. In my opinion, this is due to Michel’s painting technique.  Michel paints each body with her body, using only her hands as tools. “I’m physical, the body is physical and it’s all energy so why interrupt that with a brush?”,“I felt freer this time around,” said Michel of showing in Bushwick. “[Little Skips] is very different and that’s why I chose it. I’m already annoyed with the gallery air, it’s all that ‘bourgie art scene thing’ I was looking to get away from. And Linda [co-owner of Little Skips], well she’s the best energy so what could be better?” Between the energy of Michel’s paintings, and the energy found within Little Skips (we’re not just talking caffeine energy) the show will refresh any viewer. Bring your body to see some bodies tonight at Little Skips!,It’s 10:00am on the opening day of the show.,: “There’s something I had to do today…”, ,: “Throw a massive party?”,Rooms are never prepped. Artists forget installation day. Bands cancel hours before the opening. Your printer runs out of ink. FedEx delivers artwork but you’re not home to sign for it because you’re getting bagels with your friends around the corner, so it gets sent back to the office in Maspeth. You don’t know how to get to Maspeth because you don’t have a car. Your co-curator saves the potentially-empty gallery wall space by driving you to Maspeth 4 hours before the opening. And this is just a fraction of the obstacles that the independent curator has to hurdle over in order to put a few dozen pieces of artwork on some walls., , , ,[quote]Somehow, you make people tell you throughout the night that you should do this more often, while you think ‘THIS IS THE LAST TIME…’ but you know it won’t be.[/quote],This past Saturday, , opened at Brooklyn Fire Proof. The visual curator was yours truly, and the bands were booked and sound handled by my friend and audio engineer Jon Perrelly (together, we make up ,.),Curating group shows in a venue that you don’t own is kind of like herding a field of cattle that may or may not have Mad Cow disease with someone else’s sheep dog that speaks another language.  Okay, it’s not always that unpredictable, but it has the potential to be. You have six artists in the show and six walls divided by columns. What do you do if one of them leaves the country and forgets to give you their work? While a show is up for a week, some work gets stolen or damaged and the venue has no security cameras – what do you tell the artist? You may say “installation will occur between 7-9pm” and end up dropping the hammer at 2am on a Friday night. You may hold on to work for 6 months after the show ends. There are a million things that can go wrong with the execution of a show, but at the end of it all, a considerable amount of people got a chance to look at work that they most likely wouldn’t have seen had you not spent all that time and caused all those self-inflicted headaches. You also most likely will get a chance to speak to other dedicated artists and curators and set up a studio visit in your euphoric and tipsy state during the opening. Not to mention it helps to have a bunch of supportive, creative, and skillful friends to put tacks in the wall, collect money at the door, fold your press booklets, snake audio cables through the walls, laugh at you for being so neurotic about measurements, and to get the crowd going insane during the bands performance.,If you are a dedicated curator, you make the show work. You make the artists happy to have their work hanging in a place other than their bedroom wall. Somehow, you make people tell you throughout the night that you should do this more often, while you think ‘THIS IS THE LAST TIME…’ but you know it won’t be.,All in all, if you love art and community enough to curate a show, go for it. Mad Cow Disease has fallen 90% since 2005, and some artists appreciate your efforts enough to thank you endlessly, or at least to buy you a beer.,Below are some photos from the opening night.,The State of the Loft Law panel discussion was led by Assemblyman Vito Lopez on Tuesday. He was joined by the NYC Department of Buildings, the NYC Loft Board, and Councilmembers Stephen Levin and Erik Martin Dilan.,Learn more about the law and how to , on the ,.,Video credits:,Produced and edited by Mariya Pylayev,Music by Moldy Beans","

". That’s the premise , derived, not from mathematical computations, but from his geometrical paintings. Rob de Oude was born and raised in the Netherlands, but art school exchange in New York spurred a set of coincidences and he eventually settled in Bushwick, where he now lives with his wife and 4-year old twins. Rob works in Ridgewood, in 17-17 Troutman building, which is also a new home to the gallery he co-runs, ,., ,Just a perfect mix. That’s what comes to our mind when looking at this , for the neighborhood of Bushwick. We have everything from fulfilling your Bushwick citizen duty to flea market shopping at the least likely places. Before we proceed to looking at 5 we like the best, let’s look at the new video by Portland band , ,.,Bushwick and Ridgewood galleries have always been surrounded by a haze of a mystery. Galleries in apartments, galleries in garages, pop up shows popping right in front of your eyes on the most unlikely places….  As the gallery community is growing everyday, it is harder and harder to keep track of all the art happenings in the neighborhood without a little help. To shed a little bit of light into the Bushwick gallery mystery, we created a whole new page on Bushwick Daily titled “,” dedicated solely to the programming of the galleries in the area. Galleries page contains a map and a calendar – two tools that can prove to be invaluable when exploring the Bushwick art scene. Both the map and the calendar have been created following the initiative of the gallery owners who themselves wanted to know who is open on the weekend or who has an opening on Friday night.,The map contains the location of , in Bushwick/Ridgewood area. The map is downloadable and in addition contains the contacts to the gallery owners and a link to their websites. If you have a gallery in the area that is not listed on the map, please ,, and we will add you on the map.,The calendar is contains all the art events in the neighborhood. It is curated directly by the galleries who have access to , where they can add art openings, events or simply times during which they are open. You don’t have to be a gallery if you want to enter your art event. Simply add it to the calendar and it will appear on Bushwick Daily shortly. If you have any issues with the calendar, shoot us , and we will help you.,We at Bushwick Daily are pretty happy to see all the information at one place, and are very happy to be able to help the gallerist community as well as curious art explorers. For the future, we are planning to develop more tools, both for the online as well as offline world., ,Enjoy!, , ,You can tell you’re in Ridgewood by the chill atmosphere that lingers in the local galleries and bars. Sort of on the periphery of Bushwick, Ridgewood is enjoying its off-radarness. On Friday night, our favorite Ridgewood gallery , opened their new show, ,, in a post-trippy festive fashion.,Matthew Mahler, who curated the show, built it around the hypothesis that everything - from fashion trends to socio-political statements made public on Twitter – echoes sentiments of the countercultural revolution of the ’60s and ’70s and is littered with reminders of the psychedelic. Ten artists in the show (Andrea Bergart, Thomas Burke, Lisa Candage, Myla Dal Besio, Rob de Oude, Adrian Jevicki, Matthew Mahler, Jenna Ransom, Adam Parker Smith and Aaron Williams) have been subconsciously incorporating the trippy reminders that have now became a part of pop culture. Seriously. How would art look nowadays if nobody had tried LSD and told us what the world looked like?, ,The art show proved the excellent taste of Small Black Door. The desire for more color, more variety and more innovation in arts has been apparent throughout the programming of Small Black Door., ,The opening was friendly, half BYOB/half Coors supplied. We merrily discussed the Ridgewoodian happenings. Matt Mahler, a co-owner of the gallery told us that Jonathan Terranova, his buddy and the other co-owner has just become father and, thus, very understandably missed the opening. Rob de Oude, an artist in the show and a co-owner of new Parallel Art Space, was mentioning the upcoming art walk in Ridgewood organized by the Queens Museum. It’s called “This is Ridgewood actually” and likely refers to the fact that parts of Ridgewood were called Bushwick in previous years. We all concluded that the neighborhood borders discussion is a waste of energy, and the beautiful creative spirit is common to both Bushwick and Ridgewood. Moreover, it doesn’t come from the specific geographic location but from the people who live in both Bushwick and Ridgewood…, ,Colorful lights on the walls have inspired many people stop since the afternoon. Diego was about to get a haircut at a neighboring barber shop when he spotted the lights of six different colors. He had to come in and look at the artwork of , at , gallery. Moreover, he promised to come back with his little daughter. Last Friday at the dawn, I felt like Diego – absolutely mesmerized by the colorful light at the walls of a tiny gallery at 16 Wilson., ,Carol Salmanson has a studio at the newly famous building at 56 Bogart. In her work she likes to experiment with lights and other reflective materials. Salmanson creates dreamy, almost magical worlds by taming electricity and light. Her works at Storefront Bushwick  were created using LED lights. Carol told us that the lights come in six different colors, many of which have been discontinued. Carol buys them online in large quantities. She was trained as a painter, and the illuminated pieces all started as gestural drawings. These were subsequently recreated as illuminated maps of the drawings.  Storefront also exhibits a set of her paintings and some of her charcoal drawing. We can see where all the abstraction comes from based on the more traditional media.,In the project room, ,is exhibiting his , series. These geometric abstract paintings speak to the viewer through the unlikely mix of honesty and vagueness, closeness and distance. Stephen is a master of color combination and color blending who creates fresh, attractive, almost addictive spaces.  The paintings are made in gouache and pencil on stretched and prepared paper.,BushwickDaily.com presents “,‘s Mixtape- Sounds of Reggae: Past and Present”,Happy 420 folks!,These selections range from roots-reggae to dancehall to hip-hop, with a quick track from the 1940′s at the beginning.  The upbeat-rocking fundamental to reggae music is a well-suited template for meditation and medication, sometimes driving, sometimes laid-back.  The use of effects and fills in reggae is also very unique to the genre, as many tracks have “entrances” to cut-in when being DJed.  Jamaica’s music is the seed for the bloom of hip-hop and many other genres.  The concept of DJing popular today originated in Jamaica with the use of soundsystems and soundclashes between competing DJ’s.  One DJ would set-up at the end of a block and boom, and another would compete down the block for the crowd to come dance at his end.  Jamaican immigrants like DJ Kool Herc purveyed these customs upon arriving in NYC and birthed an entirely new way of playing, listening, and performing, leading to new styles of dance, art, and more.  A tremendously important style to music’s ongoing growth, and a key history of significant influences.,Buck Washington- Save the Roach for Me,Triston Palma- Joker Smoker,Lee “Scratch” Perry- Soul Fire,The Techniques- You Don’t Care,Pinchers- I’m a Don,Suger Chick- Roach Killer,Althea & Donna- Uptown Top Ranking,Lady G- Legal Rights,Dennis Brown- Fire from the Observer Station,10 Ft.

They were a living time capsule of sorts, discarded evidence of life as someone once knew it in the ’40s and ’50s. Perhaps taking a cue from this, , takes a similar 3D snapshot of life at this time at his current show at ,. It’s easy to look back and reflect, and think ahead and dream, but capturing the moment, the feeling of nowness, is no easy feat.,Upon entering English Kills gallery, the viewer feels like a fly swirling around the junk yard of life (an actual fly was spotted upon arrival). Pop-out pieces are scattered around the gallery, hung on walls, broken glass, dirty metal and twisted wires where paintings and drawings usually hang - dark, dirty, and seemingly morose.,Cutouts of magazines and images of snakes and other seemingly discarded memories appear to be part of a sculptural scrapbook. The pieces evoke both a cheerful and somber tone. Some works seem to joyful contain images of weddings and happy moments, like in the piece titled , in which an actual magazine with this image is also filled with scraps and metal. Others seem haunting, a reminder of what our discarded things may say about us. A work titled ,, for example, appears to be a small broken old school tv, one that you might take with you to your college dorm or a campsite. A thick, spiral cord sprawls out the back, as if ripped from whatever socket once gave it life. The image on the screen is a faint whisper of a man’s face, the eyes and nose just barely visible as they peek through a foggy faded screen. After seeing the look in his eyes, one wonders if this box is the host to his life, perhaps the cord feeds him life, acting as a sort of spine or brain stem., ,It is hard not to look at Hurst’s works and make the connection to Rauschenberg, but in the context of today, it takes on a totally original meaning. It’s interesting to think of the idea of being “plugged into” a TV in the ’50s, and what it means to have a brain stem connected to media today. An image of a magazine or a pay phone has different meaning in today’s world of ephemeral media, of the disregard for physical objects as services and material moves onto the web., ,To behold the physical scrapbook style of Hurst’s pieces in the show is a refreshing experience. To look at an object and the way he juxtaposes materials of different subject matter gives objects normally deemed as shallow (phones, TVs, magazines) a whole new way of communicating with his audience. A favorite piece in the show is one you can’t see, but is perhaps the most important. A part of the show that makes each piece pop, makes each piece attention grabbing, makes each piece important: 2012, the current time and place and all that it encompasses., , , , ,I don’t know how about you and your acid experience, but one time on that mountain cottage, a guy with a small, innocent looking paper appeared, and xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx., ,Crazy story, right!?,Anyway. We are stealing the acid theme and the acid song from , gallery which is having a Post Acid opening. Here are the best events in our beloved hallucinogenic township of Bushwick.,We have been praising , ,. The fact is that we absolutely love this Internet radio station broadcasting from Bushwick. And yes, we can’s stop listening to it all the time. So hold it against us if you want, but since these guys , their brand new awesome website, listening to the fresh new sounds from Brooklyn and beyond has never been better! To celebrate their re-birth, Newtown Radio is throwing a huge party at Shea Stadium! You can imagine that these guys would have the best bands in town playing, and it is absolutely true. Dirty Beaches, Windowspeak, Black Marble, Family Portrait, Cousins and MORE will play on Saturday night! The whole parade will cost you $15 (or $12 in advance).,Indian soap opera about the art world based in Bushwick? Sure! Meenakshi Thirukode, in collaboration with ,, is gearing for the filming of a crazy meta-narrated story that has never been told! We , who told us all the spicy details about Bollywood and more. We believe this project is really worth your attention, folks. On Saturday night, the crew will kickstart their , campaign in a glamorous Bollywood style. They will have hindi music, make up artist, vintage clothing and jewlery – all in Indian style. Additionally, the exhibition of art created for the film by Stefano Ortega and Federico Massa will open at the same night. All your donations will go to support the kickstarter campain.,Bear Skin is the name of the art show featuring tattoo artists: Rachel Hauer, Spencer Alexander, Adam Paterson, Jeremy Aquilino, Timmy Martineau and Bishop203. We simply love the idea of putting together an art show featuring tattoo artists! With tattoos and tough kids comes punk music, so the art show will feature also concerts of Big Shots Jett Brando, Wyldlife, Ritz Riot. $4 will get you in and includes free wine until 9pm!,We’re listing ANOTHER awesome event for Saturday night. Yep, it might be a lot to handle but you gotta do what you gotta do, and rest when you’re retired or move to Williamsburg (*joke ya, Willy people*). , is a cute Brooklyn-made accessory shop  and an art gallery on Standhope St. They have been closed for couple of months now, and we’ve missed them. So go feel like a sardine at Sardine (it’s a tiny space), and check out great art by local talent (Monica Cook, Rob de Oude, Sam Martineau, Gary Murphy, Alexandra Rubinstein, Robin Scheines, Adam Taye, Andrew Zarou).,On Friday night, head over to Ridgewood, and look for ,, because you will find some post acid art behind them. Following their epic mention in the ,, we are expecting the gallery to be awesome. As usual ,   (Andrea Bergart, Thomas Burke, Lisa Candage, Myla Dal Besio, Rob de Oude, Adrian Jevicki, Matthew Mahler, Jenna Ransom, Adam Parker Smith and Aaron Williams)., ,Surrounded by the necessary dose of mystery, drama, flashy accessories, colorful outfits, and naturally hundreds of ,, ,is probably the least likely art project in Bushwick these days,Meenakshi Thirukode teamed up with , with the idea to film a true Bolllywood soap opera. Yes, right here in Bushwick.,“Bushwick is the perfect place,” says Meenakshi. The soap opera takes place in the art world, and follows the story of a young South Asian woman who came to America to make it big. She gets a degree, an internship in a gallery, falls in love, and moves to Bushwick. In addition to all the obstacles that the art world itself brings, she has to deal with being an immigrant and a woman in a mainly man-dominated world. Naturally, her family would like to see her in a more traditional role, which isn’t exactly where her life is going…, will use all the components of a Bollywood soap opera to tell the story: songs, dancing, and meta narratives with characters stepping in and out of their roles. Audience will play a big role as it will often be a part of the filming. The film set and the simultaneous screening will be located in the gallery space of The Bogart Salon.,For a glimpse of the Bollywood glamour, come to , Meenakshi and the crew is organizing this Saturday at The Bogart Salon. ,crew promises Hindu dancing and a lot of fun. Additionally, the audience gets to play a small part of the script for the camera, which will be used in the soap opera. They will have a bindi make up artists present and a lot of Indian jewelry and vintage clothing designed by Terese Bennette and Matthew.  Simultaneosly, an art exhibition of art created for the film by Federico Massa and Stefano Ortega will open.,You can probably easily imagine that we talked with Meenakshi Thirukode for hours about the project. She told us all about Bollywood, its obsession with light skin, melodrama, MIA’s music and why is the project important…,[quote] I’m also interested in addressing the broader perceptions within and outside the art world – like the idea of an “immigrant” or being a “woman of color” or being “brown.” I moved to the US when I was 23 and until that point I was never categorized under any of those terminologies. The burden of those signifiers is kind of thrown at you merely because it’s just easy…[/quote], ,Yes, my background is more specifically in the history of the art market, connoisseurship and art criticism. I took up the Masters program at Christie’s auction house.  I wanted to understand the nature of the beast, so to speak. At the time, India, along with China was considered the big emerging market. (You might notice how we are forever considered an emerging market.) It was all about the market. I’m glad that every single day during my masters program alongside theory, we were thrust into the “real” world too. And the real world not that pretty at all. In my curatorial work, my articles and essays, I have tried to understand everything – all those contradictions, expectations, perceptions, including specifically the very narrow lens through which South Asian art and artists are being contextualized or seen.,I’m interested in perception and how it lends to our understanding of what we think is real, what is the truth.  Also what role might the expectations – from yourself as well as from others including your peers, play. I think we work in an industry where the lines between personal and professional are so blurred that its hard to separate the two and those relationships, those networks for better or worse dictate how well you do or how your work is received or put out there or talked about…,This project is another dimension through which I’m exploring all that. There are so many stories there that are essential, that need to be told from how I experienced it  – as a woman, as an immigrant…,The idea really stemmed from conversations with Peter Hopkins. I found a real connection with him! We felt that telling this art world story through the narrative style of soap operas was perfect because it touchs all the emotional arcs of what life really is. And we wanted to push it some more…push it so you think you are watching this young South Asian woman struggle in a treacherous industry that is the art world…It’s that and it’s also more…The narratives break, meta narratives start to pop up, slippages occur…The characters you see aren’t just scripted but some of them are being played out in “real” life.  I exist in many realities in this project – online and in the physical world. Which one of those is the real story or the real person is for you to decide! Maybe all of them are real…Maybe the main narrative is based on real life experience or maybe not…Maybe Meenakshi is real and Em Tee isn’t…Maybe Em Tee is real and Meenakshi stopped existing somewhere along the line….Who knows!,One thing is certain.  This never ending thirst and consumption of images and everything being produced here is just taking these narratives and images that are out there in contemporary popular culture and regurgitating them – because that’s what the world wants and expects, and will take. So I’m giving it to them.,[quote]We felt that telling this art world story through the narrative style of soap operas was perfect because it touches all the emotional arcs of what life really is.[/quote], ,Bollywood hates being called Bollywood! Because they find that a “westernized” term derived from Hollywood. Semantic Wars! Anyways, I have to say that while it’s a Bollywood reference, most of the Western world equates to movies from India. However, there are close to 24 regional film industries.  Each state in India has its own language and its own cultural specificities – from rituals of birth, weddings, food to traditional clothing. Naturally, the films, the music, it all varies too. I’m using music and the script of a language from the part of India that I grew up in, Tamil, which is a south Indian language maybe you’ve sung unbeknownst to you, if you’re an MIA fan. The music we sourced for the teaser is all beats from Tamil folk and Tamil movie songs with a bit of MIA thrown in. MIA is a big star in the West but essentially she samples a lot of tamil folk. But how many people know what “KUTHU” music is? Tamil movie songs use a lot of it, and I grew up listening to a lot of that music along with songs from “Bollywood” which is essentially the Hindi movie industry – Hindi being India’s national language.  Oh and do you know the Tamil movie industry is called Kollywood – YIKES!,Spicy details reflect how screwed up perceptions and expectations are…Indian films love light skinned actresses despite majority of India being of a darker skin tone. We are so obsessed with light skin that Indian films cast American and European actresses for roles of South Asian women…We continue to teach generation after generation of young Indian women to idealize and desire that. Straight hair and size zero are the in thing now.,The career of an actress ends at 25 but male actors at the age of 60 can still play a hip college student. Yes it’s a misogynistic world. But once your career of a film actress ends at 25, there’s always the world of television soap operas!!!,Also Bollywood loves TWITTER! Every single person in the industry tweets. Indians love tweeting! Being the second largest populated country in the world, that’s a lot of tweets…So that’s why Lady Gaga famously tweeted “ Who cares for Hollywood; it’s all about Bollywood.”,[quote]Bollywood loves TWITTER! Every single person in the industry tweets.[/quote],Morocco loves Bollywood!!! When I was traveling there everyone would look at me and my family and ask “Indian?” We would nod yes, and their eyes would light up and then they would proceed to name every actor and actress and film they have seen. It happened all the time!,Bollywood is its own thing and TV serials or soap operas are their own thing. Usually those who don’t make it in Bollywood or whose prime acting years in movies are a thing of the past, find themselves producing or acting as leads in soap operas. I think Bollywood soap opera is a whole new genre thanks to ,We took all the drama and multiplied it twice. It’s going to be lethal! [She's laughing.],But I have to say that if you watched some of the Bollywood movies from the ’70s or even earlier, the kind of arcs in the story – the way the actors emote, it’s all very melodramatic and theatric. You might not see this melodrama in everything that comes out of Bollywood these days.,What’s typical in serials is there is always one central character. I have noticed it’s more women-centric; its almost always about daughters-in-law, mothers-in-law and about big joint families where generations of the family live together so there is more possibility for drama. There has to be an evil mother in law or sister in law or step mother, or sometimes all three. Someone is always plotting to do something evil, but good always prevails. Like all telenovelas, there are dramatic pauses, an over-emphasis just to make sure you get the point. You could stop watching a serial in 2008 and get back to watching the 1000, episode in 2010 and still not miss a thing. But as I was sifting through the millions of serials being produced these days in India, I came across this latest bunch of soap operas that blew my mind! One of them is literally adapted from the Twilight movies! It’s not overly tacky, actually it’s very slick. And yes all the actors and actresses look like they could be in Hollywood – young light skinned, westernized standards of beauty, wearing skinny jeans, texting incessantly about boys and vampires.,EM TEE! [She's laughing]. You have to admit that she’s the one creating any kind of interest or conversation around the subject, right? Who knows…You might be walking down Morgan one day, and a bunch of people might break out into a dance!,I think it’s appropriate to have something that is about this whole struggle and the love/hate relationship between all the different art world players, happen in a place like Bushwick. At this time a lot is going on here. Artists and even the immigrant population who have been living here longer than the artists can hopefully relate to the story. It’s all about how we adapt, and who can adapt to these cyclical changes, and about the self-awareness that we all have about making it or getting left behind…The Bogart Salon’s programming also addresses all these issues. Being a gallery space in Bushwick and showing the work in the context of the space only seems natural to further the conversation…,Essentially the story is about the journey of a South Asian immigrant woman through the art world and her quest to make it “big”. So we see what it is like for her to get to America, get an education, intern and work in auction houses and galleries and find her “voice”. We also see the relationships she builds – both professional and personal. It is about being a woman and balancing work and family – the role of wife, mother, daughter and what that is like when there are certain cultural expectations in the mix from family and society. Especially in an industry that’s not “typical”, stable and still more of a man’s world.,I’m also interested in addressing the broader perceptions within and outside the art world, like the idea of an “immigrant” or being a “woman of color” or being “brown”. I moved to the US when I was 23 and until that point I was never categorized under any of those terminologies. The burden of those signifiers is kind of thrown at you merely because it’s just easy, and that’s what you “see”.,, has a main narrative thread that will be told in the language of soap operas in India. The role of Isha is played by Em Tee, which is an alternative reality some part of me exists in.,The idea is to talk about all the politics in a bizzare, absurd way so you are left questioning the veracity of the whole story. Is this REALLY a true story? Did all that really happen? Is that how it works? And yet there would be parts that, hopefully, people can relate to from their own experiences. The main narrative also breaks into Meta Narratives. We see slippage of race and reality with fantasies and performances all tied in.,I’m not casting professional actors but those who work or have some kind of connection to the art world. If they happen to be actors, great! The deeper dynamics of their place in, and relationship to the art world, that’s important to me. I’m casting  friends, family, colleagues, former bosses maybe…For instance Seema and Sunil who play Isha’s dad and mom, are parents of an artist whose work I admire and is my dear friend, Swati Khurana. The moment where the actors step out of the scripted role and talk about who they are and why they felt they could work in this film is very important for the meta narratives.,Furthermore, we wanted to push the story telling beyond just one linear narrative. We will be filming parts of the soap opera in spring at the Salon. We will create/transfer the sets there, so that people can see the actual filming and become part of the narrative. Another part of the gallery will screen the episodes already filmed and edited. So you are a viewer and a participant. The end is left open so that many endings, and therefore many more stories, can be told., ,, our favorite neighborhood disc jockeys, , and image with flying colors! I sat down with Colin, one of the founders of the station, who told me to expect a lot to come, including a whole lot of new ,Newtown Sessions is a series of video features of emerging indie bands and musicians created in-building.  Newtown Sessions are recorded downstairs in the Swan 7 recording studios, then moving upstairs to broadcast the session, all in the complex, on the East end of Meserole, which has been called “,” by The L Magazine.,One of the most recent sessions features , one of my personal favorite ,bands out there.  Lower Dens is the brain project of ,, the folk-based songwriter, whose voice is remarkably husky and archaic at the same time. Her work in the band brings a whole new life to her songwriting- the music is sometimes droney, with an oceanic reverb that makes your spine tingle, gaining a weird-fi heaviness that is absolutely beautiful. Their first LP, ,, remains one of my favorite albums to listen to, and there’s much build-up for their new album, ,, which comes out May 1st.,Needless to say, everyone involved must have been really excited to do a session with Lower Dens.

"Bushwick was AGAIN exploding with art openings this past weekend, and the famous studio building on the border of Bushwick and Ridgewood, 17-17 Troutman didn’t get left behind.  The second gallery in the building after the excellent , Parallel Art Space opened on Saturday night. , is a successor of ,, a quirky gallery that used to be located in East Williamsburg. , you some time ago about the move of the collective to 17-17 Troutman studio building.,Rob de Oude and Enrico Gomez of Parallel Art Space share an amazing studio that immediately neighbors their new gallery. Rob de Oude told us previously that they are looking to build a space smaller but cleaner space than Camel used to be. He also told us that they used to work a lot with guest curators at Camel but at Parallel they are excited to curate for a while themselves.,The result of their endeavor is truly amazing. Parallel Art Space doesn’t owe anything to its name, which references geometry, among other things. The space is pristine, the walls are beautifully made, and the angles are perfectly right.,Furthermore, their inaugural exhibition was fabulous. ,is a carefully crafted group show featuring some of the most promising artists from Brooklyn (Clinton King, Lance Lankford, Gary Petersen, Suzanne Stroebe, and Andrew Zarou) who in their art engage in exploring minimalism in different degrees. Perfect composition pleasing one’s brain was the dominant feel to , on Saturday night., , , , ,[mappress mapid=""59""], in Bushwick has a beautiful layout with multiple playgrounds, grass areas, and wide brick walkways to a large, circular center.  Benches and ledges line the perimeter of this area, and extend throughout the entire park.  People relax, play chess, buy ices, fruits, and food from vendors.  It is a wonderful place to be, and provided a welcome reception for the first of the weekly Sunday afternoon ,!,We sat upon benches in the center of the park, and were joined by friends as we all built the sound.  ,- a great list of instruments that were traded around and shared throughout the jam.  The busy park made for a large audience and many walked over, grooved a bit, and joined right in.  A gentleman working at the park asked to join, and had some skills on djembe!  The highlight of the gathering was seeing the children give the instruments a try and play along.  They were all so excited, and all said thank you, as they were thrilled to get to try the drums out.  Really great vibes when jammin’ together, ya know?  :),Looking very forward to next week’s!  A great first session, and a real privilege to get to play in the park with so many friends on such a beautiful day.  Thanks to everyone, and spread the word!, , , , ,[mappress mapid=""58""],Industrial wasteland, residential streets, the people who live here, amazing street art on the walls…. There is something about Bushwick that makes a camera lens very attracted to it. As a result, many photographers have been inspired to photograph the neighborhood. Some of them are doing particularly excellent job. Here are 6 we love, in alphabetical order., , ,‘s Mixtape- Drum Along!,This week’s mix contains African tracks, selected for their captivating groove and rhythm elements.  I drum along to these tracks to practice djembe, sing along, and dance around.  The key ingredient is the pulsing repetition that draws us to move or express, the patterns we hear that repeat and invite us to contribute our voices.,Communal drumming has always fascinated me, surely because I didn’t grow up in a place where it was a custom.  I began drumming in school as a child, but I can remember specifically when I first experienced the magic of a drum circle.  While in high school, I had a music teacher who brought in his djembe and began adding this element to our regular snare drum/concert percussion regimen.  He and I planned to jam a bit during a lunch period, so we got a large music room, shut the door, and turned off the lights.  We began tapping out rhythms and ideas, repeating each other, calling and responding, cueing different dynamics, and GOT LOST IN IT.  Somewhere in this session, everything aligned and became an action being driven by a different part of the mind, if you will.,While drumming and listening, many parts of the brain work simultaneously and stimulate feelings and associations that become the result of this orchestra of brainwork.  ”Grooving” describes this reaction by our minds, compelling us to drop certain activities in areas of the brain for a welcome use of the parts that can “harmonize”.  Once there is this rhythmic harmony of brain activity, there is a dissociation from inhibitions and anxiety.  This teacher and I were drumming and deeply in sync, but the bell rang after what felt like a few minutes, though it had been an entire 40 minute journey through a state of mind that is limited by the words we have to attempt to describe it.,This was one of the most important sessions I have had of any kind, and led me to study these elements further.  When musicians find this element while playing, it breathes fresh motivation into our efforts because it reminds us of the key ingredient that compelled our efforts initially.  This brainwork is familiar to all artists, performers, entertainers, thinkers, writers, etc., and exploring this harmony of thoughts, expressions, and emotions provides us with a common devotion and intention, making for a very catalytic mix of energy!,A drum circle is a concentrated study on this exact brain energy.  Positive vibes, friendly exchanges, community expression, and the effort of a whole group to attain this rhythmic harmony makes it a recipe for magic.,Hope to see you all there!  And if this Sunday doesn’t work for you, fear not!  We’ll be out there every Sunday at 1pm, weather permitting.,Maria Hernandez Park, Brooklyn, NY,ALL WELCOME!,Babatunde Olatunji- What’s Your Number, Mama?,Bola Johnson & His Easy Life Top Beats- Ezuku Buzo,Tinariwen- Tenere Taqqim Tossam,Tom Diakite- Fala,Babatunde Olatunji- Love Drum Talk,Fela Kuti- Gentleman,Tinariwen- Amassakoul ‘N’ Tenere,Babatunde Olatunji- Sare Tete Wa,Spring is upon us, Bushwick.

We stopped by a couple of days ago when the construction was still in progress, so we can tell you the space is lovely! The first exhibition at Parallel Art Space is titled Alter Minimal – Lexicon Series Vol. 1 and will feature the works by Clinton King, Lance Lankford, Gary Petersen, Suzanne Stroebe, and Andrew Zarou.,You know that spring is definitely here, when you hear a drum circle from Maria Hernandez Park.

The key idea of the drum circle is to  relax, listen, make friends, and to enjoy our beautiful community!, , ,Bushwick-based non-profit for collaborative arts, ,, is currently finishing their works on a new ballet, ,. New ballet explores the relationship between human brain and human mind; ventures into neuroscience and delves into it through dance. Loyal to its mission to collaborate across the arts, Norte Maar’s Jason Andrew (production) and Julia Gleich (choreography) invited several visual and sound artists to contribute their ideas and their art. As a result of the broad collaboration, , is a gracious hybrid between dance, video and sound art.  Julia Gleich told us that the concept of the ballet was born through the talks with several Bushwick artists that included Paul D’Agostino, Roarke Menzies, Andrew Hurst, Audra and Margo Wolowiec, Dennis Pelli, Lawrence Swan among others, and naturally Jason Andrew. The ballet is musically produced by composer Ryan Francis.,On Friday morning, I attended the rehearsal of the ballet in progress at the , in Williamsburg in an attempt to capture its essence and several photographs.

The tickets are only $25 ($20 if you’re a student or a senior) and can be purchased ,., , , , , ,Sure, we have Pratt in Clinton Hill, but what about the concept of alternative education that fits in perfectly with the aesthetic and DIY nature of the Bushwick/Brooklyn arts scene? Here are 5 of our favorite Brooklyn institutions that offer education without binding yourself to a 4-year, debt-inducing degree program.,This past Sunday, the Loom in Bushwick was teeming with enthusiastic artists, musicians, and the like who chose to put the April Fooleries on hold as the , opened its doors to the public for the first time with the group show BORN. Nyssa Frank, the curator and director of the Living Gallery, transformed the space from a jungle of sculptures and debris into what is now a hub for anything from live music to densely curated art shows to an alternative and quirky classroom.,Nyssa has been contacting the local talent in search of those interested in teaching classes in her new space, for an affordable rate in a comfortable environment. The classes currently being offered are ,, ,, Children’s Mask Making,  Canvas Stretching, Paper Making, Comic Illustration, and more. Nyssa’s vision is to offer the community an accessible, affordable, and fun way to learn and meet the talented individuals that inhabit this booming neighborhood. I highly suggest stopping in to check out the show that is up at the moment as well as reading up on the details of each class and considering signing up for one!,3rd Ward on Morgan Avenue has been expanding at an unbelievable rate since its inception in 2005. They offer over 100 classes on anything from web design to circuitry to language courses for artists. They even have a class on how to make “badass bike lights.” Additionally, 3rd Ward offers various photography studios,  wood/metal/jewelry-making shops, and memberships as well.,The BAG is well known for its high quality of educators and range of courses. Some offered are DIY printmaking, watercolors, color theory, finding artist opportunities, and oil painting. They even have a non-instructed figure drawing class with a live model.,Located off the Graham stop on the L train, Vaudeville Park has been offering workshops in addition to consistently putting on shows of all kinds for the past few years. At the moment, the non-profit venue is hoping for enough interested participants to propose workshops in order to begin offering them regularly again. One hopeful program is a summer band camp for young children.,When speaking about alternative education, a mention to Brooklyn Brainery is a must. Despite being located in Carroll Gardens, it is worth the commute from Bushwick. The Brainery is a community-driven hub of teachers and students who simply want to learn something new for the cost of a few Williamsburg iced-coffees. Some classes include American History, Weird Spices, Calligraphy, How to Make Menthol Candy Cigarettes, Songwriting, and How to Find the Perfect Rental (I think we can all benefit from this one especially.), , ,Athina Skermo refused to sit down.,She walked through her diner and wiped down the fake wooden tabletops that were one shade brighter than the wood paneling throughout the space. Skermo, 60, was well into the fifth hour of her workday by 8:30 a.m.,“I threw my back out yesterday,” she said as she pushed a chair under one of the tables. “If I sit down, I won’t get back up.”,And this was just a Monday morning, she said with a smile.,Skermo said her diner’s been as busy now as it ever was, but she admitted that Tina’s Place hasn’t been immune to a slow-moving economy.,Her customers, however, agreed that her affordable menu makes it the only diner in Bushwick where warehouse workers and afterhours partygoers alike can get short stacks with bacon and coffee for less than $6 and on the table in less than eight minutes.,Tina’s Place sits at 1002 Flushing Ave. and across the street from the Boar’s Head factory. Skermo and her husband bought the diner 41 years ago. One of Skermo’s relatives first opened the diner in the 1930s. She kept the odd hours – from 3:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. – to better accommodate the neighboring warehouse’s operating hours.,Since she first opened, Boar’s Head opened up its own cafeteria, which she was afraid would pull business. At the same time, Williamsburg’s urban middle class started to settle around Tina’s Place in what used to be considered an industrial area.,But Skermo said that she welcomed the changes. Her regulars still visit her, and the new residents bring with them a night life that keeps her Saturday night shifts teeming with customers as they dry up from their last call after 4 a.m.,“It’s our busiest night,” Skermo said. “It’s always full now.”,Earlier in the day, truck driver Joe Nix sat at a table near the counter, and looked over a clipboard that held a stack of spreadsheets. He hadn’t been to Tina’s Place in more than two years and said he decided to stop by today before going back to the warehouse.,He had already finished his plate of eggs with bacon, and said he could count on Skermo’s food to be as dependable as her hospitality.,“It’s still as good as it was two years ago,” he said.,Meanwhile, Joe Martinez walked in and sat on a stool at the far end of the counter. A supervisor at Boar’s Head, Martinez worked at the warehouse for 12 years and used to visit Skermo regularly. He took a break from the job but recently came back. He said that he wasn’t surprised to see Skermo still at it.,“Thought you’d retire by now,” Martinez said.,“For 40 years I’ve been saying the same thing,” Skermo responded.,“Remember Pete?” he asked.,Martinez then told Skermo that his former coworker who used to visit Skermo had retired and moved to North Carolina.,“So many people have left,” she said.,Martinez said that Boar’s Head cafeteria wasn’t always open during his shift, which meant that he stopped by Tina’s Place about twice a day. It didn’t hurt, he said, that Skermo keeps the prices low.,“You can get a full breakfast here for under $3,” he said.,Three dollars at Tina’s can actually go pretty far. For less than the price of a small latte at Starbucks, customers before 11 a.m. can get either two eggs any style or pancakes, both with their choice of sausage, ham or bacon, toast or potatoes, and juice or coffee.,The beverage is extra after 11.,Isabelle Davis, a twentysomething in thick-rimmed glasses who moved into the neighborhood about a year ago, sat in the back of the diner with her friend. When she’s not working at her office manager job, she moonlights as a program director for an online radio station.,Even as Williamsburg’s brunch scene creeps toward Bushwick with gourmet Bloody Marys and fancy baked eggs, Davis said Tina’s Place was consistent and not ironic in any way. She appreciated it as one of the few places left in the neighborhood where everyone could feel welcome and at home.,“A lot of new places don’t cater to such a wide socioeconomic net,” Davis said as she finished her $2 egg and cheese on a roll. “You see all kinds of folks here. Tina’s is an every day sort of place.”, ","

"‘s Mixtape- SPRING CLEANING MIX,Spring is a great time to reflect and feel motivated to move forward. This week’s mix of soulful house and love tracks will keep the Spring vibes flowing.,We got rid of lots of clothes too, which is like shedding skin.  Dusted every inch of the place.  Dogs are shedding their coats, too.,Sigh, I love cleaning.  LOVE IT.  Like a hamster loves his wheel.,Todd Terje- Inspector Norse,Tortured Soul- Fall In Love,Solu Music featuring Kimblee- Fade,Ananda Project- Falling For You,Kaskade- It’s You, It’s Me,Jamiroquai- Little L,Waldorf- You’re My Disco,Daft Punk- Digital Love,Crazy Penis- There’s a Better Place!, Event though Bushwick scruffiness is lovable, sometimes it’s nice to get all fancy. And if it’s for a good cause, than there is even more of a reason. On Monday night, supporters of , from Bushwick and elsewhere, all gathered at , gallery in Chelsea for a benefit night of this Bushwick-based non-profit organization. The night honored , of E.A.T. who was introduced by a noted curator Barbara London. After Julie Martin received an award made by Bushwick sculptor Ben Godward, we enjoyed David Tudor’s , performed by ,, and a preview of Norte Maar’s upcoming ballet , ,The evening was simply lovely, even outside of our beloved pigeon town, and as it is unclear when we will be able to witness Bushwick artists in fancy attire again, here is a little photo documentation of the special occasion…., , , , , , , , ,   ,   , , , , ,For the third time already, an artist couple , and Joe Ballweg organized an art show at Joe’s Ridgewood studio. Joe works in an amazing, lofty space at the ground floor of his house at Woodward Ave. In addition, he has access to a lovely backyard, and so the decision to use his studio every three months or so for a pop up art show is a really good one. , featured eight artists (Gina Beavers, Chris Dunlap, Matthew Fisher, Elisa Lendvay, Margrit Lewczuk, Matthew Mahler, Alan Prazniak, Adam Parker Smith) and consisted largely of paintings.,The featured artwork was fresh, colorful and often quirky – a great sample of what’s being made in hundreds of artists studios in the Bushwick/Ridgewood area.,Adam Parker Smith is making large pieces by sewing together hundreds of friendship bracelets. We saw another of his pieces a couple of weeks ago at , art show at Bobby Redd Projects (the famous ,).,Matthew Mahler is a co-owner of another cool Ridgewood art space, ,. His newer pieces are dark as night, and we dig them.,Matthew Fisher is studio-mates with Matthew Mahler, but he paints very differently. These four pieces play with a desert plant embracing the sun in four different ways., ,I really like the simple idea of this DIY endeavor. Clean up the studio, invite artists, invite friends, bring your own drinks, look at art and have fun! The turnout at the third art show at Joe Ballweg’s studio was pretty huge, and so was the fun in the studio and at the subsequent afterparty at Gottscheer Beer Hall., , ,[mappress mapid=""57""],Every new week in Bushwick is a reason to celebrate: we have a bunch of awesome events organized by creative Bushwick folks coming up. But before we walk you through the five of them we like the most this week, please enjoy the opportunity to listen to this this one-man a cappella multitrack version of the , theme song….,On Wednesday night, a Bushwick non-profit organization based in 56 Bogart building, ,, will be screening some classics to accompany the current art exhibition , of Anna Carossa. The 1963 film , was directed by Don Chaffey. Don’t miss this cult film based on Greek mythology and the ’60s special effects. Moreover, the admission is free!,So @, told us on , that she just moved to the neighborhood and asked us about the first thing she should do.  And we said go to Centotto on Friday! Centotto, my dear friends, is a legendary apartment gallery run by ,, a sophisticated curator who like likes to explore interesting concepts, usually following from a piece of good reading. This Friday, Centotto will open an art show consisting of 12 men exploring the beasts within.,While on Moore Street for Centotto opening, check out another great loft right in the building next door, ,. Paper Swan Loft belongs to the collective of musicians, filmmakers and artists from Bushwick,who are, this Friday night, hosting poets Matthew Zingg, Gina Mobilio, Mike Lala,  Julie Kantor. The nights at Paper Swan Loft are always a really really pleasant experience, after which you won’t be able to hide a (rather silly) smile on your face for days. Aaah…, mixer no. 2 will be held at popular coffee shop , this Thursday! The most compelling reasons why you should attend are: 1) you need to attend at least one of the mixers to receive a registration code for your studio participation at BOS; 2) BOS mixers are always FUN!; 3) Little Skips is undergoing an interesting reconstruction and is being turned into even cuter place it already is.,opened only one year ago, but instantly became one of the most popular spots in the neighborhood. Delicious food, great selction of wine and beer, friendly staff- all that participated to the fact that Bushwick loves Ghia, and we won’t miss their birthday party!, ,Complete event listings for this week can be ,., on Troutman Street has tranformed since you may or may not have visited pre-March-2012. At the time, the , had a undercooked DIY feel that was memorable and funky feeling, but overall felt kind of cold. The space certainly felt hip, but wasn’t the cozy nook it tried to be with half-hearted plants and decoration due to the cement walls and floor and dark interior with no natural light. But, oh, how the times have changed!,The Body Actualized center re-opened last Saturday with a trippy rager sampling everything Bushwick needs and wants on a regular basis, in a permanent space. The festivities featured , (wink, wink).  The space has also tranformed- beautiful wooden floors and a tiki-hut style entryway were hand built by volunteers, founders, and friends of the space. A storefront with huge windows now overlooks the street, and if you came between 8 and 10, you probably saw the intensely-painted man  chunky black-and-white swirls enveloping his flesh.,Brian Sweeney, one of the founders of the space, gave a short and sweet speech in the middle of the evening, encouraging everyone to let loose and “let down their egos”-  an invitation to really just let it all hang out and an opportunity to thoroughly connect with fellow partygoers. Most of this connecting happened on the dance floor that surrounds the center’s new performance elevated stage, illuminated by churning NXT LVL visuals.  Ample seating- wooden benches, leather couches, and floor cushions- provided space for the party’s prevalent people-watching scene (costumes, drag, facepaint, clip on ears and a sea of denim jackets.),The best part of The Body Actualized Center’s makeover is  a complete overhaul of the outdoor space, centered on a close-knit firepit and log-seating for about twenty people. There’s also a double decker roof overlooking the backyard on one end and Troutman street on the other. Oh, it was a beautiful feeling to peer down onto the bonfire, dangling my legs from the low-hanging roof, the softly-misting rain slowly sinking onto the wood around me. The music, the conversation, the firey aroma and the BYOB beer- Body Actualized Center provides the BEST vibes ever.,Now that the center has gained some recognition- the party was POPPIN’ and a New York Times reporter was present- their presence is sure to expand in Bushwick. Yoga classes begin on April 2nd and the space will continue to host (at least!) monthly parties and other events celebrating their wackiness. For more information, check out their , and like ‘em on ,.,Merry Friday, peeps! It’s been almost a year, since the greatest event in our town, , 2011! All volunteer organization Arts in Bushwick is bracing itself for another giant, self-curated festival. Here is a checklist of 10 things you should before the madness begins., BOS were loosely born of ,or ,, which was an art festival held annually in early 2000s featuring art, video, live music and DJs. This year Bushwick Open Studios are celebrating their ,! Happy birthday!, This year’s BOS will be held on ,!, BOS is a ,; you won’t be a subject to any scrutiny or submission process in order to get in.

Arts in Bushwick is always looking for , and it’s only up to you how much you wish to be involved. That’s sort of the most amazing thing about the festival. It is a festival of all of us! Organized by Bushwick for Bushwick to shine!, The nearest opportunity to volunteer involves ,! On Saturday, Arts in Bushwick is inviting everyone to help them flyering. Here is the , Schedule:,
jojo’s Mixtape- NYC Block Party,Ingredients: Brooklyn, a dash of Jersey, Yonkers, and Queens.,This week’s mix is a set of raw and dirty hip-hop from late 90′s to early 2000′s.,These tracks are anthems in and around New York, and are best served with the windows open and the volume UP.  Some make me bounce, some make me sing, and some make me feel like I’m about to roll someone, or get rolled.  And that’s why we love NY-  explicit, raw, and alive, vice and virtue.,Now smash a bottle on the curb, punch your best friend in the face, and sing along!,Brooklyn ZOO!,Mos Def- Body Rock,Digable Planets- Nickel Bags,Notorious B.I.G.- Juicy,Mobb Deep- Shook Ones, Pt. II,Fugees- Fu-Gee-La (Sly & Robbie Mix),Smif-n-Wessun- Bucktown,Black Star- Definition,DMX- Ruff Ryders’ Anthem,Ol’ Dirty Bastard- Brooklyn Zoo,Mos Def- Brooklyn,Crooklyn Clan- Rap Club Mix,Notorious B.I.G.- Brooklyn’s Finest,Beastie Boys- No Sleep Till Brooklyn,“Bushwick collage is not only popular, but increasingly amazing!” This was my conclusion recently made after numerous art-exploring adventures in Bushwick.  Collage being a combination of elements from different sources reflects the time we live in so accurately. Magazines, postcards, fliers… Stimuli coming at us from every direction, combined with artists’ own imaginary world reflect everyday subconscious battle with overload of impulses. While some artists work with physical elements and cut outs, others work with images compiled exclusively from the Internet, and create collages in Photoshop. I believe that this speaks loud about the spirit of the time, and the vanishing importance of print and physical objects in favor of the Internet…,Here is a selection of 10 extraordinary artists from the Bushwick area who work in collage listed in alphabetical order.,., ,.,[quote]Personally, I’ve been in the luckiest situation, surrounded by amazing art, living with it every day. [/quote],At 18 Michael Kronenberg moved to New York to study naked people at Parsons School of Design. He lived through several art scene collapses including the 80’s East Village downfall and the mallification of SoHo. After a divorce he moved to Bushwick when it was still an cachet free post industrial wasteland, taking advice from the “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Gallery” which is to say “Don’t panic.” He has been a Bushwick resident for most of the past eight years, hiding in plain sight a block from the Dekalb stop at 950 Hart Street during this time.,Kronenberg’s art is a reflection of his personality, spirituality and energy.,“The Garden of Eve” a painting completed in 2011 serves as a symbolic guide to the personalities of over 25 people who have resided in his space as couch surfers or roommates. The artists, musicians and models who have come into his life at perpendicular angles have added their energetic contributions to numerous drawings and paintings that litter his studio. It speaks to his ability to put the people in his life in perspective and also let them know that he notices them. He has advised numerous artists at different points in their careers.,One goal he always hoped to meet, was to run an art gallery. The blooming of the Bushwick art scene, which has pumped air into the tires of the neighborhood, allowed him this chance.,In 2010 he and a group of artists at , joined other apartment galleries such as Norte Maar and Centotto. The hard working crew at 950 Hart have put on 21 shows in the past 14 months and have been invited to join , on March 10th, a Bushwick gallery walk put together by Jason Andrew.,It’s been a little over a year since he began the art experiment known as 950 Hart Gallery. With the help of Antoinette Johnson, Mikki Nylund and Sean Alday (disclaimer: this is a true story, I was there) he began a community art experience focused on the love of art.  This is an assessment of that year from a personal standpoint as well as a gentle reminder for anyone who cares about art: Don’t Panic.,[quote]In chaotic times we can take advantage of the general confusion to be completely free to do absolutely anything that we want to do. We battle daily to preserve the space, and try to enjoy the cumulative adrenaline rush that comes from fighting against fear and lack of resources. [/quote],Two trains of thought are running through my head at this point, fear of disaster and a quiet confidence that if we can hold our intentions we can accomplish virtually anything.,In chaotic times we can take advantage of the general confusion to be completely free to do absolutely anything that we want to do. We battle daily to preserve the space, and try to enjoy the cumulative adrenaline rush  that comes from fighting against fear and lack of resources.,I personally feel that my work is in transition of late. Running this space and managing egos and expectations has taken away from my art making time.,Artists hold a mirror up to the face of God so he can admire his reflection.,My family history belongs to storytellers, religious types and refugees.,I’m telling my stories when I draw. I’m painting my personal worlds when I paint. I’m a Buddhist, a lapsed Buddhist [laughs], and the influence of my meditation practice on my art practice is considerable. I look for things that can be hard to see if I don’t keep my mind’s eye open.,In practicing my drawing and painting I’ve finally come to a place where I’m not thinking when I work, my work exists and I exist.,I love German Expressionism and Tibetan Iconography.,Christian Schaad and Alice Neel understood that there’s an endless battle between inner life and what you actually see. I’m influenced by a large number of artists, from old masters to 20th Century cartoonists. I’m also inspired to work harder by people we show [in 950 Hart Gallery], I get a terrific charge when they get it right.,Chance encounters are also extremely powerful. Jim Herbert has been one of my personal heroes. I remember watching his videos, discovering his photo-books and his paintings. We went to the English Kills show last year, and talked with him about his work. That’s inspiring to me, he’s in his seventies and is painting like a master.,Well, I’ve been going to shows in the neighborhood for the most part lately. I like figurative work, and I encourage that in our space because it needs to have a forum. The Bushwick aesthetic of “found art” or “recycled art” is interesting as well. That is, when it’s done with some aesthetic consideration it can be very interesting.,Paul’s show [Appearance Adrift in the Garden] at Norte Maar is in line with that aesthetic. He has the chops to back it up and make it engaging, which I respect.,I always look for something that is emotionally expressive. Some people go internal like Antoinette [Johnson] and some go external like Grant [Stoops]. There are circumstances and stimuli that form around the artists work that engage different viewers on different levels. We try very hard to have art that is engaging and emotional.,What makes people like Nick Greenwald interesting is the execution of their mark-making and the attitude they express. It’s simple. It’s raw emotion versus emotional rawness, like painting versus photography.,[quote]There is a definite decline in the level of craftsmanship in some of the stuff I’ve been seeing out and about. This could be a misguided attempt at modesty, the result of ADD or the latest attempt at irony.[/quote],A painting is many different things. It’s an object in three dimensional space that exists, it’s a crystallization of the artist’s Chi that went into it. The best paintings, or the ones that interest me most, are the purest distillation of the artist’s life force.,That’s what most photography can never have. A photograph is a reflection, with photography it’s mostly the  case that what you see through your device is what you get. In painting, it’s not like that. Painting relies on the conviction of internal vision. Painting is ruthless [laughs], because, what’s in your head may not be that interesting, or you may not have the craft it takes to communicate what’s there. Photography is always one step removed from where your head is, whether it’s staged or digitally manipulated, it depends on a plastic device to some degree.,When it comes to photography I like Worm [Carnevale], he’s as close to painting as a photographer can get. He is relentless in exploring how to make an conventional photograph more personal.  You look at his work and it’s like looking into his mind. What you see in there may freak you out, and that’s what makes it so interesting.,There is a definite decline in the level of craftsmanship in some of the stuff I’ve been seeing out and about. This could be a misguided attempt at modesty, the result of ADD or the latest attempt at irony.,I am also heartily sick of art that comments on the social media phenomenon.,Personally, I’ve been in the luckiest situation, surrounded by amazing art, living with it every day. We’ve carefully curated this gallery to show positive artwork and I think we have been successful at it, but we can always do more. I want 950 Hart Gallery to continue expanding and growing and I look forward to meeting and showing more new artists, and expanding the available options for our existing crew.,What’s the future of this space? I don’t know, we could all be evicted. I think that we have to acknowledge that this has been an immense labor of love which came at great cost to the chief operators, both in treasure and in emotional strain.,So let’s look at where it got us. One of the most amazing years of my life. Antoinette, Mikki and I have produced incredible bodies of work given what we had. You’ve documented this whole process and probably have enough material for a series of novels.,Have the benefits outweighed the costs? Well, yes and I’m not panicking.,Happy Monday! Before you take a breath to start the new week in the beloved pigeon-town, brace yourself for these 5 amazing events this week that shall under no circumstances be omitted in your social and cultural calendar.,Also note that 3 of 5 top weekly events are on Wednesday! But don’t worry, inhale, exhale, heeeeere we go, Wednesday!,I can’t believe it’s been almost a year since we wrapped up last year’s Bushwick Open Studios. The most amazing festival in Bushwick and possibly on the entire planet, edition 2012, is almost here! The first of the community mixers is coming up this Wednesday at ,. Arts in Bushwick volunteers will be answering your questions, and assigning registration codes to participating art spaces. If you want to participate, it’s mandatory to attend at least one of the meetings, so why not do it early?,Wednesday late night at the dining room of Northeast Kingdom will be fun! Classical performance by some of the most favorite Bushwick peeps will include Paul Rome, Oliver Ralli and Roarke Menzies for starters. A portion of the night’s proceeds will go to fund , at ,.,We are excited to see that after uber-successful reading series ,, another reading series is launching in ,. H.I.P. is curated by Erin Harris, Brittney Inman, and Kim Perel. The 1st reading will include works of fiction, non-fiction, poetry and also translation.,On Saturday night head to Ridgewood! Joe Balweg and Andrea Bergart have curated their 3rd pop up show at Joe’s studio. These guys have a great taste, and Joe’s studio is simply amazing. Pop in for the pop up show, and enjoy colors and awesome painting from Bushwick/Ridgewood area., is a festival celebrating DIY culture of Brooklyn, collectives, artists and musicians. We wrote about this awesome project earlier ,. In order to make the June festival happened, these guys are raising some funds, and as is a good Bushwick fundraising tradition, a lot of good music and food are involved. This benefit party promises four bands, DJs, performances and free dinner! Sliding donation of $7 to 15 will get you all that topped with a good feeling.","

"This Wednesday, March 28th, a fundraiser for an unusual event is taking place. Head over to Big Snow Buffalo Lodge at 89 Varet St. in Bushwick to see ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, a featured film by Heather Craig, and a mesmerizing dance performance by the ,. And if these phenomenal artists are somehow not enough to get you to what we think is one of the best venues in Bushwick, there will be free dinner served from 8-9pm, so don’t be fashionably late (or you’ll be fashionably hungry and disappointed in yourself.) Admission is $7-$15 sliding donation at the door. RSVP on , here.,But how does this show stand apart from the rest of the fabulous shows in our neighborhood? All of the proceeds are going towards funding the ,, and 90% of that money goes directly to the artists participating. The Vis-a-Vis Project is a brand new festival unlike anything that has happened in Brooklyn, and exactly what it needs. The project will be happening in June, so stay tuned for more information about performers and artists as the date approaches. Below is an interview between myself and Rachael Pazdan, the founder and director of the project, and an all-around nifty chick.,A cosmic make-out session in your parents basement between all DIY artists, collectives and spaces in Brooklyn.,Nothing like this has been done before here. It’s more than coming together for a party, show, or opening; it’s about cultivating local artists and exhibiting their work with monetary support behind it.,We are attempting to bring together ALL arts collectives and groups that exist in Brooklyn + DIY space groups/owners to meet each other and talk about new ideas, collaborations, issues they face within DIY culture and how to resolve them.,On the 3, night, we are curating an interdisciplinary performance inviting over 20 collectives and artists in Brooklyn (dance, music, video art, film, spoken word, theater, etc.) who will collaborate and use audience interaction. We are using 93% of our budget to PAY all of these artists so that they may continue to create.,RP: While non-profit arts organization struggle to stay a float, DIY artists and venues in Brooklyn endure with the bare essentials. The work made is usually better than most things out there right now because of the innovation and creativity that goes behind creating work with essentially nothing, and performing or showing it in a space that is unusual, and sometimes limiting. It’s the attitude of “you can support us or not, you can pay attention or not, it will still be created and be more innovative than anything else out there”. I also am drawn to the sense of community and encouragement amongst the different spaces, artists and collectives in Brooklyn.,There are really 3 major goals with this project:,We want to bridge the gap between the more established collectives in Brooklyn who more or less pioneered the scene circa 2004/2005 with newer emerging spaces and collectives. I want them to meet and connect and collaborate.,The second major goal is to create an atmosphere in this community that is ultra supportive of artists monetarily. We need to fundraise and pay these artists so that they can continue to create and be inspired, and I want to show that it’s possible!,Lastly, I want to bring outside visibility to Brooklyn DIY artists by inviting people at BAM, people at City Center, The Kitchen, college professors, parents, students, and strangers to come experience the performance evening face to face (ahem…see definition: vis-à-vis).,The Compendium, which was started by a few members including Ian Colletti who operates Vaudeville Park do a similar type of festival with curators and artists. But no, I haven’t heard of anything quite like this…fingers crossed!,The goal is to get this going twice a year!,I am excited for the lecture by a few of the members of Punk Drunk/Sleep No More to talk about creative producing at one of the talk back nights. I am also psyched to curate the performance night! It’s all amazing and we’ve had a lot of great support so far, I can only hope for that to grow as the time gets nearer to the festival!,New releases for March 2012- mixed by , on ,.,These tracks are all new releases played at the ,.  For those who aren’t DJs and dance-heads, the Winter Music Conference is a week of focus on the best DJs and dance music on the planet.  Tons of clubs, line-ups, pool parties, panels, you name it, all in the beautiful setting of South Beach, Miami.  DJs drop new releases and the biggest club-fans in the world come out to party.,These new tracks remind me of why I made the trip years ago, buying new releases at record stores, tracking down songs I heard while dancing, and traveling around to hear the best DJs.  This style has always been my main dish, and I serve it with love!  These sounds romanced my passion for rhythm, and compelled me to DJ, dance, sample, tweak, match, blend, and bounce.  Thanks to those making this music, spinning this music, and DANCING to this music!,Nathan G- Come And Get It,Softwar- August,Larse- So Long,Milton Jackson- Dsi,Jonn Hawley- The Get Down,Andre Lodemann- Together,That Kid Chris- Girlfriend (Anthony Acid Remix),Audionite- Combo,Addy Van Der Zwan, Hithouse, Jerry Beke- Jack To The Sound Of The Underground 2012,Airwin Granero & Alex Muller- I’ve Got That Tune,Stereofunk- El Patron,Afrilounge- Gold,Bingo Players- Rattle,DJ Dan- Stereo Damage (DJ Dan & Brian Matrix Remix),Soul Therapy- Already Mine,Strip Steve- Strollin’,Aaron Perez & Matt Soda- Falling Apart,It’s here people!

Festivities with great art – nothing can go wrong!, ,The wooden camel behind the window of , was wearing a festive red cravat that night, and despite it was looking very fancy, I could see the sadness in its eyes. Its days of fame when it stood proudly as the mascot of Camel Art Space ,.  This weekend, Camel Art Space said the last good bye to the space at 722 Metropolitan Ave. Camel Art Space and Tom Marquet took this occasion to threw one last show for us to keep as a memory, or , if you like….,The concept was simple and yet so entertaining and engaging. The artists previously featured in a show at Camel Art Space were asked to create a souvernir of their work, a memento, or an object that one could purchase at a gift shop. Almost 40 artists created fun merchendise following the line of their own work. Postcard, mugs, T-shirts, tote bags… You could tell that the artists had a lot of fun when coming up with their pieces, and this ease in creation made for a really great and fun show. Here is a little sample., , , , , , , , , , Yes, Camel Art Space members made a move to 1717 Troutman building, and started fresh under a new name, ,. They have their 1st show coming up in April, and the rumor says it will be great…!,Last Friday, a tiny storefront previously known as ,, nowadays mainly referred to as ,filled up from wall to wall. And it wasn’t a deadline to file taxes…. Kirk Stoller, a young man from a small farm in Portland, Oregon, was asked by lovely Deborah Brown to exhibit his sculptures and installations in the said premises. And oh yeah, he did. Storefront frequently exhibits paintings, so it was nice to see a less traditional exhibition. Small sculptures were precariously installed on the walls, in the corner, and one was even hanging above the entrance door. The pieces rely on each other for strength, in actual form or through a labyrinth of memories. Kirk uses bright natural colors and variety materials., , , ,In the project room, my heart was overflown with warmth. Bushwick artist Brent Owens curated an intimate show ,as an extension of his own project ,. Brent Owens, Rachael Morrison, David Pappaceno, and Don Pablo Pedro created objects deriving inspiration from the busy, commercial Knickerbocker Avenue in Bushwick. The objects felt familiar as feels a walk on Knickerbcker Ave., , ,I enjoyed what the conceptual shift did to the work of Don Pablo Pedro. This eclectic artist typically paints on a canvases rolled in the papyrus style. His work resembles Egyptian hieroglyphs and Indian mythology amended with the impressions  of his own lucid dreams. Genitalia, multiple heads or limbs, blue, gold, green bodies of his characters who are beautiful as well as disturbing at the same time. Don Pablo Pedro is quite on his own out there, standing and waving from a paradise meadow, while we all are in Bushwick.  In other words, watch out for Pedro, he is blowing out in Bushwick, and might soon blow out also elsewhere. For ,, Pedro created tiny versions of this work. The genitalia on small rolled canvases were tiny too. His work gained additional dimension of humor referring to the dollar stores and small cheap but shiny objects you can easily purchase on Knickerbocker., ,Another piece that captured my attention was ,, a newspaper from 1892. I instatly thought that that’s basically a Bushwick Daily predecessor, and started to read in order to derive inspiration from an old timey source. I was very amused by the article ,informing Bushwickians that Mr. Ramsay of Bushwick Ave is seeking an absolute divorce from his wife Annie, who on “several occasions had departed from her matrimonial obligations in favor of Alexander J. Peck.” Instatnly, I thought: Yeah, a gossip column for Bushwick Daily; who’s dating who; who departed from their matrimonial obligations HA-HAAA!?, , ,I insist you guys go and read , at , at 16 Wilson Ave in Bushwick. , and , in the project room run until April 15, and are both great!, , ,“Everyone loves this shit!!” told me the organizer of Naked Drawing Party that took place on Friday night at McKibbin Lofts. The rules were easy. , as you can. Snow-flake-flight easy….,I popped in late at night/early in the morning, made my camera a way through the scrummage of naked painted bodies. Hundreds of young people from the lofts, nearby projects but also from other parts of Bushwick were all in a great symbiosis enjoying to the max- painting each other, dancing and drinking. Here are my slightly hazy photos…. Naked Painting Party…. only in Bushwick….,MORE PHOTOS:, ,A couple of weeks ago, Steve Siegel published a set of photographs on his ,. This unknown New York photographer went viral within minutes… No wonder. His Flickr album contains hundreds of photographs taken  in the streets of New York City in the 1980s. Steve captured the life of the city in an incredibly compelling way. Subways, kids in the streets of the Bronx, parks… We are bringing a selection of photographs starting with a photo of Bushwick on the top. This captivating photography testimony has been created by a man who says on his Flickr profile that he works as attorney and lives in Bergen County, NJ. He says that ,Enjoy!, ,Springtime in New York- here we go! Spent the morning in the yard with my dogs, where I recorded the sounds you’ll hear at the start of this mix.

Hit Pinkberry on the way back and sat in the park. Headed back to Brooklyn and spun some more.,
As if the day couldn’t get any better, we then hit the bodega around the block and found… wait for it… Black Cherry Ginger Ale!? BOOYA!,

Enjoy your week!,Bushwick is not only a neighborhood in New York. It is a living organism that changes dynamically as the time passes every couple of months. It seems that the emotional landscape of the neighborhood reacts extremely sensitively to any kind of a development; sometimes just an idea is enough. What was true yesterday can be very different tomorrow.,What causes the change?  And more importantly will the change be to the benefit of all of the people living here? I certainly hope so. Is it even possible that everyone benefits from a change? Can you reasonably ask for a neighborhood not to change?  I know that the media are not a direct cause of a change but nobody can deny that they have a huge influence. Mainly, when a source like , drops a word about the neighborhood, a community matter suddenly becomes a matter of interest to the entire city, sometimes even the entire world.,Here are some of the articles that NY Times wrote about Bushwick and what followed after them.,[dropcap],[/dropcap],In March 2006, , brought an , focusing mostly on real estate development in the neighborhood. The Times followed a Bushwick realtor, Tom Le, who described Bushwick as the next new neighborhood where you can still buy a family house for $500K. The article also talks about the first “cool” places that opened in the area: Life Café, Brooklyn Natural, Northeast Kingdom, Archive Café, Chez Bushwick…,You can read about the first artists who came to the neighborhood and remodeled industrial buildings into artist studios. It also mentions a predecessor to Bushwick Open Studios, ,.,At least two dozens of “cool” places opened in the area: restaurants, cafes, bars. Sometimes it seems that a new bar opens every day.,Bushwick Art Project is dead, and we are celebrating 6th birthday of ,, a huge event to promote local art that was born shortly after Brooklyn Art Project ceased to exist.,Oddly enough, you can still buy a family house in Bushwick for $500K. Blame/ thank to the recession of 2008., ,[quote]Perhaps those most affected by a neighborhood’s nextness are the people who are already living there, the people who have been living there for years and are not necessarily looking for a place to install a video-dance piece but are trying to live, maybe even raise children.

The Times visited Cedar House on Bushwick Ave inhabited by young and creative people with lotsa interests. The original resident of Cedar House, Ben Shapiro walked the Times writer through the personal histories of the inhabitants, and thorough the events they organize in  Cedar House. The Times was very excited about these guys.,The line about Bushwick being the coolest place on the planet pissed off several ,. However, I have to second that, and yes, I think Bushwick is still the coolest place on the planet. Maybe not in the Morgantown area anymore, but there is still a lot of cool things and inspiring people living here. Also, places like Cedar House where residents happily open their doors to musicians and artists and fellow Bushwickians still exist.,[quote]Bushwick may not be East Williamsburg. But for those seeking the newest Bohemia, this neighborhood is arguably the coolest place on the planet.  And few places are cooler than the white brick building with black trim that its residents call Cedar House, courtesy of its location on the corner of Cedar Street.[/quote],[dropcap], [/dropcap],Ken Johnson was the first Times critic ever to review an art show in Bushwick. Justen Lada: ,, was a show on view in , gallery. This short write up appeared in ,, the Times art blog, which generally writes about experimental topics (at least according to the Times measures).,After this review, the Times art critics lost fear of Bushwick basement/apartment galleries, and many other art spaces celebrated a write up in NY Times. Absolutely well-deserved. Also nothing sells out a show like a shiny review, therefore in the name of support of local arts, please NY Times, come more often!,[quote]With this lovely, small exhibition, [Justen Lada’s] first solo in a , since 1998, he takes a surprising turn toward simplicity.[/quote], ,[dropcap],[/dropcap], ,Roberta’s, originally a hip low-key pizza place received 2 stars from poshy Times food critic.  The review took us on an amusing journey of what a Times writer thinks of a Bushwick resident’s afternoon (,), but also talked about some interesting facts of the restaurant’s operation and food preparation (,.),Roberta’s used to be great. I will never forget my first time there.  After a photo-assistant gig, I was tired but happy biting into a delicious slice of pizza sitting on a wood bench, and everything felt so Bushwick… Well, this is over now.  Less and less of the reasonable Bushwicians are willing to wait two hours for a table. Also the crowd is not what it used to be… Artists at Roberta’s are more likely to be waiting the tables than having a dinner. Don’t get me wrong, the fame of Roberta’s is well deserved (organic farm, radio station, blah blah), but it’s just too much. It’s not Bushwick anymore.,[quote]Roberta’s pizzas are marvelous things, of no particular geographical provenance.

We all read it and frantically shared on our social media, with a cocktail of feelings (1 part of pride, 1 part of wondering about all the things they got wrong; 1 part wondering what the future of our block will be)., talks about new galleries that sprung all over the neighborhood lately, and dedicates the most of its attention to the 56 Bogart building. In fact the article implies that 56 Bogart is the center of the universe. The building has only recently undergone quite a big transformation. Originally a textile factory was like many other industrial buildings in the neighborhood, turned into an artist studio building, but unlike the rest of the buildings it was turned into a gallery mall in the last 6 months.  A concept unseen in Bushwick, but frequent elsewhere, puts a number of galleries under one roof, has been perceived by the Bushwickians as bitter sweet. On one hand, you can’t deny the energy that a concentration of art spaces brings, and the openings at 56 Bogart tend to be epic.  On the other hand, DIY feel so beautiful about Bushwick, has definitely evaporated when you come in. The galleries at 56 Bogart are still quite cool, but I suggest The Times to venture to an opening at apartment galleries , or , or street art gallery ,. I guarantee crowds comparable to those attending openings at 56 Bogart.,Only time will tell.,[quote]But for now, the center of the action is at 56 Bogart, and as with any gallery nexus, it comes alive during openings.[/quote], , , , ,We at Bushwick Daily are proud to announce the second coming of Bushwick-based radio station, ,! With a whole new website, blog, and weekly live series, the station has re-marketed itself as a force to be reckoned with, in Brooklyn and beyond. I visited their studio over on Meserole street, which was nestled into a dark warehouse neighboring ,, one of the hood’s most buzzed-about new venues. I talked to Colin Ilgen, who runs the station with two partners, Mark Brinda and Tariq Abdus-Sabur, as he discussed Newtown’s history and future., ,The idea of Newtown was conceived by Mark upon returning back to New York from a surfing trip in Costa Rica about three years ago. Founded in a place of calm, the stations current reputation is anything but excellent. The guys rented out their studio and got the ball rolling by bringing fresh, tasteful, and local music to the masses.,The station now is run by 20-30 weekly DJs and boasts over 20 shows playing a huge variety of music and ranging drastically in theme. The shows are like podcasts, except they are in real time, and they are both sassy and informative, with titles to match. ,which runs on Sundays from 7-9pm and features a blend of soulful music- from electronic to r&b and shoegaze with an uplifting energy. ,is a Monday-night punk and hardcore installment which often features live performance and is always laden with satirical commentary. Most interesting is their show ,, which describes itself as a “venue for audio storytellers and sound artists, an opportunity to build, to experiment, to explore with sound and narrative.” Indeed, the show samples a range of sounds and audio effects, in a scattered narrative form that is both interesting, impressive, and unlike anything I’ve heard on the radio before.,The station streams 24/7, and when no DJ is actively spinning, there are intensely concocted playlists, featuring a menage of local Brooklyn musicians, hot tracks off of a large collection of indie music blogs they scour, and “undiscovered classics”- sometimes strange, sometimes feel-good,  but always quality tracks off from obscure vinyls.,Revamping the ,is the station’s new vision for providing high-quality in-studio recordings from A-list indie musicians on the air. The first ever session was a stream of New York’s , performing and aired in the summer of 2010, and soon after featured guests from MillionYoung to Secret Colors.,More recently, , has gathered steam as a forum for live performances. First of all, they moved recording to ,‘s recording studios, which has done wonders for the sound. Secondly, they’ve attracted big names such as Minks, The Beets, and Lower Dens to do sessions. Most recently the featured Bushwick’s own lo-fi psychadelic dreamweavers DIVE, whose session you can watch on ,.,All in all, it’s pretty clear that Newtown is filling a Brooklyn-wide niche as an internet radio station that has its sights set as much more than that. They are picking up and taking their recording equipment down to SXSW starting tomorrow where they will be streaming three live showcases, including two showcases with IMPOSE magazine plut a Death+Taxes / Solid Gold PR day party. For all of you who wish you could experience South By first hand, here’s a pretty good way to pretend you’re there, all from a ,. The first Impose party streams Wednesday night and will feature anny Brown, Mr. eXquire, Main Attracktionz and more. Thursday Afternoon hear Young Prisms, Caveman and more at Death + Taxes showcase. Lastly, Impose’s indie party will stream live featuring Dirty Beaches, Crocodiles and Bleeding Rainbow, along with a handful of other wildcard goodies.,Back in Brooklyn they are hosting an official “re-coming out” ,on March 31st at ,, where they will be “ throwing down with two floors full of aural goodness” featuring some allstar DJs, bands, and of course, the coolest DJs around.,

"Last Saturday night came and went in a flash! With 15 Bushwick art spaces participating in , and additional 10+ in ,, Saturday night was a huge success for artists, curators, galleries, and art-enthusiasts alike. I visited around 15 galleries total across the ‘hood’s sprawling streets and avenues from Morgan to Dekalb. Personal favorites were Forest Ave’s huge, splendid, and flashy ,, which featured the show ,. The exhibit sampled drawing, painting, and sculpture and the most stunning works in the gallery came from ,, who mixed sublime and classical imagery in his large-scale paintings, making them both alarming and intruiging.,On the other end of the spectrum, I thoroughly enjoyed the understated and carefully put-together ,‘s “Go Figure” exhibition deeper into Bushwick. The collection gathered works that examined different methods of creating figurative art. In three rooms bursting with drawings and paintings, they showcased adventurous yet meticulous artworks- favorites coming in fantastical neon portraiture by both , and R, . This gallery was the most local-feeling of all the spaces I visited and is a sure building block in the non-Chelsea Bushwick art scene.,All in all, it was an event that was a perfect opportunity for the community of this neighborhood to get together, enjoy the new works, have a beer, and become inspired by the great energy, praise, and momentum Bushwick’s art scene has gathered.,Despite the art apocalypse that Bushwick has been through this last weekend, we are not taking a week off! Bushwick lives of its amazing events, and this week brings AGAIN some awesome music, art and literature. Here is what you shouldn’t miss.,Tonight, ,, a space small in size, but large in creativity, will bring a musical performance by ZETI and Dunedin Dunedin. Storefront Bushwick’s website promises ,This sounds like a meditative and refreshing evening. Exactly, what Bushwick needs tonight….,Earlier we , you that , is wrapping up up at Metropolitan Ave, and will be moving to 1717 Troutman building on Bushwick/Ridgewood border. We couldn’t be happier to have them closer, but before that let’s all think about the amazing Camel Art Space and all the awesome artists who have shown their work there. Come check out ,, the final, weekend only, art show at Camel.,After much anticipation, the art show in a church is finally happening this Friday. An old Victorian-Gothic Landmark church at 626 Bushwick Ave will reopen this week. The art show will feature some of our favorite Bushwick-based artists such as Don Pablo Pedro, Andrew Ohanesian and William Powhida. Definitely A MUST GO!,A popular Bushwick reading series curated by Eric Nelson and Mike Lala returns this weekend to Bushwick with a special benefit night for Planned Parenthood. The event will feature cartoonists Josh Neufeld and Julia Wertz, poet/cartoonist Bianca Stone and animator Marcie Paper. Fireside Follies is always a guarantee of good literary fun, so go and help the good cause!,In the mood for a curated night of rare 40′s-60′s Noir TV and 16mm film prints? We knew you’d say: , On Friday, head to , for film noir and ”Dark, Brooding Synth Jazz” from the Villains of Vaudeville. No cover, no doubts about how we will spend our Friday night!, ,Since the beginning of the Occupation, there has been a war of perception for Occupiers to fight on two fronts. From some on the right, we are fighting against the simplistic assumption that the Occupation is just a bunch of whining beggars looking for handouts. Others on the left, we are an unserious, misguided nuisance. From my vantage point working within the movement, I believe the Occupation has proven its worth in many ways overlooked by those who haven’t been witnessing it first hand.,Here are four reasons why I’m proud to continue supporting OWS:,I was never a full-time Occupier. Aside from the sleepover organized by ,, I was never able to spend more than a few hours at a time in Zuccotti. After I first visited the park on October 4th, I couldn’t get back enough. I would go on my lunch break, after work, on weekends, usually alone, and more than a few times with my family. Not , in any of that time in the park did I feel like it was an unsafe place to be. I knew that if anyone made me feel threatened, I could always just yell “Mic check! Asshole!”, point to the offending asshole, and consider myself covered. That never happened, but the point is that any reports that Zuccotti was full of dangerous, volatile people did not square with what I saw first hand. As such, the disproportionately large police presence constantly surrounding the park seemed almost comical if one didn’t pause to consider the intent and effect of this enforcement policy: to intimidate others from participating.,The first time I , felt unsafe in Liberty Plaza was the ,, with the police in full riot gear and pepper spraying the crowd, seemingly at random. When you are dealing with cops in this situation, there is no reasoning with them and no predicting when they will decide to single you out, the only thing you can do is stay as far away as possible. That night, and other , of police , and ,, have successfully exposed the , nature of our police force.,One of the most forceful advocates against these practices to emerge from the OWS movement has been Captain Ray Lewis of the Philadelphia PD (retired). He has been present at OWS events since at least November 17th when , as part of a day of direct action. Lewis now speaks regularly to local occupations and other OWS affinity groups about the troubling trends in police enforcement that he has seen as both cop and protestor.,OWS has also helped bring much needed attention to the recent passage of the ,, as well as lesser-known, but equally abhorrent local law enforcement policies such as “,“. From the , to the , at Goldman Sachs, The , , of those who were , helped show what happens beyond the protecting eye of citizen controlled media. Speaking of controlling the media…,
Source: ,Within my first hour of stepping foot in Liberty Plaza, I was approached by a reporter  who asked me why I had come. I went on for about 10 minutes talking through and working out what has now been refined into my standard spiel of concerns. Then he moved on to talk to another person. Everywhere I looked, there were other camera crews talking to other ordinary people, people who weren’t getting that kind of amplification in August.,For far too long, there have been too many ,, ,, and , , who have dominated the political conversation in print and on television. They don’t see a , with ,, they don’t understand the ,, and they don’t know the first thing about truly holding power accountable.,At just about any major OWS event you can expect to talk to the media. I’ve now got my reasons for supporting this movement boiled down to a handful of concrete talking points.,Write up your own bullet points, things that go unsaid on any major network, and make them heard! More importantly, listen to the concerns being voiced around you. Show up at an upcoming , Popup Occupation, and you’ll have plenty of opportunities to do both.,I have no idea what I’m doing. All I’ve done is keep in touch with people I’ve met at Zuccotti and working group meetups. More and more as I started to take advantage of the networks OWS has established and the momentum of the initial Occupations, there seems to be no limit to the possibilities. That rosy optimism comes from meeting so many other folks who are equally “green”, and equally driven to see this movement succeed. I would say that about 50-75% of the people I’ve met and worked with so far in this movement are similar to me in that they have almost no prior experience in non-partisan activism. Some have very little experience in public protest at all. The common thread that binds us isn’t support for a leader, a political party, or even an ideology, but discovering and implementing ,.,Zuccotti Park in it’s brief time was an amazing ,, with working groups demonstrating innovations in water recycling and energy usage, hosting teach-ins and skill-shares, and others taking up the cause by ,. By simply creating a space where so many people could come and talk about what was wrong with the country, they sparked a change in our culture that will reverberate for a generation. In my own social circle alone, I know of dozens of people who are now , in and , about politics than they were prior to the Occupation.,The beauty of Occupy is that more and more people are recognizing that if you want to help the movement and keep it centered and honest, you can step up and be an organizer, a facilitator, a broadcaster, a tweeter, or a donor (of time, money or ,). Even if it should all fade and fizzle, no one who is passionately working to support OWS will suddenly stop to caring and become inactive should those three letters cease to have cultural relevance. Too many of us have found our voice will not return silent acquiescence of the status quo. By the end of spring, we should be able to walk without teetering too badly, and who knows, maybe by fall we’ll be ready to ,.,
Source: ,Winners and losers, that’s what the world of politics is based upon today. One year, you’re the dominant party, the next you’re in decline. What I have discovered through the OWS movement is the process of achieving consensus, which can be a far more satisfying form of democracy. This process comes with its own ,, but so does voting. The current two-party system has severely narrowed the range of acceptable debate, and local government isn’t the proper forum to address the fundamental institutional changes that need to take place in American society. The OWS General Assembly provides us with a different path.,My early experience with the GA in Zuccotti was a mixed bag. I would pop in and out of a few of the outdoor public GAs to help out on people’s mic, throw up my happy hands when I liked what I heard, and then pop out. I simply couldn’t attend enough to feel invested in the process. When I later tried to participate in the “Spokes Council” meeting, as a representative for Parents for Occupy Wall St., the process was continually derailed by disruptive people (who have since lost all credibility within the movement). I eased my worry about these problems by reminding myself that as a culture, we really don’t have a lot of experience in civic participation. To anthropomorphize this movement, back then we were just a baby learning how to rollover. Right about now, we’re actually learning how to crawl and move forward deliberately.,The folks who meet regularly at the , are definitely moving forward. I’ve been most excited about this new channel to support OWS, because it has proven to be the most dedicated and spirited. No one has been afraid to voice their concerns about any topic, and everyone attending so far is capable of dissenting , derailing the process or the conversation. We’ve had enlightening existential discussions about the feasibility of a ,, and are all dedicated to making sure that everyone who attends feels empowered and encouraged to participate fully.,As we move closer to deciding what types of direct actions we want to execute, we are looking into some exciting tools for collaboration. Besides the reliable standards like an ,, ,, and , , outlets, our attendees made us aware of tools such as ,, a conference call networking service, and a new and very promising tool available at , called ,. It will allow us to stay task-oriented as well as track each person’s contribution to a project’s success:,If you live in Bushwick and would like to come out and find more ways to help us continue to succeed, join us every Thursday at 7pm in March at ,. Here’s a list of our online touchpoints:,If you don’t live in Bushwick, ,.,If you don’t find one, start a general assembly in your neighborhood. As the sign says, “This is just starting.”, , ,This week’s mix takes me back to going record shopping for gigs, looking for new tracks to weave into an upcoming event.  Now, most record stores have closed, and buying music is done right from your laptop.  I used to drive into Manhattan on Friday nights, Sunday afternoons, and any other time there was quality house music being spun at clubs that had the right vibe (most we frequented didn’t even serve alcohol, because NOBODY there was drinking).  We’d make calls, get flyers, wait on lines, get pulled over and searched by undercover cops, make it through metal detectors and bouncers, all to finally be in the presence of the forbidden sounds of house music (“alternative life-style clubs”, as I remember one cop called them).,Entering clubs and raves back then to me was like discovering some underground love ritual.  My favorite DJs would drop tracks that blew my mind months and months before you’d ever see the record show up in a shop.  The sounds were meticulously selected and spun with long overlapping times between both records.  The suspense of feeling the beat push up, back, high, to way down… the DJ yielding his own rhythm and dynamics from behind the decks.  At first, I never even knew they were using records!  I’d see DJs bouncing, moving, pushing buttons, twisting knobs, bending down and shooting back up, like a control-station above the crowd equipped with the sounds we heard.  I remember being amazed by the concept that there were two songs playing and it wasn’t the DJ adding or subtracting sounds, it was the improvisational magic factor of beat-matching two records live and EQing and filtering to make it all dance seamlessly.,Here are some tracks I just bought this week in preparing for , this Saturday, March 10th- I’ll be spinning from 6-10pm at ,!,We will tell you right from the start: ,! Big things are being prepared in our beloved home sweet Bushwick. There will be so much art, you might easily overdose on it.

During , on Saturday almost every gallery in the borough will stay open late. In Bushwick, 15 galleries and art spaces will be participating in the biannual late night gallery walk, ,! This is the 7th Beat Nite in the history of Bushwick, and as 7 is a lucky number, this week’s Beat Nite is bound to be absolutely rad. We advise you to take friends, and maybe ride a bike, because you don’t want to miss awesome art spaces in Ridgwood. So join the crowds walking the streets of Bushwick and enjoy the overload of art!, ,In case you were getting overwhelmed, let us tell you what is what, and what to expect where!!, ,We are excited to see so many brand new galleries on the Beat Nite’s line up!

On Saturday go check out Martin Bromirski, Rachel LaBine, and Elizabeth Riley, and don’t miss the new sign created for Storefront by Skewville.,Have you been to Botanic yet? This space on Wycoff Ave had opened a couple of months ago, and its size and type reminds us a little bit of Storefront Bushwick. ,, the show the space is opening on Saturday, looks really awesome. Sarah Butler will be marking the glass window of the gallery, and transcribing text from the local graffiti and intertwining it with notional annotations from her personal experience. Another artist in the show Julie Trembley, has transformed the gallery into an artificial green space that is saturated with vibrant grass, bright sun, and an unlikely perch from which viewers are encouraged to take it all in….,Factory Fresh, Bushwick’s street art gallery is always fun to go to. On Saturday, you can check out the birthday show of the twin brothers duo, Skewville. Moreover, Bushwick Daily’s , will be DJing there – and those who know Jojo also know that you will dance like a crazy animal, and potentially have the best time of your life while at it.,English Kills should be your last stop, because that’s where the official after party is! Also take a look at the , that is being exhibited, and features some of the coolest artists ever shown at English Kills like Tescia Seufferlein and Don Pablo Pedro.,Certainly NOT a traditional gallery setting. When entering  , in DUMBO, you’ll encounter a pair of ,in the lounge area with a pot leaf on them strewn above your head.  Penises, breasts and vaginas are everywhere! And I mean everywhere. This is actually very appropriate however, because in the same exposed manner, Alex Emmart, the director of the space, left nothing of his thoughts of the art world to the imagination. And I mean nothing.,The striking not-so-private parts are part of the current show at the Gallery called ,, and are created by artist,. Also featured in the show is the artist ,, who also follows suite in bearing the bones of her artwork.  Even though the pieces are striking and provide an electric and exciting energy in the space, plopping down on the soft leather couch in the middle of the gallery is actually encouraged. Alex emanates this exuberant combination of cool and joy that obviously translates into the work shown in the space. He believes that an art space should be fist and foremost an inviting place to connect with art and each other. “My art, I feel is the art of interpretation,” he said. “It’s the ability to display artwork in a way that engages the trifecta. The pieces communicate, the person viewing the art communicates with the work, and the people in the space communicate with each other.”,This appeared to work wonderfully as we sat comfortably and discussed the mission of his gallery and the trends in his collections. Even though the gallery is in DUMBO, Alex is Bushwick resident who is totally inspired by his neighborhood. “Bushwick is the largest pool of artists you can find of completely random cool stuff, so a large percent of artists I work with live in Bushwick, have studios in Bushwick or ties to Bushwick in one way or another. So that’s really been one of my biggest influences with finding artists.”,The Mighty Tanaka Gallery, named after a badass little league baseball player, will have a booth this weekend at ,. Be sure to stop by to check out the work that is made by “us” for “us.” Alex spoke about the fact that many galleries are showing outrageous and expensive pieces to sell to high end collectors; something he feels sometimes hinders the experience of the viewer. “What’s most important is that it’s the voice of our generation, and that we are displaying ourselves as individuals who are working with a wide spectrum of art,” Alex said. “I want to switch it up and be fresh I want to ride the crest of what’s happening of the now.”,We went on to discuss the very relatable and approachable pieces he had in his gallery. “I really try hard to kind of remove that glass wall that separates the average person for the gallery experience. There’s been this elitism that goes along with fine art. We’re young people and we’re into cool shit, and just because it doesn’t look like I’m going to be buying art doesn’t mean I don’t want to have this experience.”,There is no doubt that when he sets up his booth at The Fountain Art Fair this weekend, there will be a lot of “completely random cool stuff” that is relatable, fresh and exciting to see. I half expect to see a couch in there as well., , ,Before you cringe about thinking about your naked nanna, let’s start off by saying this is not the kind of Gilf you are probably thinking of. “It’s kind of like my secret word for me,” the street artists began to explain as she meticulously cuts and measured a stencil.  “I know what it means, but everyone else thinks it means something different. It’s light hearted, where my work can be really heavy.” , of course isn’t her birth name, but the name she uses as she uses the street as her canvas to spread awareness about social, political and environmental issues.,If you entered Gilf’s studio and living space without prior knowledge of her line of work, you may mistake her for someone on the White House’s most wanted list, and she’d probably take that as a compliment. Aggressive red signs that read “Stop Corporate Douchebags” stand not too far from an almost ready stencil of Lady Liberty drinking the cool aid, literally, and multiple stencils that read “censorship” over and over.  A ridiculous and vomit worthy speech given by Rush Limbaugh plays in the background, no doubt to motivate her to continue making visually stunning pieces that stop and make the viewer think, as they give a voice to the underdog. ,I started doing street art to talk about stuff that people didn’t wanted to talk about,I feel that people feel hopeless about a lot of stuff and they don’t know how to deal with big issues that are facing us globally and culturally.  If I can talk to them in a visual sense, maybe I can change their perspective over time.”,There is something so technically beautiful in Gilf’s rebellious work.   As a self-proclaimed tomboy, Gilf expressed that her childhood dream was to design cars. She went on to study engineering in college to make this dream a reality. After learning this was far less than a creative field, and fearing a long career of designing tail lights for a living, Gilf decided she wanted to enter a new path in life involving a more artistic approach that would inspire and help others. As a result, her work has almost a mathematical approach to perfection. She meticulously cuts tiny dots, fills almost invisible cracks, and spray paints letters so perfectly that these pieces often get confused with screen prints.  All of this hard work is made with the knowledge of the ephemerality of the street as canvas, and it doesn’t matter to her as long as her points get across. ,It’s about engaging everyday people on the street and opening a dialogue about important issues. I put it out there and hope it reaches people, I hope they go home and Google it and talk about it with their friends.”,Her latest projects will be shown at the upcoming,. One series portrays a play on vision charts that spell out things like “stop looking the wrong way” and “vision is impossible when your eyes are closed.” Other powerful pieces such as a stencil of a birth control wheel with the words “why are men making these decisions for us?” put in place of the days of the week, prove that her pieces aren’t just beautiful, but a call to action.,Another one of Gilf’s undertakings involves a gardening initiative to promote hunger awareness. A wooden structure resembling a tree is mounted to her studio wall, brushing the ceiling. Spaces where “branches” should go will be filled with blue pouches made from 100% recycled plastic. The pouches will contain soil and the seeds of an edible plant. Gilf dreams of building these structures on the sides of buildings in underprivileged neighborhoods in New York, as well as in countries struggling with hunger across the globe. ,The idea is to bring it to different places around the world that have been hit with war or natural disaster. I’d like to do this project with a community that’s been through the worst, to bring a collaborative spirit back to their world.”,Her name speaks volume’s to her work, even if we don’t know what it actually means. Our first reaction is to assume it is closely associated with the acronym, Milf. But like the messages in her work, things aren’t always what they seem, and we should never take what someone tells us, or doesn’t tell us for face value. Always challenge things you feel are unfair, and use whatever talents you have to make your voice heard and to open a dialogue. That’s what this Gilf taught me anyway., ,This week’s mixtape is focused on Emotional Depth.  These 20 tracks are personal favorites that I’ve assembled to share a more intimate scope of my own tastes beyond the dancefloor.  I have cried, reflected, sang along, and sat alone to these tracks, and their impact grows as time goes on.  Some I have heard for years, though didn’t take an interest in until I really discovered their true beauty.,As music is interpreted by the listener, I’ve found myself relating to these emotions and have empathized with their words and sounds beyond their popularity or their assumed audience.  For example, the first track is a song I’ve known for a long time, but only in the past few years did I hear it differently.  It made so much sense to me once I took its message and applied it to myself as the narrative, although the singer in this case is a woman.  That is the essence of my intention here.  I hope to push these songs across our comfortable understandings and into the areas we may keep more guarded, more intimate.  To have a song possess the listener’s deepest emotions transcends any self-identification and provides a glimpse of our souls that doesn’t care whether we are men or women, gay or straight, old or young, etc.  And in seeking these lessons that are hidden in the areas of our minds that we guard and limit due to feelings of inhibition, we open ourselves up to true freedom and emotions that were never supposed to be hidden.,The mixtape contains:,We want to send some love and appreciation to all the Bushwick ladies in art. We chose 10 young female artists who either live, work in Bushwick or are an inseparable part of the Bushwick art scene. We find their art (and them as well) completely mind-blowing.  Also we would love to see their solo show in one of the Bushwick galleries (yes, it’s a total hint).  Big thank you for all the tips we received on , and ,. If you think that we completely omitted someone extremely amazing, drop us a comment! We are always curious about new amazing atrists.,… and here are the ladies and their art in alphabetical order:, ,[box]Liz Atzberger works in all kinds of media, from painting to 3D objects and sculpture. She uses innovative materials and bright colors that won’t keep you neutral. Furthermore, she has a great personality and a ton of energy.  She is one of the co-founders of , in Bushwick, and feels positive about collaboration.[/box], ,[box]Andrea Bergart has a great eye for color and pattern, which makes her not only a brilliant artist but also a ,. She finds her inspiration in the visual language of the 1990s and in African bead making. Andrea has spend a whole deal of time in Ghana, and we just love her , and ,.[/box], ,[box]Gilf! is a street artist whose aim is to challenge everything! She fights inequality and is not afraid to address political issues in her street art as well as fine art work. Gilf! is one of the few street art chicks, and we dig her big time![/box], ,[box]Rebecca Goyette is a provocative, fresh artist with a great sense of humor. You will have so much fun enjoying her work! She works across the media, from painting to performance art and film. She has created her alter ego, Lobster Lady, and is basically about ,. Don’t loose the sight of her, and we promise an awesome art adventure![/box],[box]Erin Haldrup is a sweet, fresh voice in painting! Energetic palette and imagery balancing somewhere between abstract and figurative. We love it![/box], ,[box]Ellen Letcher is one of the most distinctive voices in the neighborhood. Ellen’s collages are cutting edge and throat, disturbing, charming, beautiful, ugly, energetic and calm – all of that at the same time. Ellen is also one of the co-creators of ,, an influential gallery in Ridgewood. In other words, Ellen is absolutely brilliant!![/box], ,[box]Rebecca Litt creates unsettling environments in her paintings. A recurring motive in her work is on orange plastic barricade fence. The characters in her paintings are surrounded with it to protect themselves from the world realizing that the protection is more of a feeling than an effective fencing.   We believe that this orange fence is something we can all relate to. Rebecca rocks![/box], ,[box]Have you been wondering who hang those sparkly shoes on wires in Bushwick as a response to typical Brooklyn hanging sneakers? It was ,! This girl works with costumes on Broadway, and creates great photo installations among other things. Watch out for her![/box],[box]A hit by the energy of Julie Torres! That’s how it feels like when looking at a grid of abstract paintings of this remarkable artist.  Julie has been not only creating, but also curating and organizing some of the most extraordinary art events in Bushwick. From , to a 72-hour long art marathon using ,.[/box],[box]Ashley Zelinskie is a new media and conceptual artist. She is , when it comes down it. Ashley basically talks in HTML, and is fascinated by new technology and computer perception of art. Ashley is one of our favorite girls in Bushwick art also because she proves that everything is possible with the right attitude. Besides great conceptual art, in the age of 24, she runs an artist studio building and a gallery, ,. Respect![/box],New venues are popping up all over Bushwick with the influx of people the quickly-flourishing art and music scene. These new hot spots fall (for the most part) into two predictable catagories: fleeting-but-trendy DIY spots and highly-anticipated big, sleek, well-funded spots. There are the legendary DIY venues that live in creaky, old dingy apartment/mansions like the ever-ellusive , (scheduled to re-open one of these days…) and ,. Then there are new refurbished spaces that hook a DIY approach onto their belt-clip when hosting shows, from Chinese Buffets (,) and Storage Units (,) to Party Stores (,), but have yet to make a name for themselves with multiple hit shows or permits that allow them to operate on a regular scedule.,It’s a unique market to be opening a new venue into, and the rumors about sleek, new additions are flying. , is an example of one of the talked-about, fancy new spots whose music scene was promising (especially when , moved their summertime concerts to their ‘Rock Yard’) but ended up falling on its face. I mean, really, when was the last good show at The Morgan? We’ve all heard about ,, an , that is still a mystery in the works but is said to have an indoor capacity of over 700. They haven’t spilled the booker(s) they will employ but you can be assured this is going to host big name shows. Then there will be a beautiful warehouse space called , on Grand and Morgan where booking will be done by hard-working and promotional guru David Teller of , (stay tuned for exclusive details on this spot!).,But, these fancy newer additions and dinky one-hit-wonder DIY spaces are not all this article is about! We’re here to list the 5 most classic tried-and-true Bushwick Venues- some of them still new, some with a new facelift, others the same gaudy storefronts since the day they opened. One thing all concert-goers can agree on (despite what they might have to say about Bushick’s newer venue options)- they feature great music, and that’s what a venue is all about.,5.,- 90 Manhattan Ave.,Don Pedro, the “Casa of Rock” tends to be overlooked because it is primarily a restaurant that converts one of its (very large!) rooms into a venue for concerts on occasion. But, those occasions are good ones for music of all genres! They host feel good music on a spacious elevated stage that could easily start hosting big names again (they once hosted Vivian Girls!) once they get their act together. Performing here is a joy for musicians with the great PA system and stage. Plus the shows here are always affordable or free, so you can spend those extra bucks on savory Mexican food.,4. , - 1087 Broadway,This intimate coffee-shop-by-day takes on a whole different ambience by night. You’ll always recognize a photo taken inside this space because of the intricate and colorful stage set up or the cluttered outdoor performance space, which is jammed with vintage toys and other weird memorabilia. GBM is the kind of place where you’ll see your friend’s band play an enjoyable and memorable set to a quaint and attentive crowd. Classic.,3. ,- 78 Varet St,Ok, yes, this is very much a new DIY space, but it’s made a name for itself as one of the best venues to open in Bushwick, EVER. With almost nightly shows, really impressive line-ups, and a unqiue art interior, Big Snow has filled a gap in the Brooklyn music scene. That gap overfloweth with Big Snow’s good qualities- affordable, unpretentious, laid back, friendly, and on top of that a fantastic sound system.,2. ,- 119 Ingraham St","

Regina Rex is a great gallery at 1717 Troutman that never disappoints, so head there this Friday for a regular dose of art this week., , ,[quote]It’s good for people to be scandalized; it’s good for people to see all kinds of art and everybody should be able to show it. [/quote], Those are probably the first three things you will notice when meeting Elizabeth Tully. Elizabeth who is one of the two , producers, lives in a loft across the street from Roberta’s. We took a walk on a crazy windy day around the factories of Morgantown, and talked a lot about Foutain and Elizabeth’s involvement with it. Elizabeth started as an intern at  at , whose owners also happen to organize Foutain Art Fair, and it all went from there., ,It’s in the air, and don’t tell us it’s not March 20 yet!  The spring is (almost) here, and it can be said with 100% certainty that it will be hitting Bushwick at any moment!  Bushwick is a great place to be once the weather gets warmer. It’s true that you might not notice that the trees are getting greener, mainly because there aren’t too many, but yet there are at least 10 awesome things one can do in our beloved Pigeon town…., ,Yeah, there might still be cobwebs and fake graves from Halloween; overturned buckets and disintegrating cardboard, moutains of dog poop, huge masses of leaves and probably a few beer cans, too. Soon you will be able to face the challenge of making it usable again, and THEN getting to enjoy the space., ,If you need an excuse to go out and enjoy the spring weather, take a walk in Bushwick and take photos of the best street art pieces you encounter., ,Throw a rooftop party! Don’t listen to people who tell you it’s a bit too soon.

You’ll have a , salad in no time!, ,Going for coffee or a drink? Deliberately choose a place with a courtyard. There isn’t that many of them in Bushwick, but trust us Kave at The Loom – totally worth it! Nothing beats drinking some of , from Kave, and chilling in their really clean, spacious, and social sprawling outdoor space. For colorful cocktail at a Bushwick back yard, check out ,!, ,This is not a joke! Mr. Softee is back. We recognized the mildly creepy tune yesterday between the noises of sirens, ran down to the street, only to see a happy crowd of kids following a Mr. Softee’s truck.

Maybe try get some pocket money through busking. Take your guitar or flout, and get to work…, ,You don’t have to have your tacos sardine-style inside of the famous garage. You can now freely tear due to excessive amounts of salsa verde on your tacos, while standing on fresh air in front of your favorite taqueria; observe people coming in and out the Jefferson stop, and think how beautiful your life in Bushwick is….,A Bushwick apartment search done on Craigslist is the true test of patience. By our seat-of-the-pants calculations, the volume of misleading posts and spam have climbed upwards faster than the , that are springing up all over this neighborhood.,“Some call it Bushwick, some call it East Williamsburg—we’ll call it whatever you want,” said Rachel, a real estate broker, in a pleasant voice when we inquired about a rental property on Irving Avenue and Jefferson Street.,Rachel’s job is to fill vacancies as quickly as possible and to appeal to whatever sensibilities a perspective tenant may have when he or she conducts a search. She won’t try to convince you that , is not in Bushwick or that East Williamsburg does not exist. But among those of us who are not in the real estate business, there are certainly enough people who do argue these and subsequent opposing viewpoints.,Before the eye-rolling and deep guttural groaning begins, we would like to pose a simple two-part question: Does this matter and why?,The flippant answer would be that it doesn’t.,But we believe that, to some extent, it does and we were willing to put in the legwork to figure this out once and for all.,Our first step was to define the word “neighborhood”. , to do so falls in line with the ,—that the concept of a neighborhood is subjective.,To make things more difficult, a representative from the NYC Department of City Planning told us that there are no official neighborhood boundaries. Instead, the city recognizes the , that were created in 1975, before which the five boroughs were divided into ,. Predating even that Bushwick was the much larger ,, which also included Williamsburg and Greenpoint.,Today’s Bushwick lies within the borders of Brooklyn Community District 4. It is defined by Flushing Avenue, Broadway, the Queens border and the Evergreen Cemetery. These lines are clearly documented on ,. So it seems that “community district” is just administrativese for “neighborhood”. Case closed?,It’s not entirely so simple. Community District 1, for example, is made up of five distinct neighborhoods—Park Slope, Carroll Gardens, Red Hook, Gowanus and Cobble Hill.,However, if we look to Google Maps, which uses APIs like , to overlay neighborhood borders, we’ll see that Bushwick’s boundaries are identical to the city’s community district lines.,Similarly, vintage map reseller , has maps that show the neighborhood, then referred to as Ward 11, as bound by Flushing Avenue to the north, Broadway to the west and “Cemetery of the Evergreens” to the south, with only the Queens/Newton border in dispute.,With all this in mind, we have to remember that a neighborhood is not only defined by the arbitrary lines drawn by people that died long before any of us were born. A neighborhood also embodies a sense of community, culture and familiarity. Your neighborhood is the local store you can always count on, the crack in the sidewalk you usually remember to avoid and the familiar faces on stoops and at Laundromats.,In Bushwick specifically there are the blocks—or steps, for the luckier of us—to the L and M trains; the open fire hydrants in the summer; and the innumerable bodegas, galleries, Botanicas, record stores, eateries and bars.,What Bushwick is all depends on who is asked. Whether it is described as ,, a , or ,, the answer will be based on personal biases and interests. And it seems that its geographic location is not free from these filters either.,We asked Eli, another broker, why the rental property he was advertising was listed under East Williamsburg/Bushwick when it was four blocks south of Broadway. His answer was a dull beep followed by a dropped call., ,During my entire Brooklyn career, I’ve lived exclusively, in tiny apartments. ’Humble,’ I like to call them. Through the trials and tribulations of hiding things in boxes under my bed, feeling locked in a cage, and knocking things over, I discovered 5 easy tips to maximizing the small space I call mine.,Walls are good for more than just shelves. I like to hang functional things that could also serve as good decoration. In my last apartment my bedroom had no closet, so I nailed a bunch of hooks into the wall and hung my most decorative dresses. This kept my otherwise white-room warm, and allowed me to get a good grip on what I wanted to wear each day. This idea could be awesome with anything you have excess of.,There is no sense in getting a regular fixture if you can get something that also stores stuff or doubles as something else. Something like these ottomans can be used as a cushioned stool and for storage too. They’re kind of pricey at Target, but you can usually find them for under $20 at a furniture store in Brooklyn or Queens.,Modern looks are great for apartments; they feel open and airy. Unfortunately, if you have a small, aged place like many Brooklyners, this look is difficult to achieve as old places get dirty very easily. White can also feel intuitional if your windows don’t offer much light and you have small rooms. Many designers suggest light colors to make your room look bigger. I did this with my bathroom, but I also found other ways to keep the room feeling light, but warm and lived in. , Unfortunately, there’s no way around it- when your place is small, you can’t always fit in everything you want. You should think about what your needs are and make the right sacrifices. Sacrifices also save in your wallet. An example is, our living room is tiny, so I sacrificed a coffee-table and picked up a small nightstand. I can still use its surface and drawer space for additional storage., It is inventible. A small spot is going to have stacks of stuff somewhere. The best thing to do, to avoid a pack-rat look, is to be conscious of where this happens. Places up high, or behind curtains where gunk is kept out of site are prime locations. For instance: In the bathroom we leave no gunk on the kitchen sink (face-wash, razors) but instead on the windowsill which is hidden behind the shower curtain., ,The headline says it all! Outkast’s funkmaster , recently teamed up with ,, the brain behind ,, and , for a new Converse collaboration project called ,.,Converse occasionally puts together incredible (and incredibly different) artists to release 1-song-collaboration- past team-ups included Julian Casablancas of the Strokes, Santogold, and Pharrell on guitar-driven fuck-pop-dance jam “My Drive Thru”. The radio edit of  ”DoYaThing” (available for free download at , and streaming below!) dropped TODAY, clocks in at 4 and a half minutes, and is a spicy cocktail of jitery psychadelic disco fuck juice- it’s really an incredible listen. There was also a 12+ minute editor’s cut release, available at the ,.,During Andre 3000′s lightning-spit verse I was surprised and ecstatic to hear Andre 3000 shout out Bushwick! The exact lyrics go like this: ,.,Now, I’m no lyrical interpreter, but it appears that he’s placing Bushwick on a pedastal, a level of greatness to be achieved, along the same lines of noteriety as Scarface and Willie D. Awesome. Thanks Andre 3000, we love you too! Edit: Ok, so it’s brought to our attention that , Andre 3000 was referring to Bushwick Bill, another member of Geto Boys. But, hell, we’ll still take it as a compliment.,If you’re interested in learning more about the collaboration, , to read an interview James Murphy and Damon Albarn of Gorillaz.

Seven awesome art fairs will present their art shows to the public following the historic tradition of , that was held for the first time in 1913 as , at the 69th Regiment Armory on Lexington Avenue between 25th and 26th Streets.,Among the seven art fairs, , is arguably the , and the most open to emerging artists and galleries. Naturally, this means that Fountain is a popular destination for exhibitors and their friends from Bushwick, and by now it’s a good tradition of many awesome Bushwickians not to miss Fountain. From the exhibitors this year, we are totally looking forward to see ,, who will present the most viral of all the current performers – ,. , gallery, whose owners are from Bushwick represents many Bushwick-based street artists, and our favorite chick in street art Gilf! will be at Foutain too. Amazing performers from , will be there too, and let’s not forget about our artsy sister project, the 1st Bushwick internet-based gallery, ,, objective of which is to endorse Bushwick art using the power of the Internet.,This year’s Foutain is taking place in the historic 69th Regiment Armory, and we went to check out the location and to meet up with the Fountain organizational team. I’m sure you’d be excited to hear that many of the people on the team are also from Bushwick, like the producer – Elisabeth Tully.,Fountain Art Fair is having a , tonight at Gallery Bar in the city, and with a discounted ticket you can drink as much free beer as you want to and listen to all the awesome DJs.  So don’t miss out if you’re in the city tonight.,Are you from Bushwick and are you part of the Armory Week? Leave us a comment, we’d be happy to check you out!,This week’s mixtape is inspired by ,‘s recent offline opening, ,.  When I was asked to put together 90′s music for the evening, I was truly ecstatic!  As any DJ finds, so much effort is spent gigging and spinning music for the crowd’s tastes, yet perhaps not always so favorable to one’s own palette.  Thankfully, I happen to reside in the neighborhood that says, “Guilty pleasures?  Why guilty?”…,…and then dances their asses off, sings along, and shakes the dirt out of the ceiling!,Thanks to all the folks who made that night so memorable, and for removing the guilt from the pleasure!,I LOVE THIS STUFF and really enjoyed mixing it for you.  I hope you enjoy it!,Please leave feedback and let us know what you think.  I’m going to be spinning a different mix each week, different genres, moods, themes, and your comments are greatly appreciated.,What makes us REALLY obsessed with Bushwick, are the only-in-Bushwick type of events. It seems that this weekend is full of them, and leaving the neighborhood seems like a big no no! Here are our favorite five of them:,You know that spot on Wycoff Ave, right by the Jefferson L stop that says ,? That’s a new awesome music venue! They are opening this Friday with , (DIVE, Total Slacker, Night Manager, Woodsman, Fabric). We know!

I’ll be , and/or livestreaming for anyone who can’t attend.,This week’s reading discussion will be based on the essay , by Jo Freeman, and will be led by one of our regular attendees. The discussion will focus on the “Formal and Informal Structures” and “Political Impotence” sections of the text. If you don’t have time to read the essay in its entirety, you can skim through those passages.,I’m excited to hear the group’s take on this topic, as it is one we shall have to deal with as we grow and begin to plan any direct actions. We do not have a formal process for deciding on issues, or a mandate that people participate beyond showing up to General Assemblies. The goal is to have people step up and share the responsibility of maintaining an ongoing local presence for the Occupy movement, but also to make the Occupy movement aware of our local issues and concerns. As we move towards that goal, the dream of a “leaderless” or totally “horizontal” movement has to give way to the reality of getting things done. As the primary “digital facilitator” for Occupy Bushwick, I have become a gatekeeper for what gets broadcast to the group and the outside world via the , Twitter feed in addition to what I post here and on ,. Recognizing this, I have made every effort to collect feedback from the other GA attendees on any decisions I make regarding setting meeting times, distributing flyers, or anything else that did not go thru an official consensus process.,This reading should elicit some good conversations about how we can grant people the authority to be helpful and accomplish tasks, while still having a formal structure in place to make sure that the group continually approves of how that authority has been used. It’s essentially taking on the root cause of frustration with our current government: responsiveness and accountability.","

"“Brooklyn is so brown when compared to Manhattan,” says Andrea Bergart when leaning on the fence at a pier. Manhattan looks like a toy city; you could just reach and touch the plastic buildings. Brooklyn, on the other hand, looks like its humble brother. The wind is fierce; our hair is flying around; the seagulls shriek as they are flying around. There are strange places in New York, and the , is certainly one of them., ,
,Imagine taking a tour of an art gallery through someone’s mind, where each and every fold of the brain is another corridor leading you to a brilliant piece someone had once seen or thought of.  ,, a group show curated by Jason Andrew is currently on view at , in Chelsea feels exactly as a physical tour through an art gallery of the mind., is a show that features over 40 artists from the tight nit and burgeoning art scene in Bushwick that the curator and collector himself is very much a part of.  The opening night was packed with a sort of who’s who of the Bushwick art scene, those one would normally see hanging around , or ,. It was as if a space ship had sucked them all up and dropped them off in Chelsea.  Some , that this was the slightly less than unintentional plan of Jason Andrew himself, to swipe the artists from their homey-digs as Chelsea big-wig , opened their new space in Bushwick on that very night.,There is less than a visual theme that ties the show together.  Paintings seemed to work with drawings, drawings with sculpture, sculpture with collage. But despite a theme not being visibly apparent, it was clear that these pieces were tied together by community. In a statement in the gallery, Andrew ponders the fact that we live in a very uncertain era, and all we can really rely on is our creative wits. So whether it was Paul D’Agostino’s collage of clock cut outs ticking along near Brooke Moyse’s abstract painting “Kalied,” or Ben Godward’s giant blob of paint that looks like it had once wreaked havoc on a street, swallowing bottles and license plates in its colorful path – these ideas juxtaposed against one another in one space created a solidness and a comfort.,What , know, or can take from the show, is these great works are being thought of and created, and don’t just exist in a Bushwick vacuum. The show is unapologetic in being simply a massive collection of great, solid pieces. And because of that, there was a different feeling in the air in Chelsea that evening. A shift, a change, a quake could be felt in the art world.,The remaining 500 openings in Bushwick last weekend had a common topic for discussion: ,We have , the potential impacts of having a fancy Chelsea gallery taking a slide on Bushwick DYI hippness , and ,, and then we discussed it once ,. It seems like all that remains is to acknowledge that they are here, and to hope that their presence will bring as many positive things as possible. Hopefully, they will acknowledge us back, make a studio visit here and there, and discover local emerging talent. Some of us were asking how does one even make them notice us? How does one network with art world celebrities? Well, we don’t know either. But here is what you definitely should not be doing:, Stare creepily at Marina Abramovič, because the fact she starred at you at , gives you enough of an excuse., When bumping into , in the bathroom, ask casually whether his barber takes hallucinogens., Give wrong directions to that middle-aged lady who is scared to death trying to navigate her GPS from Grattan to Knickerbocker crying she doesn’t even know where she is… Send her to Johnson Avenue for a l,., Demand a free can of Tecate from Luhring Augustine employee with British accent. Insist you need it to process the trippy installation!, , will surely reserve a spot for you among her Top 2012 if  you only perform that piece you’ve been practicing with your roommates in your loft. Yes, perform right there at the opening. Naturally, her friends are interested too., Ask that artsy middle aged French lady next to you at the opening to tell you stories about Henri Matisse when he was still alive., Just stand there. Be naked while at it., Wonder where all these old people came from and why they keep staring at all those numbers. Wonder aloud.,  The best way to get the attention of , is to steadily scream in a high pitched voice (we swear)., Stalk , home. For the future reference, you need to know where she lives., , ,Last weekend I bounced over to ,for a drink and happened upon , an electronic band from Brooklyn, who impressed me with their unapologetic performance. The dance-thrash duo featured loud, growling drums and female lead singer who pumped out beats between urgent strings of vocals. Falling somewhere near to the electro-noise vibes of , and embodying hints of the kooky, cultish performance quality of someone like ,, , is off to a great start in Brooklyn. They perform (exclusively) with visual effects guru ,, who stood out on his own for beautiful video installation that made the perfect backdrop for the night.,Compared to the intense, industrial sounds coming from the stage at Fireproof, their 3-song ep, ,, is a surprisingly mellow listen on ,. Smooth, surging rhythms pave the way for a nostalgic set of songs that feels more nostalgic than urgent. The sheer different between their wild, dark performance and these personal, thoughtful tracks leaves the trace of a question mark in my mind.  They not only mix genres that have found their way into the Brooklyn scene recently- lo-fi, noise, industrial, experimental- but also find a lot of soul in simple rock-based hooks and the addition of an array of instruments, from synth to viola .,Vernous plays next March 3rd at 316 Seigel’s Manifesta Loft. RSVP on ,.,Are you squinting night by night on your unfinished novel manuscript? Are you dreaming about holding a hard cover proudly bearing your name one day? Are you reading literary journals and hoping to see your name in the Table of Contents rather sooner than later? In other words, are you a Bushwick writer hoping to get published?,We asked five of the Bushwick writers who have been published for their advice…,Passionate. Speculative. Honest.,I started a publishing house called , and published my book ,, a steampunk fantasy novel about being different and learning to love yourself for who you are. It’s available on , and ,, and at small bookstores around New York City, including Bushwick’s , at the Loom.,No matter what you do in the writing world, patience is key. These things take time, especially when you’re at the point of trying to get your work out there. Don’t get discouraged. Also, don’t be afraid to pursue nontraditional means of publishing. The literary world is in an amazing, exciting state of change right now, so anything is possible. If you’re going to publish your own work, be ready for a long, tough, expensive journey. Avoid self-publishing sites like , or , and do your research so that you put out a book that people will take seriously. Most importantly, hire a professional editor and designer. In the end it comes down to quality writing, solid editing, and great design.

,Last Friday night in Bushwick the normally desolate strip of Knickerbocker Avenue at Johnson was transformed by the inaugural opening of ,. The well-regarded Chelsea gallery opened its long-awaited Bushwick annex with a major show by pioneering video artist Charles Atlas.  Throughout the three hour opening–normal for Bushwick but long by Chelsea standards–a small crowd milled around outside the well-lighted, elegantly transformed former warehouse space. Well-heeled guests arrived in Dial cars while local artists gave directions to first-time visitors clearly flummoxed by the unfamiliar geography of the neighborhood.,Inside was a scene of contrasts.  Many local artists were in attendance including William Powhida, Stephen Truax, Will Pappenheimer, Carol Salmanson, Letha Wilson, and Max Warsh of the gallery collective Regina Rex.  But unlike openings at galleries run by local artists, many attendees were not Bushwick regulars. Marina Abramovic, Kathy Halbreich, Jerry Saltz and Roberta Smith could be seen in the wall-to-wall crowd, along with other art-world luminaries.  For much of the evening, co-owner Roland Augustine took up a post front-and-center in the foyer to greet arrivals, a gesture disarmingly gracious for a Chelsea gallery owner. Nonetheless, the contrasts and juxtapositions of the familiar and the exotic left many wondering whether this represented the end of the Bushwick art world they knew, an exciting new chapter in the history of the local art community, or something in between.,The artwork on display, Charles Atlas’s video installation, ,, is a tour de force. Entering the gallery through a dark corridor, the viewer encounters three darkened rooms open to one another onto which the videos are projected. Black and white images of geometric patterns unfurl, and cascades of numbers unspool in rapid succession.  James Panero, Managing Editor and art critic of ,, remarked that the experience was akin to being in “The Matrix,” a world in which humankind has been atomized into avatars of code.  The audience became part of the installation as the projections played across bodies and faces, enveloping everyone in the artist’s digital cabinet of wonder.,Luhring Augustine’s building had been under construction for over a year, resulting in a transformation largely invisible from the outside. The building’s red brick is painted a sober grey. The gallery’s name appears modestly on one of the entrances to the building. Inside, however, the full extent of the resources brought to bear is immediately apparent.  The space is huge and beautifully finished, capped by a wooden, cantilevered ceiling. It is as if a Chelsea space had been recreated in Bushwick–not entirely unexpected, but arresting to those used to the neighborhood’s DIY ethos and aesthetic. Given the gallery’s location across from a working cement factory and next to a Won Ton warehouse, Charles Atlas’s flickering videos call to mind an end-of-the world scenario, a Bushwick ,or Twilight of the Gods.,One viewer called it “enchanting,” a response that seemed to capture the frisson of excitement and wonder surrounding the arrival of this new presence on the landscape of the Bushwick art world.,Bushwick’s new neighbors offered gracious words of welcome. Luhring Augustine’s director, Lauren Wittels concluded: “The attendance was great, with so many neighborhood artists.  The work is fantastic.  The vibe was all positive. We couldn’t be more pleased or proud.”, , (previously known as Curbs and Stoops) has some sweet news! After months of reconstruction, they have finally finished their gallery space. This really is a huge reason to be excited! When I say a huge reason, I mean exactly 1,500 square feet of a reason!! In other words, the Gallery at The Active Space could easily be the largest gallery in Bushwick…., ,These are the ambitious plans of Joshua Richholt with the ,off the Montrose L stop, which once was a brewery. , informs us that the former manager of , and , plans to open a giant music venue called , and a huge beer hall called The Well this fall. Both will be in the building at 260 Meserole.,Meserole Street is already home to rehearsal rooms for many bands. Let’s see how they will welcome the presence of a “music fortress,” The Wick. The Well, will be a 15,000 square foot beer hall, with an additional 11,000 square feet of outdoor garden. The Well also plans to offer home-brewing classes and its own farmer’s market in the backyard.,The plans sound amazing. Hopefully, The Wick and The Well won’t end up as unwelcoming as ,, which once had amazing plans to become the best bar/music venue for Bushwick. It is empty on most days, and usually only gets crowded for large events booked by Manhattan companies seeking to provide their employees with a “Bushwick adventure” party.,[mappress mapid=""47""],Did you wake up this morning in panic looking at all the art opening invitations wondering ,I personally did, but on the second thought I realized that there everything can be done with a proper planning. That’s why I prepared Weekend Art Map marking down the locations of all the Friday and Saturday art openings in Bushwick and Ridgewood. I hope that this Weekend Art Map will be  a valuable tool when trying to locate and see all the art.,Here is also a small description of art happenings in the area. Good luck!,I am really excited for what is prepared for early Friday night in Ridgewood. The exhibition at Valentine commemorates a film made over 70 years ago on Cornelia Street in Ridgewood. In 2002 artists Jude Tallichet and Matt Freedman bought a building at Cornelia Street and turned it into a studio and living space. While exploring their new property and neighborhood, they discovered the half-degraded film, which documents the efforts of Rabbi Jacob Weiss to build a golem, a supernatural being made of animated clay, to protect his congregation from their anti- Semitic neighbors in the early 1940s.,On Friday, the long awaited and discussed inaugural exhibition of Luhring Augustine is being held in Bushwick. The “gorilla” of the art world originally claimed to had bought only a storage space in Bushwick. However, even Luhring Augustine couldn’t resist the growing hype of Bushwick and its Knickerbocker location will serve as an exhibition space as well. On Friday night, they will present ,, a solo exhibition of the American film and video artist Charles Atlas. I personally want to see it…,It is qiute convenient that the galleries located in the building at 56 Bogart coordinate their openings. You can go once, and see three and more exhibitions at the same time. This is what’s going on there on Friday night;,The Parlour is a brand new gallery located at Bushwick Ave, and Group Show #1 is their very 1st exhibition. If you’re as curious as me, you’ll head there early, because Saturday will be really busy.,Microscope Gallery presents a series of events in connection with the 50th anniversary of Film-Makers’ Cooperative. On Saturday, a legendary filmmaker Ken Jacobs will present some of his early works; as well as and his recent anaglyph 3D video. The event is $6 (Ken Jacobs will be present at the screening).,One of our absolutely favorite new galleries in the area, Small Black Door, is having an opening of a hyper-colorful group show presenting some of the most hip artists in the area (Liz Atzberger, Joe Ballweg, Saira McLaren, Ziad Naccache, Douglas Einar Olsen, Jamie Powell and Eric Sall). A part of the night will belong to a collaborative performance by artists Lydia Ainsworth and Lara Gemmiti.,Legendary loft gallery of Paul D’Agostino will present another of its , exhibitions. Simposio means that artists not only show, but also give short talks about their art work.,You might be a little startled here. Fitness studio? Art show? Drawing? Music? And my answer is YES! Why? Because this is Bushwick…. Prepared by 950 Hart Gallery, I am positive the night will be fun! Expect a pop up art show from 950 Hart’s roster of artists, life drawing with exotic costumed models and live music. All until the sunrise, it seems , , ,The second General Assembly at The LOOM gallery had about 14-16 participants throughout the evening. Each week, a different member volunteers to lead a teach-in or skillshare on a topic they have studied. This week’s was led by , , and built upon , discussion of Gentrification. She brought in the book “Urban Fortunes” by John R. Logan and Harvey L. Molotch and we each took a turn reading a paragraph and then discussing what was read with the group. ,.,Following that discussion, I proposed that we go around the room and each talk about our individual reasons for supporting OWS, and what we hope our local group will become. As I’m on vacation most of this week, I don’t have time to recap the whole thing, but the livestream has been archived for review ,.,There is one takeaway from the discussion that I’d like to write about briefly, and it came from a friendly interchange between two very different occupiers. The woman who spoke after me in the circle said that she was concerned that OWS wasn’t aligning itself strongly enough on specific issues and wanted to see more tangible accomplishments. There was a lot of agreement in the room to that statement, including from myself. Later in the circle, we came to ,, a self-described longtime activist and anarchist, who addressed this concern directly by reminding all of us that 14-20 total strangers getting together on a regular basis in their community to talk about all the troubling issues facing our country , a tangible accomplishment in and of itself. I couldn’t agree more.,Granted, it’s going to take a lot more than just talking to bring about real change, but we’re still less than 6 months into this movement’s inception. There’s an awful lot of talking that still has to occur before we can hope to act in the interests of the 99%. Local, ongoing General Assemblies like Bushwick’s will be an essential element to any major actions aimed at reforming or reimagining our system.,The next Bushwick General Assembly will be at 7pm at ,. We will have another book-driven discussion, this time led by ,. We will be reading from the book “Direct Action: An Ethnography” by David Graeber. You can , if you’d like to come to the meeting primed to discuss and debate.","

"A regular day on Knickerbocker Avenue is a busy one. A number of shops with a different level of obscureness and usefulness provide for customers coming in and out, loud salsa music and different smells from nail polish to live fish to sweet bakery smell. Yesterday was a specifically busy one. Around 4pm people were rushing to spend time with their Valentines, dragging balloons, stuffed teddy bears and chocolate. Did you also get a present in Bushwick style?,How many coffee shops are there in Bushwick? Many! Just look at the , of our Guide. But which place is the best? What makes for the perfect caffein experience? Does atmosphere matter more than the coffee?,I chose seven popular cafes around Bushwick at random and visited each establishment— a different one every day—over the course of a single week. I would order a single espresso (no milk, no sugar—just the way I like it) and whatever else I wanted. And then I would record my experience. I rated each cafe in five categories (espresso taste, price, atmosphere, staff, and overall experience) on 1 to 5; 5 being amazing and 1 being Lana Del Rey terrible.,Keep in mind that these reviews are meant only as an introduction to the various cafes you may not be acquainted with. You are encouraged to try out each one for yourself to see which one is the right fit. Because any one of these cafes is so much better than a life without coffee…,And now chicks and dudes, I give you my reviews, in no particular order:,(941 Willoughby Ave between Myrtle Ave & Charles Pl),espresso ★★★★,
price ★★★★★,
atmosphere ★★★★,
staff ★★★★★,
overall ★★★★★,This place is everything you’d want in a neighborhood cafe. It keeps a revolving collection of art on the walls, has a laid back but lively feel, and has enough room to even hold a few music shows here and there. It’s an eclectic, colorful  space that usually has a good crowd. There’s a big window in the front, letting in a lot of sunlight and speakers near the back (playing The Knife when I was there). So you kind of have to choose between quiet and dark. This is not a loungy cave like some cafes but a place to bring your laptop and get work done or meet for a brainstorming session over lunch. I also love that they have self serve water, an under-appreciated luxury if you ask me. And I do enjoy their menu. It includes a variety of coffee and non-coffee drinks—Bushwick Egg Creams, Bomb Lattes (you’ll have to find out for yourself)—and a wonderful assortment of sammies. I got the Aladdin (tomato, spinach, and avocado with hummus on whole wheat), served up by a remarkably nice staff. And oh yeah, the espresso is excellent; simple with just the right amount of bite.,(1096 Broadway between Dodworth St & Dekalb Ave),espresso ★★,
price ★★★★,
atmosphere ★,
staff ★★,
overall ★★,When I walked into this place, it was completely empty. So needless to say the atmosphere was a bit dull. I wouldn’t expect any half decent cafe to be on this stretch of Broadway anyway (right across from Lone Wolf) so at least it’s trying. But boy does this one need some sprucing up. Tacky scenes of Paris on the walls, a book shelf filled with dull art books from the 90s, and a kitchen in the back room sectioned off by yellow caution tape? On the bright side, It’s definitely unpretentious and there’s no fear of being distracted here. As for the espresso, I may just be projecting here but I found it to be equally uninspired; a little gritty and a little too sharp. But I guess Anthom Cafe would be fine to grab a coffee and a respectable $3 egg and cheese on good bread in your rush to catch the J train. I’m just saying it doesn’t make me want to go to Paris.,(108 Central Ave between Jefferson St & Troutman St),espresso ★★★★,
price ★★★,
atmosphere ★★★,
staff ★★★★★,
overall ★★★ and 1/2★,If you can get a speat near the window, Central Cafe is a nice little spot. It has 3 big lounge chairs and 3 small tables so don’t expect too much space or any out-of-the-way seating. But the staff was on their game and the menu was small but solid, featuring pumpkin and nutella lattes and some tempting sandwiches. The espresso was decent; tangy with just a little aftertaste. It’s cash only and a bit dusty but all in all, a delightful little cafe.,(24 Irving Ave between Jefferson St & Melrose St),espresso ★★★★★,
price ★★★,
atmosphere ★★★★,
staff ★★★★★,
overall ★★★★ and 1/2★,I’d say Cafe Ghia is the most grown up and sophisticated place on the list. It’s a great spot to come for brunch on a weekend or sit at the bar and have a glass of wine in the evening. I came in for an espresso, sat at the bar where the New York Times was waiting for me, and was waited on like I was important or something. The staff here is ridiculously nice and accommodating and the espresso is stellar; bright, airy, and smooth. The Chalkboards on the wall inform you of the continually changing but always enticing menu. It’s quite refined (especially for Bushwick) and a little more expensive but not outlandishly so. Go to this place.,(1087 Flushing Ave between Knickerbocker Ave & Porter Ave),espresso ★★★★,
price ★★★★,
atmosphere ★★★★,
staff ★★★★,
overall ★★★★,When I first walked into Kavé, I was a bit confused by the decor. The palm plants and large wicker chairs covered in leather make me think of a tropical island. But the color scheme is decidedly brown and the cast iron gate that serves as the front door sheds no light on the situation. Those chairs though are surprisingly comfortable and the vibe here is relaxed and welcoming. It’s probably the largest cafe on the list, especially counting the courtyard I look forward to enjoying when the weather warms up. There’s an abundance of small tables to sit at with your laptop or a book. I also noticed they have a piano, a chess board, and Scrabble on hand. The espresso was fierce and delicious. The rest of the menu includes pumpkin lattes, Italian sodas, a variety of nutmilks, and a good selection of sandwiches and pastries. They also have a fairly awesome antique cash register. A great place to spend the day undisturbed.,(247 Varet St between White St & Bogart St),espresso ★★★★,
price ★★★★,
atmosphere ★★★★,
staff ★★★,
overall ★★★★,I want to like Cafe Orwell because everything is black. It is dark which is awesome but it is loud sometimes which is not necessarily awesome but it has Sessions Lager which is awesome. Being near Bogart and right next door to the Loft Hostel though, it can be tough to get a table to yourself. Too many large, communal tables if you ask me. But the espresso here is robust and flavorful. They have a good variety of sandwiches, salads, bagels, and biscotti. And even bike parking out front. It has some great old chandeliers too, a half piano, and usually a good, eccentric crowd.,(30 Wyckoff Ave @ wait for it… Starr!),espresso ★★★★★,
price ★★★★,
atmosphere ★★★,
staff ★★★★,
overall ★★★★ and 1/2★,Located directly beside the beloved Hana Foods, Wyckoff Starr is probably the smallest cafe on the list. But also probably the best place to people-watch. The menu features sandwiches from Cafe Ghia (the owners of both places overlap) and drinks like The Grasshopper (iced mint mocha) and the Bees Knees (honey latte). The espresso really hits the spot though with a roasty flavor and a perky finish. To get a seat at one of the tables here is a miracle but I usually take my coffee to go and sit on one of the benches outside or hop right onto the L train. This is a busy cafe but the staff is quick, kind, and on the ball. And if you’re from out of town, be sure to mark your spot on their impressive “Where In The World Are You From?” map.,Admittedly, there are many more cafes in Bushwick and “East Williamsburg” that I didn’t get to. I’m sorry if your neighborhood caffeine provider didn’t make the list. If you’d like me to keep going (or cease and desist at once), just leave a comment.,Happy sipping!,It’s kind of hard to sit back and then remember what it’s like being a kid. Not your “childhood,” but being “a kid” specifically. A friend slaps a bracelet on your wrist that immediately curls up. Your brother yells that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon is on, but your sister is occupying the TV watching 90210. You conquer your Super Mario Brothers on Nintendo as you sit among metallic Pogs and trippy Lisa Frank folders, snacking on War Heads and Fruit Roll-Ups. All the while a toy is beeping somewhere in your closet (you assume it’s the Tamagotchi you have been neglecting.), , ,…. simply awesome! The art opening and the 90s dance party was crafted in the kitchen of ,, our artsy lil’ sister, and brought to life thanks to our dear friends ,.  Last Friday night has proved once again that the power of creative collaboration is amazing.,To sum it up, , is the 1st Bushwick gallery based purely in the virtual space. Its mission is to endorse emerging artists of the area, and to bring art closer to young people using the power of the Internet. In monthly (usually small group shows), is BushwickGallery.com focusing on discovering the talent! The L Magazine named BushwicGallery.com 1 of the , in Brooklyn of 2011!,However, every online art show begins with an offline opening, every time at a different Bushwick art space., is an art show, which explores the spotty memories, bringing forward the perceptions, images, shapes and colors of the lavish decade of the 1990 in the works of ,, , and ,. For the offline opening Bushwick Gallery teamed up with 950 Hart Gallery, which are a great chill art space located in a duplex loft complex off Dekalb stop (L train). These guys have been around since 2010, and , was their 20th art show. We can’t thank them enough for the relaxed vibe and great atmosphere of their home they shared with us… Oh, and the dance party was amazing. About 150 people showed up and a bunch of them joined us for absolutely rad dance party in the 1990s style after 10pm. Apropos, the dance party was insanely good. , was spinning and spinning hard. You are probably imagining amazing, so we now need you to close your eyes and multiply this feeling by 1000. Yes, now you’re close to how amazing he was.  You will definitely hear more of this guy on Bushwick Daily soon.,The art was fresh! Energetic colors, geometric patterns, collages, pixels, Super Mario Mushroom, all was there…. Andrea Bergart with her geometry 90s styled oil paintings was a great bridge between totally insane Ken Kocses and geometry clean Matthew Mahler. For those of you who missed it, and would like to see the physical art, we have some good news. The show will be hanging at 950 Hart Gallery until the end of this week. If you want to see it, ,, and we can make it happen every day after 6pm. If you want to enjoy the art, but you can’t close your laptop and leave (we can understand these moments), just go to , and browse endlessly!!, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,One of the Bushwick’s newest mysteries , is nestled into what looks like a converted garage on Troutman street. The space houses all sorts of activities, acting as a yoga center, art space, performance venue, community kitchen, and more. All activities are aimed at bettering the self and learning while doing so. Basically, it’s one of the most open-ended DIY spaces in Brooklyn. They host yoga twice daily throughout the week and also have an excellent Cosmic Yoga session every Sunday evening. I joined them for their last cosmic yoga session before they closed to undergo some renovations.,Our class was lead by Amy, whom you may have seen somewhere around Bushwick with her huge smile and carefree attitude. She’s teaches a mellow Vinyasa yoga class with Kundalini breathing elements. It’s a very personal experience to do yoga in the quiet, dark, and chilly studio, where no one cares or even notices how long you can hold a shoulder stand. During cosmic yoga the experience is even more special- the session features live music! Last week a cellist played slow, beautiful, theraputic songs that really made the practice more sensory and enveloping. The cathartic class lasted about an hour and a half, featured very personal direction, and cost a mere ten dollars.,After the class finished a crowed of others arrived to enjoy the raw vegan meal that followed. A few cooks crowded the small kitchen and served thai-themed goods they had prepared for the occassion. The meal was beautiful! Big thanks to Nick, one of the chefs who prepared the feast, who sent me over a list of ingredients and items! The meal featured a smorgasborg of vegan dishes, including:,It was delicious, healthy, and local!,Keep your eyes and ears out for future events, comic and daily yoga at the BAC, which will re-open in a few weeks with a fresh new shene. , to get all the details.,Take your significant other/person you’re courting/Bushwickian you met last night on a scenic Bushwick walk. And by scenic, I mean among some of Bushwick’s saddest streets. Jefferson street between Irving and Wycoff is pretty bleak, but together you can conquer the loneliness of this urban wasteland. Count forgotten plastic dime baggies, take pictures of warped tires draped upon bushes, try not to inhale too much car exhaust. You might get suddenly afraid by how loud your footprints sound bouncing between warehouses and have to hold hands! ROMANTIC. *Also recommended* Johnson St East of Varick, Locust Street turning into Lewis Ave.,Thrift stores! What better way to connect with someone than to scavenge through racks of ridiculous clothing. Try on costumes together, pick out things for each other, steal things as a team. Green Village @ 276 Starr Street and , @ 118 Knickerbocker St are just a couple good ones in the hood. Happy shopping!,One can never go wrong with Burger King- least that’s a rule that my roommate and her boyfriend go by. There’s a convinient BK down on Broadway near the Myrtle/Broadway stop, but hey, it’s Valentine’s Day and the Burger King on Broadway is really special. Hail a gypsy cap to the corner of Myrtle and Knickerbocker and open your eyes to the unforgettable 50′s diner style Burger King, complete with antique-car-booths. Now get two whopper value meals, (or veggie burger value meals if that’s your preference) settle in the hottest car booth, and watch the valentine’s day cliente file in (they’re bound to entertain),Go to , just the day before Valentine’s and and enjoy the half price bottle of wine they offer in this Bushwick establishment every Monday. Because cheap wine never failed to put ya in the mood….,
…Or take your act on the road and perform at , Tuesday Night Teacup Open Mic. If your Valentine survives this, they will survive everything! Just keep it clean.,As more OWS supporters started to come out of winter/holiday hibernation, I decided I wanted to start focusing on connecting at a local level. The events I participated in during the end of 2011 were all “standalone” and I was looking to find a group I could meet with regularly and help create something more cohesive and sustainable. After some Googling, I found ,, started chatting with a few other members, and we decided to get together.,About six of us, counting my fiance Deb and myself, ended up meeting at , on Wednesday 1/25. We had an open conversation about our backgrounds, core issues, and what we are looking to accomplish through OWS. The consensus was to meet again the following Wednesday and to try and keep GAs going on a regular basis. We knew that it would be inappropriate to set any formal agenda with so few people, so we left that open and just focused on spreading the word. The goal at this point would simply be to bring in more people and listen. We also agreed that it would be good to have one person give a half-hour skill-share or teach-in at each week’s meeting. I volunteered to do the first one, focused on helping people to consume and contribute to the digital conversation more efficiently and effectively.,At 7pm on 2/1, the following Wednesday, my family and I arrived at Kave, taped one of our “OCCUPY BUSHWICK” flyers to a table, and waited for people to arrive. Within ten minutes, the cafe was filled with Occupiers, most of whom I had never met before. Since that night was unusually warm, we opted to take the gathering out into the courtyard behind the coffee shop. I setup two laptops, one for live streaming and another for demonstration purposes, and I commenced my skill-share.  I primarily focused on social networking, micro-blogging, and leveraging the tools on occupybk.org. I emphasized that all of these are most effective when they are supported by offline interactions such as meetings like these. I wrapped up my talk going over an , I designed with a basic primer on HTML tags and useful links for participating in OWS digitally.,I wasn’t able to watch or participate in the about 90% of the actual General Assembly, as my eleven month old son decided he wanted to practice saying “Yayayah! YahaahYahYa!”, nonstop, for about two whole hours. Luckily, Deb was recording the whole event as we simultaneously live-streamed to about 12-20 viewers. So I spent the better part of last night watching the tape a few minutes at a time and summarizing each person’s contribution to the discussion. I’ve also linked to several local tweeters that were commenting on our discussion as it happened.,Format: ,Topic: ,Side Topic: ,Local LiveTweeters:,, ,, ,, ,, ,, a set of  street art twin brothers, celebrated their birthday last Friday at ,. Instead of cakes, games, line dancing and presents, there was beer, wooden sneakers,  giant dice used as chairs, and the musical styling’s of the band Anxiateam, comprised of the artists responsible for the gallery’s outdoor spaces, , and ,.,When you walk in the gallery, it’s as if three decades of Skewville’s work was put in a pile and then blown up. Every inch of the space is covered in the duo’s very recognizable style. The big block wood and/or cement cut outs that spell thinks like “skew” “NYC” “Hype” and “power” among many other things commanded the space, marking it as their own.,Marking territory is a practice Skewville is very familiar with.  One piece in the show is a lawn mower designed to mow the words “Keep On the Grass.” And more famously, strewn about the space is Skewville’s “When Dogs Fly” pieces. Ever see sneakers strung up over telephone lines in the city? Skewville has been practicing this ritual since they were children, and look at it as a way of making their mark in a place. “When Dogs Fly” refers to the busted shoes that adorn your tired achy feet, or “dogs”. Each sneaker is painted on wood, and then can be cut out and strung up over telephone lines. Skewville has been peddling this practice all around the country, customizing certain dogs to certain places, and leaving their mark on the wires.,This show is like entering Willy Wonka’s factory, but instead of imaginative versions of  sweets we have that of street culture. There are recognizable bright images and objects everywhere, cement blocks, fire hydrants, dice, traffic barriers, and yet they are all “wonkafied,” or Skewvillified into a dream land of cartoon-like and stylized pieces to reflect the impression this team has left on their city.,Since I’ve been invited to post here on an ongoing basis, I figured I’d introduce myself to the readership before I post my first official report on local Occupation events. I am not an impartial observer, as the Occupy Wall Street movement is very personal to me. I feel that it is important to tell the story of my journey within OWS so far, if for no other reason than to encourage other Occupiers to share their own.,I moved to Bushwick in January of 2011 with my pregnant girlfriend, Deb. We met at ,, enjoying the night lives of amateur ,/,. We fell for each other pretty hard, pretty quick. Both of us are computer professionals, I do web design, she does video editing. At the end of February 2011, our son Dominic Oscar Douglas was born (named for my grandfather and the fact that he was born on Oscar night). As anyone will tell you, having a child changes the way you look at the world: it extends your view of the future. I was lucky to have concluded a big freelance gig just before his birth, which allowed me to stay at home for his first two months and just , with him and Deb fully. I loved it. It was the first break I’d given myself from following politics in quite a long time. I got by working from home until July, when I landed a full-time job animating banner ads for a major bank (oh, life).,I have always occupied my down time reading the news and blogs (especially ,, whom I have been reading daily since 2005), but rarely engaged in any actual activism apart from trying to support the Howard Dean campaign in 2003.,
We all remember how that panned out, right?,The issues that worried me during the Bush years have only gotten worse: corporate control of government oversight and legislation, the growing acceptance of the idea of a “unitary” executive branch that can act in secret with no judicial review, indefinite detention, and worst of all, the escalation of the wars on drugs and “terror”. I voted for Obama because he said all the right things regarding these issues during the 2008 campaign, but his actions have since nullified the power of his words for me. Having a child now, I have momentary bouts of depression about the world he’s likely to live in if these issues are not addressed. Suffice to say, I was pretty cynical and fatalistic about the political landscape before the Occupation began.,I first became aware of OWS when a , I’m friends with posted a video of himself performing at Zuccotti on Facebook. It wasn’t long after that I recognized this movement’s significance in the way it “activated” so many friends who were typically apolitical or totally cynical. I saw them participating in early marches, most significantly the Brooklyn Bridge. The significance of that  mass arrest in galvanizing these early supporters cannot be understated. After seeing all this play out on Facebook and Twitter for a week, I started to spend whatever time I could in Zuccotti after work and on weekends, knowing that it wouldn’t last for very long. Most of the time I would just hang out and watch, maybe have a quick conversation with the person by my side. Before long, I would go down on my lunch break and hold up this sign:,I was immediately captivated by the possibilities of consensus-focused democracy using the General Assembly process, and fell in love with the tools of the Occupation such as audience feedback, orderly discussions, and of course the human mic. About a week after being exposed to the last tool I realized it would be a beautiful way to propose to Deb (good mic checks read like poetry, btw). So I went to a flea market to up-cycle a ring from a local merchant, wrote out some words, and emailed some friends a time & place to meet. I told her we were gonna hang out and play music. Here’s what happened instead:,As I uploaded the video, I was certain that everyone we were friends with on facebook would love it and be happy for us. I didn’t expect to be on , by 3pm the next day and at 100k views two weeks later. The experience galvanized our support for the movement, and reading through the YouTube comments as the video spread, I really internalized the uphill battle we face in terms of challenging the assumptions of people supporting OWS. We have since used every media inquiry into our story as an opportunity to articulate specifically why we are supporting this movement, a topic that would take up much more space than this introductory post should be.,Soon after the proposal Deb and I started working with ,, which we became aware through the , they organized (that same night, a lunatic decided to ,). Through most of the winter, POWS was my primary focus. I formed a real bond with the original organizer and a core group of other parents around NYC that I’ve continued to kept in touch. We’ve organized some small events such as a Children’s GA and march against the “bullies” in the NYPD.,The second video faced a similar barrage of baseless attacks in the comments, which I addressed at the ,‘s Wednesday open mic.,And that pretty much brings us up to date with my involvement in the Occupation up the first Occupy Bushwick General Assembly of 2012. Check back in the next day or two for my first report on the ,.,I believe this movement must make every effort to be as transparent as possible in order to juxtapose itself with the secrecy-obsessed government we are trying to reform. I support this movement without any shred anonymity, despite the risks it could pose to myself and my family. I could very well lose my job animating Flash advertisements for a major bank and the medical benefits that come with it if the wrong people at my company learn of my involvement in OWS. Many other supporters face the same dilemma, in much more precarious positions than mine.,Finally, it should be understood that the opinions and observations I am writing here are mine and in no way influenced by any collective agreement with the people I’m covering. Hopefully everyone who attends the events that I cover will read these articles and feel free to correct the record in the comments if they ever feel I have misrepresented them.,. The names of the paintings by , document the journey you undertake when you take a dive into his work. References to the video games, encounters with aliens, rad 1990s TV shows, Native American motives… The visual language of Matthew Mahler is peculiarly odd, magical, and fascinating. Yet his works feel so familiar to someone who grew up in the ’90s, and was surrounded by the same pop culture and the common objects of fascination. Matthew Mahler says that it took him a long time to figure out how to create art that represents what he knows the best. He talks about his MFA break as the time when he was able to fully focus on his work and make a lot of progress in finding himself., ","

This combination of bands doesn’t leave us with anything else that to absolutely recommend stopping by Shea Stadium tonight for a dance! Music will be rad!,Vaudeville Park presents a really interesting social media-related art show on Thursday. Artists Adam Eckstrom, Bonnie Pipkin, Jen Rodewald, Brina Thurston, and Ian Umlauf used their photography to tell diverse stories about their lives, interests and creative spheres on their Facebook pages.  When removed from their original context the images stand on their own as autonomous works of art with strong narrative and emotional content. The arrays of images document their way of thinking and moving through the real world, while playing with the mechanisms of the social media platform.,A popular bar Tandem is presenting their second of movie night on Tuesday night. They will be screening Bridesmaids! Do we need to say more?,We Are Cinema is a month-long exhibit and screening series celebrating 50 years of the Film-Makers’ Co-op in NYC. It was in January of 1962 that filmmaker Jonas Mekas called an urgent meeting of about 20 avant-garde/independent filmmakers including Stan Vanderbeek, Rudy Burckhardt, Jack Smith, Ken Jacobs, and Gregory Markopoulos to discuss taking the means of exhibition and distribution into their own hands. Within months the Film-Makers’ Co-op was born. Under the stewardship of filmmaker MM Serra since 1991, the organization is now the oldest and largest artist-run cooperative in the world and membership continues to be open to anyone with a film or video work.,“56 Bogart? What?” Christina Ray, the co-owner of Soho gallery ,, was pretty surprised when I told her about the rumor that the Bushwick location of her gallery was supposed to be at ,, the new gallery arcade across the street from Cafe Swallow. After the reports from , and ,, we know that the location of Kesting/Ray is 257 Boerum Street in East Williamsburg.,A building in the shape of a little hangar seems to be very familiar to almost everyone in Bushwick. I was curious about new location of Kesting/Ray, and went to chat with Christina Ray directly. Christina - accompanied by her cute orange cat – showed me their new space, which is still partially under reconstruction, and she told me that Bushwick location won’t have regular gallery hours like the Soho gallery. “It will be an event and project space,” she said.  Christina also said that they would like to experiment in Bushwick more than they do in Soho, and they have already made some exciting plans. In March, they will present an architectural installation of a Brooklyn-based sculptor, ,.,Kesting/Ray represents several awesome artists, including street artist ,. They currently have two of Swoon’s pieces hanging inside, and there is another awesome Swoon pasted on the outside. Christina said that they didn’t know about that when they were buying the building. It’s just a lucky coincidence.,While Kesting/Ray is, with its love for street art and experimental installations, nothing like the art world giant Luhring Augustine who also bought a building in Bushwick, one cannot help but wonder what the move of the galleries from the city will create in the neighborhood. Christina said that she went to the , talk at The Bogart Salon held last month, and it was interesting. Both she and her husband David Kesting used to have galleries in Williamsburg, and so they can tell “,“. Christina says that she does observe the change, however doesn’t like to get involved in the politics of it.,Christina Ray and David Kesting are both also artists and Bushwick residents. Christina said that they have so many friends in the neighborhood, it was only natural to open their second location here.,[mappress mapid=""18""],Candles, welcoming neon sign, tall windows, classy interior…That’s a new bar that opened less than 3 weeks ago at 101 Wilson Ave in Bushwick. I popped in out of curiosity only to find myself welcomed by a photo of , on the wall, the dog that lent his name to the place, and his friendly owner Daniel Romero, who runs and co-owns this place with his boyfriend Travis. While we were talking, Phoebe, a wine enthusiast and a bartender at Miles, came in and told me all about their stellar wine selection, and the process of wine curating. Travis added praise of their wide beer list, and most importantly, Daniel described the specialty bar food – slow-cooked meals. Daniel has been experimenting with a slow-cooker for about a year and came up with this awesome idea of to offer a delicious slow-cooked bite to pair with the wine…,It is pretty inspiring to talk to Bushwick business owners, especially because it seems that every single business is someone’s dream coming true, such as the case of Daniel Romero who worked in architecture for years. I had a bunch of questions about how that dream became reality, and here is what Daniel, Travis and Phoebe told me about it….,Danny: He is a Cairn Terrier; like Toto.,Danny: Yeah. I have lived here for nearly 6 years.,Danny: I’ve kind of always wanted to open some sort of a bar or a restaurant type of place; and it finally seemed like the right time. Having lived here for nearly six years, and having finally found a place that feels like home with a community to be a part of… It felt like this is the right time.,Travis: I like the fact that there are more places to go out to. There used to be so few places to go to have dinner or a drink… The neighborhood has changed, but I still feel like the core of Bushwick is here. You have artists here; you have Puertoricans and Dominicans here, and it feels like we are one big happy family.,Danny: It is one big family. I don’t like the term gentrification…. I don’t really think that that’s what’s happening. If you want to put a term on it, it’s happening everywhere in New York, not just here.,My vision for the place has always been to create a comfortable beer and wine bar;  the kind of place where you just want to hang out, and be able to have a conversation.,Also a date place, yes. It’s not a rowdy bar. But first and foremost it’s beer and wine bar, which is reflected in our beer list and in our wine menu. The idea was also that it was a beer and wine bar that served really good bar food.,[She laughs.] I have worked in wine since I was 19, before I was even legally allowed to drink it, and I love it so much! My roots are definitely in Italian wine. I have worked in this neighborhood for a little over four years now. That’s how I know these guys; just from having bartended at several other places in the neighborhood. I really enjoy wine, and I am really proud of the wine list we have created here. About half of our wines are either biodynamic or organic and sustainable. Trying the wines we have here now feels like we did such a good job! There isn’t a single dud on the menu!,Danny: Oh, yeah, it was fun! We worked with distributors who set up tastings with us here before we opened. We had several Wednesday nights when we were a little drunk [he laughs]. It was a very fun process. Very exciting too!,Phoebe: One of the distributors we wanted to work with was Savio Soares, who deals primarily in biodynamic and organic sustainable wines. Our baby right now is Champs de Cailloux. I think it was the last one we tried on our 1st wine tasting, and we thought it was so fantastic, we immediately committed to a huge order. So far everyone has been gravitating towards that wine. It is really amazing!,Danny: We took the same amount of care in curating the beer menu as well. We wanted to give our guests a nicer beer menu; something better than what you can get at other places in the neighborhood.,Pheobe: We feel like there is this generic beer list that you see in most of the bars, not only in this neighborhood. We wanted more than just average.,Danny: We also carry the whole Sixpoint line, which is sort of a staple in all the Bushwick bars.,Travis: We don’t have any PBRs, Bud Light or Coors…,Danny: We found this place through our friend Shari, who used to be sort of a Bushwick’s real estate guru. She doesn’t do that anymore, but she knows a lot of people and buildings in the neighborhood. She helped us find this place, which used to be quite a run down bodega. When we came here, we had to completely gut the entire space. We did most of the work here ourselves. We did everything from the wallpaper on the ceiling to the bar and the wood back here. We even made the light fixtures.,Danny: We had our hands in everything here. The floor is the original floor of the building, which is nearly 100 years old. I also have a really cool photo of this building from the 1930s…,Danny: What makes Bushwick home for us is the community…The people we have grown to consider family.,Travis: And camaraderie too. Everyone is really willing to help out. Other business owners have been really great and helpful.  There isn’t a lot of competition going on. Everybody shares the information.,Pheobe: That’s actually very evident in just the staff we have right now. All of our bartenders have two jobs in this neighborhood. I work at Café Ghia and some other bartenders work at Tandem. And it’s not a conflict of interest. It’s like a family.,Danny: Yes, I feel like all the business owners here are like a little family, which is nice.,I am an architect. I have a master degree in architecture. I worked in architecture for about 10 years before I went more freelance for the past 3 years, but it got to a point when….,Yeah, I was in art school, 18 years old, and I remember telling my parents that I just want to get an art degree and open up a hotel or a restaurant. I just wanted to walk around and take photographs and make art. My parents thought I was crazy and they pushed me to get a “real” career, so I just picked the most creative profession I could find, architecture, and immersed myself in that. However, the corporate world wasn’t really for me… It was something that I wasn’t ever really happy doing. Then once I found myself in Bushwick and I really didn’t see myself leaving anytime soon, I decided it was time to pursue this dream….,Congratulations to you!,Completely unaware of anything, basically, last Friday I accepted an invitation to check out a Bushwick gallery that I haven’t heard about before. And damn, was it a good decision., is located on 407 Johnson Ave in a converted factory. You walk through a hallway that leads all the way to the back. There is a nice space with tall ceiling, and most importantly, with great art!,Youth Group Gallery is currently presenting a solo show of , titled ,. Her 3D works made using paper and other materials are really impressive and engaging to look at. Particularly enjoyable is an installation of paper birds and disco balls. It reminded me of paradise with a glimpse of hell… Awesome are her figurative sculptures, and faces with brains dripping. As a creator, Michelle has great sense of humor…,Additionally, it seems like the life of Michelle Matson has been full of insane events. Last year she came to the attention of media, because she survived an ,; and later she was on the second season of Bravo TV’s art reality show, “,.” Also read the interview with her on ,.,“Yaay!” Happy as a little girl who just found a great toy, Ashley Zelinskie grabbed my shoulder as soon as I walked into , this past Saturday night. “You have to try my ,!” she said, clapping her hands. She handed me a toy moustache on a stick. Ashley proudly pointed to a cardboard booth she had concocted for ,. Loud music blasting, crowds of people as excited as Ashley, I walked into the booth where a laptop captures a series of images of me with my toy moustache generating a , that was immediately projected simultaneously in the gallery and onto a video billboard in midtown Manhattan.,And this was just the beginning of the most entertaining art event I had been to in months — Art Hack Day at 319 Scholes.,READ MORE & CHECK OUT MORE PHOTOS ON ,Life along the JMZ subway lines in Bushwick is flowing like a peaceful river, seemingly unaffected by the move of big galleries to the neighborhood. While the L train section of Bushwick is quietly whispering the “G” word and talks about getting priced out, JMZ Bushwick lives a different story.,We all heard that Beaty Bar, a popular bar at 921 Broadway, is leaving its Bushwick location for Park Slope because it was not making enough money. Beauty Bar Bushwick opened in , as a rougher little brother of Beauty Bar on East 14th Street, where you could have a drink and some beautification procedure done at the same time.  , is a chain of bars all around the country with locations in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, Denver, Chicago, Portland, Austin and Las Vegas. However, over the years, the owner Paul Devitt realized that Bushwick isn’t as good of a location as he expected. “The area was not developing as fast as we had hoped,” said Beauty Bar owner Paul Devitt for ,. “A lot of kids in Bushwick are strapped financially. They drink at home, at parties.” In Park Slope, Devitt is expecting a hipster clientele who has gotten married, had a baby, but still wants to be stimulated.,Oh well, we all got wasted at Beauty Bar at least once in our lifetime, but it’s true that the place hasn’t been exactly crowded lately. We asked what your opinions are about Beaty Bar leaving, and got several interesting responses.,Nate Gene and JP Marin said on our ,:,We asked our Twitter followers to share their stories from the Beauty Bar, but we didn’t get too many. The best sum up came from Daniel Carrol:,So I guess this is it, Beauty Bar. We will (probably) miss you but at the same time, there is so much is going on in the neighborhood that we won’t be sad for too long. Actually, there is already a replacement for the Monday movie night. , has just started movie nights on Tuesdays! And honestly, Bushwick girls don’t really care about manicures. Their nails get dirty from acrylic paint and short from guitars strings. But good luck in your new neighborhood, hopefully your new crowd will get that babysitter for the night…,What’s the connection between Richard Brautigan and bed bugs? Now, you know….,“In watermelon sugar the deeds were done and done again as my life is done in watermelon sugar.” These are the emblematic words at the beginning of the cult book , by Richard Brautigan. This photo was taken at the corner of Moore and White Street. It seems like the loft buildings in that area have quite a severe bed bug problem. Mattresses, beds and other furniture can be frequently found abandoned. Luckily, creative Bushwick inhabitants take this rather unpleasant life circumstance as a stimulus for more art. Let’s take this occasion to think about already famous ,… Keep on fighting, guys…,
,“Hipster brunch is a late, low fi version of brunch in East Williamsburg,” said the ironic invitation from Rob de Oude from ,. Last weekend was the final weekend for their current exhibition , (and Matthew Mahler and Andrew Zarou in the Project Space), and actually the final exhibition weekend for Camel Art Space as well. Indeed, Camel Art Space is moving from their current location on 722 Metropolitan to 1717 Troutman in Bushwick. I stopped by to check out the , art at Camel, and to chat with Rob de Oude and Enrico Gomez about their upcoming move.,One of the reasons for the move is that many galleries left the area and Camel became sort of an isolated animal in East Williamsburg. However, the main reason for the move is of practical nature. The building on Metropolitan Ave has become increasingly unstable. Leaks and other unsafe conditions are not the best spaces to store and exhibit art…That’s why Rob and his fellows from Camel didn’t hesitate to sign the lease at 1717 Troutman. Unlike other art spaces who are coming to Bushwick because of the increasing hype of the place in the art world, for Camel the move to Bushwick is more than natural. Not only does the space have more of a Bushwick than Williamsburg vibe, but Rob has lived in Bushwick for over six years and is actually happy that he can walk to his studio after several years of L train trouble.,Camel is not only moving their gallery but also their art studios. Rob said that the new space will be smaller, but they are welcoming the decrease of space as they want to focus on smaller and solo person art shows for the future, and get deeper into curation. They also want to exhibit more of their own work, as Camel Art Space was focusing mostly on big group shows and guest curators. Camel Art Space will be losing its name and is also leaving their mascot, the wood camel, behind. The camel came with the building, and no one would refer to the building differently as a result. The artists haven’t decided on the new name yet, and to my tiny disappointment, they ruled out animals from the selection [*sigh*]. The new space will be ready for the 1st show in April. We can’t wait!,Camel Art Space has been operating on Metroplolitan Ave since 2008, though Rob de Oude has been renting his studio in the building for at least 10 years.  Camel Art Space started as a collective of artists who had studios in the building, and who were aspiring to curate group shows and to show their own work in the gallery space.  Rob said that the decision to use the space at 722 Metropolitan as a gallery followed the recession peak of 2008, after which many galleries in Williamsburg had to close down. He felt like Camel has the necessary space and enthusiasm to fill in the sudden gap, and has been doing a great job since.,Welcome to Bushwick*, guys!,We are entering February this week, folks. And as the winter slowly proceeds, let’s look at how you can get involved in the community of Bushwick on various levels. Among other things, let’s not forget that we are not done with #OWS yet, and Bushwick is a large hub for important events. Here is how you can get involved in Bushwick community:, is a community organization dedicated to the enrichment and preservation of Bushwick. It is a part of the Occupy Brooklyn movement, and if you caught yourself fretting about the recent development of Bushwick using the “G” word at least 5 times in the past 3 days, we suggest you come to , in The Loom on Wednesday, and actually talk about what you can do to create socially sustainable environment in Bushwick.,To accompany the #ows movement, ,is hosting an interesting film series, which focuses on ’80s-90s cautionary tales: movies from the margin, standing in the long shadow of Reagan and Thatcher. Their common vision is that of everyday life tortured into goose-step with an expensive and sophisticated police state and cheap and vulgar consumer goods. Alternating between B-movie blockbusters and indies, the worlds of REPO MAN and ROBOCOP, the films expose possible results of the dysfunctional relationship between a people and their government., is a quarterly printed publication that features short stories, essays, poetry, photography, recipes, paintings, drawings, plays, comics, and basically anything that can be printed on a black-and-white page. It is also a growing community of creative people. On Saturday, Bushwick Review will bring readings of 11 writers. Also check out new yoga spot in the neighborhood, Body Actualized.,Many know Paul D’Agostino as a Bushwick pioneer who opened ,, a gallery at his loft at Moore St. Many know Paul as a highly sophisticated curator and the community supporter. Many know Paul as a professor of Italian language and literature at Brooklyn College, and many know Paul as a contributor to ,. However, not enough people know that Paul D’Agostino is also an extremely talented artist himself… Come to look at the art and listen to the writings of one of the people who made this neighborhood a great spot on Earth. This Friday at ,., is featuring a regular 1st Friday of the month exhibition.  This month, The Loom Gallery will present Billy Hahn’s most recent paintings, drawings, collages, and installation. SAGOPALM – a band that is allegedly known for melting faces, making young girls tear up, and mapping out a new diagram to the distant stars – will perform. 1st Fridays at the Loom are always a nice occasion to hang out with your neighbors and to meet other members of the Bushwick community.","

"are a trio you should get to know by ,. They’ve gathered a light buzz around Brooklyn, one of the members hailing from Bushwick, and having shared bills with groups such as ,. For this young, refreshing band there’s nowhere to go but up, having already released their debut 8-song LP, , and playing at ,, where I caught them last week.,Listen to and download “Under the Whale,” the 3rd track off Beach Arab’s , EP here:,The first genre that comes to mind when listening to their music is punk, but they create such a blend of different influences that it’s hard to label them as a strictly punk or rock band. They experiment with their sound- different songs follow varying moods- incorporating surf, garage, experimental, grunge and jazz influences. The most obvious thing about their music is that they aren’t playing around. Despite playful jamming and scattered percussion that seem to segment their music, they power through each song with serious intention, riffs picking up on forgotten song elements from earlier on, bringing the listener full circle on each song. Guitarist Liz Hogg plays her electric guitar as the band’s primary voice and melody maker, though when they do incorporate lyrics, they gain a level of relatability which makes them seem more like a 90′s rock band. If they had to be grouped with some influences we might be able to hear, I hear a smashing sample with little bit of Modest Mouse, Yuck, Pavement, Deerhunter… if you added a super-shredder guitar.,Switching gears from hardcore guitar parts to more tropical melodies on songs like (name-track) Beach Arabs, they remind us of just why their sound is so refreshing. There is no doubt in the way they lay out their songs, where a band as new and young as this might find pockets of insecurity, they instead reinforce their unique sound by going even harder.  On “Under the Whale” we are reminded of the band’s punk roots and moody noise elements, then swiftly transformed to a lighter, less demanding listening spot with rhythmic guitar sweeps.  The guitar sound is strong, precise, and powerful, the drums crash emotionally, and the bass bumps around in a very energetic way. To sum it up, The Beach Arabs are unapologetic.  And this is why they are our Bushwick Music Crush. Look out for their second full length album, which they are currently recording to be release in 2012.,A week before Christmas of 1981, a teaching position opened at Roland Hayes Intermediate School 291. Meryl Meisler says she could only imagine what happened to the teacher before her. “Was the other teacher killed?” she asked herself. Another cause of anxiety for Meryl was the New York Blackout that occurred in the summer of 1977, and its disastrous consequences for Bushwick. “After, images of looting and fires in Bushwick were forever burned into my brain,” Meryl says.,Nevertheless, Meryl Meisler accepted the offer and taught in Bushwick from 1981 to 1994, and she says it was never boring. In February 1982, she found the courage to take photos on her way from the subway to school. She used to carry an inexpensive plastic point and shoot pocket camera loaded with cheap transparency film and developed it in the least costly way possible.,30 years later, the neighborhood has made its comeback, and Meryl Meisler’s photographs of Bushwick from the 1980s are invaluable historical material with high aesthetic value added. Hopefully, you had a chance to see the exhibition of Meryl Meisler’s photography at , ,which ran until December 31, 2011.,Nowadays, Meryl Meisler continues to take photographs of Bushwick. “My goal is to walk and photograph every street in Bushwick. Doesn’t that sound like fun?” We think it definitely does! Furthermore, looking at her old and new photos, Meryl subliminally and overtly sees the connecting detail between the past and the present, and seizes the moment of time.,Drawing the parallels between the old and the new, Meryl creates diptychs. Looking at the diptychs, one is reminded of the change and revival of Bushwick, but simulateously sees that some things (luckily) remain the same….,We are honored to present Meryl Meisler’s emerging series ,, and we promise that you will hear more of this remarkable photographer on Bushwick Daily soon.,Have you ever wondered what the sewers underneath Knickerbocker Avenue look like? These guys, Steve and Andrew wondered too. So they went down to check them out and they made this video. In the 1880s, Bushwick was the nation’s capital for breweries and that made for a lot of wastewater. A couple of miles of extension sewer were built underneath Knickerbocker Avenue to bring the wastewater directly to the East River.,Urban historian Steve Duncan and a filmmaker Andrew Wonder teamed up to create this amazing guerilla city and urban exploration project called ,. Steve describes this fascinating project on their website:,[quote]As an urban historian & photographer, I try to peel back the layers of a city to see what’s underneath. From the tops of bridges to the depths of sewer tunnels, these explorations of the urban environment help me puzzle together the interconnected, multi-dimensional history and complexity of the great metropolises of the world.[/quote],“Beneath New York City lies a vast network of abandoned tunnels, caverns, nooks and crannies that the average joe will never see,” , reports today.,If you want to follow more footage form under the city by Steve and Andrew, you should check out ,, which is an interactive mapping website that captures and presents personal video accounts of the life and culture of New York City. These guys are creating “an intimate, evolving, and complete portrait of this great city”. Users upload videos geographically, building the first fully interactive video map of New York City.,In case you are one of the 5 remaining people in Brooklyn who haven’t seen , yet, we’re posting it for you. Brokelandia is a hilarious response to the popular show , from our fellow Brooklyn bloggers, ,!

In ,, two friends (pretty aggressive foodies, if you ask me) are racing each other in who can eat the most sophisticated meal. From beer flavored salty caramel cookies to giant roasted sheep. And month-long waits for a table at , in Bushwick get a mention too.,The video, made by bloggers who are hunting for great deals in Brooklyn, got over 25,000 hits in 6 days (whoa!).,I have grown fond of the gallery at the very end of the hallway at ,. , were founded in March 2011 by artist Tom Weinrich. Tom, who has a wood shop and a studio next door, has almost effordlessly put together noticeable art shows, one after another. The gallery space focuses on young, emerging artists and works to connect artists and ideas from across the country. Tom says he likes to give space to recent MFA graduates looking for community. In October, Tom gave the 1st solo show to ,, who got her MFA in Moving Image from University of Illinois at Chicago, and it was very successful. This strong video exhibition that investigated trust, presence and the deceptive nature by showing a detail of facial expression of people doing trust falls, was featured as critic’s pick in ,.,The sunny space of Interstate Projects changes its look radically with every new opening. On Friday night, I went to check out the most recent art show at Interstate Projects featuring Kevin Lips’ sculptures and Mason Saltarrelli’s works on paper. I was enchanted by the amorphous shapes of Lips’ sculptures that interact with each other and build off themselves. Saltarrelli’s work on paper feature mixture of images that were found and imagined. The works of both artists communicate together in a very interesting manner. Through color, and secret alliance of materials, perhaps….,The exhibition of the works by ,runs until February 25. Go, check it out, when coming from the Morgan L train stop.,A performance space on Starr Street appears quiet and inconspicuous from the outside. The presence of , is easy to ignore on the walk to from the Jefferson L stop.  Only its large Bushwick Starr banner, which is both intriguing and inviting, might lead you to “suspect” a performance and theater venue… I learned about it by word-of-mouth a few months ago. Reading up on the space online I was amazed by the quality of programming they’ve housed over the past year, featuring titles such as , and ,, two plays that were raved about by the New York Times. The venue even received the “Voices to Watch” award from the Alliance of Art last year.,But, The Starr has made the news recently by Premiering Nellie Tinder’s ,, lending the space a reputation as a Manhattan-class performance venue. Written and  directed  by Julia May Jonas  and  developed at the Starr, Evelyn mashes movement, music and text to present a parodic love letter to things past; a transient play featuring a chorus of women that examines the relationship of reality to artifice. Humorous and emotional, the viewer will step into the shoes of a mysterious community of women who struggle to differentiate between reality and mystics. The women’s thin sense of emotional security is further challenged when a luminous film star enters the facility, leading the women and viewers alike to discover why.,We can’t wait for the play to kick off- it premieres February 22, and runs through March 10,, and their calendar is booked through June with a litany of other promising performances. Currently, the venue is gearing up for its next show, ,, which opens this Wednesday. Check out the whole calendar and buy tickets at ,.,We have snow in Bushwick! ,! But also , because suddenly it feels like you want to stay inside where it’s warm, and nice. You want to bake cookies, catch up on movies and books or play with your lazy cat. But guys, brace yourself, and celebrate the fact that we live in Bushwick where creativity and good times grow on trees, indeed! Also this week there are a bunch of great events going on - but if you’re really lazy, at least do these 5 things because they are really awesome!,Have you been to ,?

DYI venue ,will feature a photography group show for every music fan. Go check it out on Friday night.,Friday at 6pm,,Free, ,Over 100 people gathered last night at ,, one of the newest galleries in Bushwick, for a talk about the nature and the future of the art scene in Bushwick. That the location of the panel discussion ,was the first “Bushwick gallery mall” was maybe a little symbolic for the subject matter of this talk…,The panel was hosted by the editor of a popular art blogazine ,, Hrag Vartanian, who as Peter Hopkins from The Bogart Salon pointed out “is no cheerleader of Bushwick, he’s rather a cricital observer.” Other panelists were Deborah Brown, artist and owner of , gallery; Thomas Burr Dodd, artist, owner and founder of ,; Carolina A. Miranda, art critic and culture writer for WNYC and Artnews; and Marco Antonini, Director of ,.,The panel discussion was very interesting and many resonating issues were raised by the panelists. It is also noteworthy that a parallel lively Twitter discussion was going on. The Twitter talk included the editor of ,, Paddy Johnson, , managing editor, James Panero, artist ,, Stephen Truax from ,,  and others. We were monitoring the debates both online and offline, and we are bringing you the most interesting points made through out the night.,Hrag lived in Bushwick between 2000 to 2008. He said that if you told someone in 2000 that Bushwick was the next thing, people would just laugh at you…,Carolina, whose big article about Bushwick is coming up in Artnews next week, spent 7 years in the neighborhood. She said that when she arrived, the only way to make connection with other artists was to spot someone with weird hair in a deli. She pointed out that art is an industry. While in 1968 there were 72 MFA programs in the country, today there is over 900… She said that Bushwick is actually the place where the entry level workers of art industry come to live. With the artists, the businesses come, which should be a good thing for the neighborhood, but often new businesses don’t hire locally, which creates tension. Carolina thinks that for people who came to Bushwick before the Blackout, its development is a good thing. They are welcoming a safer environment, new opportunities, etc. For people who came after the Blackout, it’s not so good. She said that whenever the locals see another U-Haul truck, they roll their eyes, because another Blanquito is coming, and the price of their rent, even the chicken in a bodega will go up.,Thomas, who runs Brooklyn Fire proof, rents 185,000 sq feet of property in Bushwick. He has been in the neighborhood for 9 years, and originally opened BK Fireproof as an art gallery in Williamsburg. He used to come to Bushwick to party. He said that there are many people around who don’t want to see Bushwick progress, because what many of us don’t know, Bushwick serves to Manhattan.  For example most of the garbage from Manhattan ends in Bushwick. There are people who don’t want this to change its industrial function.,Deborah Brown came in 2006 for the first time by accident, and 3 weeks later she owned a factory at Stockholm Street. Her intuition told her that Bushwick will be happening soon. Deborah said that she had witnessed big changes throughout the years, but the biggest changes have occurred within the last 6 months. Deborah thinks that 56 Bogart building is a manifestation of the art community, and that you can do anything in Bushwick. She co-founded a gallery, and is a member of the Community Board. Also, at the Community Board you get a completely different outlook on Bushwick; you get to learn who the leaders of the community are, you meet families, etc.,Deborah said that she has heard virtually nothing on the Community Board about the art community for years, and she has been the only one there and on her block, of her race and age…except for the last 6 months. Hers was a voice expressing anxiety and fear of the change. She said that it was the number of people coming recently to this neighborhood that triggered this anxiety.,Deborah said that the demographic composition of Bushwick is a lot more complicated that people think. There are many people of Latin descendant, but also many undocumented new immigrants.,Marco Antonini has never lived in Bushwick. Ironically when NURTUREart moved to Bushwick recently, he wanted to move here too to be closer to work, but he couldn’t find a place that he could afford. He lives in Clinton Hill.,He said that arts have always been a major factor of gentrification, and you can’t stop city from expanding. He, as the only European on the panel, said that what is being referred to as “community” is simply a class that differs by education, race and wealth.,Hrag makes a point that many galleries that moved from Williamsburg back to Manhattan did so because of the L train and its frequent repairs. The question is how much the L train influences Bushwick. We saw during Bushwick Open Studios 2011 when the L train was not running, that its impact could be significant. Other panelists seemed to agree with Hrag, and everyone was wondering what the hell MTA is always repairing there. “They could have had another tube by now,” Thomas said.,Deborah said that there are new galleries arriving in Bushwick that certainly want to do business. Like Stephanie Theodor, a gallery that is about to open at 56 Bogart.,Carolina thinks that Bushwick is a little in love with itself, because apartment art shows are something that has always happened in the beginning of a scene. However, this commercial wave can have a “parachute effect,” meaning that the art collectors from Luhring Augustine will go to the gallery, eat at Roberta’s afterwards and go back to Manhattan.,Hrag points out that this scene is more self-conscious.,Marco makes an interesting point that the critical mass in Bushwick is very self-sufficient, DYI. He sees the future in smaller commercial ventures. He thinks Bushwick has a pragmatic scene that will make sure to survive.,Hrag points out that this self-sufficiency might be also caused by the cuts in funding of arts, and that the artists had to learn how to be self-sufficient.,Thomas says that he sees a trend in Bushwick where the most of the artists realize that they probably won’t become world’s most famous painters. Instead they become mini-manufacturers with 1 or 2 employees creating their product, living a creative life. He says that every closed door in Bushwick is hiding something exciting happening. He sees a very entrepreneurial spirit in Bushwick.,Marco thinks we definitely are not, but that’s a problem with funding for arts everywhere in the world. However, it’s not automatic in other countries that artists have this entrepreneurial spirit, and that’s why the lack of support is sad.,Deborah thinks that because we vote, we can influence the allocation of funds.,Carolina says that it’s not easy to be creative when the housing prices are astronomical. That’s something that the Bloomberg administrative didn’t address very well…,Also there are huge poverty issues going on in Bushwick outside of the art world, that are more urgent and require attention.,Thomas expresses his frustration with the city. His businesses are always getting huge, unreasonable fines from inspectors. (“A fruit fly, $300.”) He says that the inspectors are squeezing money out of little businesses, and taxes are being raised even during the worst recession.,Just right. That’s how the bar at the corner of Wilson Ave and George St feels. , is a bar with no other ambition than to be your neighborhood bar where you go after work and chill. It has a rather conservative interior and the bar is made of hard wood. A large mirror above the bar makes the tiny place look optically bigger than it actually is. Whiskey bottles are nicely lined up, windows face the street, and an old fashioned juke box plays your favorite song. Every little object has a story and was carefully chosen by the husband and wife duo of the owners- Stevie Cain and Aaron Augenblick. Stevie has been a bartender for 17 years and Aaron has an animation studio in Dumbo. More than 6 months ago they made their year long dream come true and they opened a bar in Bushwick.,I stopped by at Cain’s Tavern to chat with the owners, curious about the history of the space, the ups and downs of running a business in Bushwick, and their vision….,Stevie: Yes, I am here at the daytime. I also bartend, but we have staff. We open at 3:30pm. I manage the day to day operation and have to be here anyway, so I might as well open the gates early.,Aaron: Stevie has been a bartender forever. Since we met, basically.,Stevie: 17 years in New York.,Aaron: This is definitely her world. She knows everything!,Stevie: Yeah… But you can never stop learning. You can never stop trying to get better. I have always wanted to do this, and I was finally ready also monetarily, because we did this all on our own. We don’t have partners; we didn’t take loans.,Aaron: We saved up money until the point when we were like: we can do this!,[quote]We used to live in the Lower East Side in the early ’90s, and Bushwick reminds us of that era. Bushwick has a lot of heart.[/quote],Aaron: We live in Fort Green, but we wanted to do this in Bushwick for a couple of reasons. We live nearby, and we would come over sometimes, and this place has such a great vibe.,Stevie: We used to live in the Lower East Side in the early ’90s, and Bushwick reminds us of that era. Bushwick has a lot of heart.,Aaron: It used to be really cool at the Lower East Side. Everyone was an artist or a musician. There was no pretention. It’s not like that anymore.,Stevie: Baby, it’s also 20 years later. We’re not 17 anymore [they are both laughing].,But it was also a good decision, because this neighborhood is going to blow up, and I want to be here when it happens. I want to have my roots here already. I want to be one of the first. Plus we have a lot of friends around.,Aaron: Yes, the people are really good, really creative…,Stevie: We also like other establishments in the area; we like that everyone is kinda doing their own thing. There is no competition. There is sense of community, which is really really important to me, because that’s the way I work. I don’t compete with people, I share…,[quote]This used to be a Puerto Rican speakeasy, a jazz club. And I’ve heard a rumour that it was owned by Tito Puente!![/quote],Aaron: It was a bodega before us. The bodega was pretty nasty. We had to completely cut it and start from scratch. I’ve talked to some of the local old-timers here, people that grew up here, and apparently a long time ago, this used to be a Puerto Rican speakeasy, a jazz club.  And I’ve heard a rumour that it was owned by Tito Puente!!,Stevie: When we pulled out this wall [she points at the wall behind the bar], there was a huge hand drawn map of Puerto Rico. It perhaps could have stayed, had the wall been structurally sound…. But we had to tear it down.,Aaron: The map was hand drawn using magic markers. There were palm trees and bikini girls…. It was pretty awesome.,Stevie: I couldn’t be more grateful for our customers and humble how much everyone has been good to us. Because when you’re coming to the new neighborhood you never know how people will receive you. You are betting on a fact that the people will like the same thing you like, which is a really raw thing.  You know, I’m a private person in a sense that I’m not up to be a billionaire, I’m not up to own a thousand bars, I don’t want to own a 2-storey club. I will die in this space… This is my baby… [they are both laughing…] My point is that I set out to create a neighborhood bar…. I just want people to come in, hang out, talk to other people, drink whiskey and listen to music. I just want them to be comfortable, and that’ it…,Aaron: Our goal was from the start to have…,Stevie and Aaron together [and we didn’t rehearse this , ]: …. a neighborhood bar.,Aaron: We didn’t try to create a large drink menu. We wanted to create a drinker’s bar. That’s what’s great about Bushwick- all the bars have their own vibe…,Stevie: The weekends are good, weeknights are really good too because most of the people that come here live around here. A ton of our customers live right up George Street.,Aaron: The weeknights are our locals’ nights.,Stevie: No matter what, anytime you walk in here, you will know somebody, if not the person behind the bar… You’ll always have a pleasant experience…,[mappress mapid=""7""],“Everything in Bushwick will change after this talk,” said Peter Hopkins regarding the talk , that is being hosted at ,. Peter Hopkins is the co-owner of one of the new galleries in Bushwick, The Bogart Salon, and additionally he curates the building at 56 Bogart. In case you haven’t heard yet, the huge yellow building across the street from the Morgan subway entrance, 56 Bogart is currently home to seven galleries, including two big art non-profits, Momenta Art and NURTUREart. Additionally,  more galleries are expected to move in pretty soon, including a Bushwick branch of a SoHo gallery, ,.,56 Bogart is something like a gallery mall, or a gallery arcade as Peter Hopkins likes to say. Its presence in Bushwick is bitter sweet. On one hand, it’s awesome that seven galleries can coordinate their openings and attract more people to come. On the other hand, it’s changing the game in Bushwick where most of the “old” galleries were DYI, artist run spaces, working mostly on a non-commercial basis. 56 Bogart attracts commercial gallerists from around the city. Also let’s not forget about Luhring Augustine, big fancy gallery from Chelsea, who are having their first opening in Bushwick on February 17 few blocks away., aspires to cover all these topics and more. The panel is hosted by Hrag Vartanian, editor of Hyperallergic. Other panelists are Deborah Brown, artist and owner of Storefront Bushwick gallery, Thomas Burr Dodd, artist, owner and founder of Brooklyn Fire Proof; Carolina A. Miranda, art critic and culture writer for WNYC and Artnews; and Marco Antonini, Director of NURTUREart.,The question is whether the panel is diverse enough to speak for the entire art scene in Bushwick. Several people pointed out that the panel doesn’t contain anyone from the original Bushwick gallery owners, only people who came to Bushwick just recently. Peter Hopkins objected that they wouldn’t accept the invitation for a panel discussion anyway. We can sense certain tension between the “old” and the “new” gallery owners in Bushwick… Peter Hopkins also said that he expects a lot from the discussion and that “It will be a dividing point. Bushwick 2.0 begins now.”,Bushwick is changing. That much we can state without any doubt. The question is how will the change be? Friendly? Natural? To the benefit of us all? Or drastic? Exclusionary? And eventually pushing the rents so high that the artists will leave?,Let’s see. About this and more, will be the discussion tonight from 6 to 9pm at The Bogart Salon at 56 Bogart. ,. Everyone will be there, and it will be heated!","

"A year and half of thoroughly deep research of the Bushwick art scene, which led us to:,Basically, that’s what it took us here at Bushwick Daily to make a decision to start ,.,We lovingly named it ,.,However, our aspirations weren’t to create just another regular Bushwick gallery; we were thrilled to create some alternative platform, something that hasn’t been explored yet… And since the Internet is our favorite kind of space, we decided to build a gallery online!,A gallery showing Bushwick art based on the Internet has many features that a physical gallery doesn’t, and we are eager to explore them.,An opening at an Internet gallery can allow so many more people to “attend” than an opening at a regular Bushwick space. On December 16, 2011 when we officially announced the launch of ,, we had over 900 people from 10 countries come see some gorgeous Bushwick art, which is a number that can be hardly beat by even the most popular physical art space in Bushwick.  Another big advantage is that our exhibitions are accessible to anyone in the world at any time. Not only during weekends or by an appointment. While stone-and-mortar Bushwick galleries have to rely on the L train, we only rely on the Internet.,Naturally, there are a bunch of awesome things about physical galleries. Like openings! Openings are wonderful! You can come out talk to the artists, curators, gallerists, and have fun! That is some non-virtual fun, as it should be. We couldn’t give this up. There is only as much fun you can have behind the screen of your computer. And while , is still a concept in progress, we decided that there will be an opening for every show at a different Bushwick location, and for a one night only the art will also be visible offline. Our current show Fantastic Four came online as part of Bushwick Daily Holiday Party at Paper Swan Loft.,All the art in , is for sale.  We are very open about our policies, and it is not a secret that 60% of the price goes to the artist; 40% goes to support existence of BushwickGallery.com and Bushwick Daily. So by buying art at BushwickGallery.com, you’re not only becoming collector, but you’re also supporting our existence.,We are selling originals, and where practical we are also offering prints! The prices are very Bushwick, starting at $100 for an original and $20 for a print. C’mon, that’s like a dinner and a drink in Bushwick.  Additionally, the prints are beautifully made by Bushwick-based fine art digital printing studio, ,.,Julie Torres, ,Our first art show titled , presents four brilliant Bushwick artists whose names could be used as synonyms of the word “Bushwick”  by now. We have previously featured all four of them here at Bushwick Daily in the Tuesday People series. , consists of , who despite his lovely personality created some dark latex faces; abstract painter and Bushwick restless organizator of amazing art events, ,; UFO and duck obsessed paitner ,;  and a cult figure of Brooklyn street art, ,!,Eric Trosko, ,will end on January 31, 2012, so if your heart desires art of these awesome folks, don’t hesitate and get it, because after January 31, we won’t sell it anymore.,Over Under, ,[button bg_color=""pink"" border=""black"" class=""http://bushwickgallery.com/buy/product-category/prints/""]Win A Print![/button],Now we’re giving away a print according to your own choice to 3 lucky Bushwick Daily readers who:,- Like Bushwick Gallery , , and/or,- Follow Bushwick Gallery ,,,- and leave a message/tweet on Bushwick Gallery’s wall, which art piece would the best fit your bedroom and why!,On January 30, we will select 3 best answers, and a print is all yours!,Nate Anspaugh, ,On a sad note… A fire on he first floor of a three-story building on Decatur Street in Bushwick shortly before 1:30 a.m. Sunday caused the death of a 7-year old Joel Smith. According to ,, 10 others were taken to the Woodhall hospital. That’s a dreadful tragedy. RIP, little Joel…,They say it was a cult, but to me it was a sci fi cult. And a lot of fun too…,On Sunday night, I cautiously walked down the dark stairs to the basement of a house at 70 Jefferson St. in Bushwick. That’s where , gallery is. Airplane is one of the newest galleries in Bushwick, opened in October 2011, and it’s run by artists Lars Kremenr, Liz Atzberger, and Kevin Curran.,I opened the door, and walked in. The neon light, basement esthetics, quirky art on the walls and on the floor, artist Julie Torres, wearing an army jumpsuit waving at me. I instantly thought of the hatch in the TV series ,, or about the sci fi movie ,. “Wow, pretty crazy,” I thought to myself. And that’s exactly what the four artists had in mind when they created a concept for the experimental art marathon and show called ,.,, ,, , and ,, met up at Airplane gallery on Friday midnight. Each of them being a unique individual artists with a distinctive work, they decided to create an installation throughout 3 days, and show it in a one night exhibition only. …and they chose cult as the theme.,I was really curious how did each of these artists play with the theme of cult. I could easily imagine Don Pedro Pablo or Ryan Ford creating some cult objects, but I was really curious about abstract painter Julie Torres or Liz Atzberger who uses bright materials a lot.,The results were really cool!,Ryan Ford created some kind of a weird altar balancing on pyramid with creepy eyes. On the altar there was a bunch of strange cult objects from a gold cassette to a cross. I suspect Ryan of being a really hyperactive artist who just can’t stop painting or sculpting quirky funny objects. Ryan also painted a wall.,Don Pablo Pedro created a praying corner where you could go down on your knees and pray to the crazy cult of weird figures with multiple eyes and limbs. I believe that a role of a cult leader suits Pedro really well.,Julie Torres made a wall using ropes, plastic bags and …her paintings. Really interesting shift in the works of this abstract cult member…. In addition she thoughtlessly collected  envelopes, paper bags and papers, pinned them onto a wall and painted spots on them…. This part of her work strongly reminded me of the current exhibition of , in 11 Gagosian galleries all around the world, showing, well, spot paintings. I inquired about a potential connection of cult logic and Damien Hirts, but she said the resemblance must be purely incidental. Right… ,Liz Atzberger is probably the tiniest of all the Bushwick artists, however after seeing her work, I believe she could start her own cult and be  the leader of it. Yup. She created an abstract cult object to pray on using multitude of materials and colors.,Btw, I was also lucky enough to catch a comedian duo Ross Moreno and Justin Cooper performing, doing lame magic tricks, and taking off their clothes…,A beginning of the end, or a beginning of a new beginning if you prefer… Last night , reported that Chelsea gallery Luhring Augustine, which has recently bought a warehouse at Knickerbocker Ave. and Ingram St. in Bushwick, has announced the date of their 1st opening in Bushwick.,On February 17, 2012 Luhring Augustine will present a solo exhibition of Charles Atlas titled ,. Atlas is a pioneering figure in film and video and has previously shown his work at Tate Modern, London; MoMA; the Centre Pompidou, Paris; the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston; Hamburger Bahnhof – Museum für Gegenwart, Berlin; and the Whitney Museum of American Art.,Luhring Augustine informs on their , that “The Illusion of Democracy will include two video installations never before seen in New York, Painting by Numbers, 2008 and Plato’s Alley, 2009. Atlas will also exhibit a new large-scale video work made specifically for this exhibition. ”,[quote]Some are welcoming the arrival of blue chip art collectors attached to Luhring Augustine hoping that the prestige of Bushwick art will increase. Others fear the instant rent increase in the area.[/quote],The arrival of a fancy Chelsea gallery to Bushwick, where the galleries are mostly artist-run and not commercially motivated, has been largely discussed on numerous art platforms (Hyperallergic, Art Fag City, Art Forum, WNYC, etc). Some of the Bushwick residents are welcoming the blue chip art collectors attached to Luhring Augustine hoping that the prestige of Bushwick art will increase.  Others fear that the presence of the Chelsea polish will instantly motivate the landlords to increase the rents in the area, and the artists will be subsequently pushed out of their homes.,[mappress mapid=""6""],It’s up to you which one of the Bushwick’s faces you choose to see everyday. You may choose to see galleries, trendy bars, poverty, dirty streets. Some Bushwick residents choose to see mystical and spiritual side of their every day life…,If you live in Bushwick, I am sure you have noticed a number of stores selling religious objects, amulets, candles and folklore medicine. They are called , and they are common in Hispanic countries, especially in the communities with ties to the Caribbean. Botanicas in Bushwick are not dedicated to one religion or belief nowadays, they are a “, mixing of various immigrant populations and religious traditions, bilingualism, assimilation, and the marketing of culture… “,

,I have been passing by a Botanica , on 1252 Myrtle Ave, which is around the corner of my house, for months. I’ve often been able to smell the incense burning in front of their door for the entire mile. I have seen altars with offerings of beer, whiskey, money or candy to a statue of Jesus, or a black saint. I have also recognized statues of Buddha, elephants, and other symbols typical for Hinduism, Buddhism and other eastern philosophies.,I was intrigued but a little bit intimidated, so it was only shortly after Halloween that I found the courage to come in. Elisabeth, a co-owner of the store who is originally from Haiti, smiled at me as I requested candles for good luck. She told me that I need seven tall colorful candles, but I bought only three of them. A pink Divino Nino Jesus, green Buena Suerte and blue Pisces astrology one. As she was adding drops of incense oil and glitter into each of the candles, Elisabeth casually mentioned that they just had a burning skull appear in the store. “Right above the burned spot where the man is repairing the floor,” she said. I looked and saw a worker removing burned floor between in the door, which connects the store with the back where Elisabeth reads tarot for her customers. She offered a reading, but I respectfully declined.,A couple of months went by before I visited Elias again. Yellow and blue scarves were hanging on the door as I entered. A pale yorkshire was standing in the door and he requested constant attention as I walked in, jumping as high as up to my waist. But when I tried to pet him, he bit me. Oh well… “Alex! Don’t be needy!” A young boy from Haiti behind the counter smiled at me. His canine teeth were long and pointed. I froze. But he turned out to be really nice, so I didn’t escape right away. He said that Elisabeth was giving a reading, and let me photograph the store while I waited. An elderly woman came out from the back and left the store. Shortly, Elisabeth invited me to the back and, despite not liking being photographed, she let me take a couple of pictures of her and we talked.,About 2 and half years ago. Before that I worked in another Botanica.,It is a religious store for people who practice mystic work, like Haitian voodoo or African magic. It is a Santeria for people who believe in miracles and that everything is possible.,No, it’s not just one religion, it’s universal. It is for people in this world who believe in what we are doing here rather than to what is being done in churches. I was myself raised as Catholic, but I chose what I do. Like everyone else has a choice to explore what they believe in, and to find out about other stuff that Albert Eistein and Aleister Crowley were talking about.,Most of what we do here is Haitian voodoo. We also practice African magic and formation of the laws. Laws mean the earthly souls. The souls that pass on, but still live within us… Most of this deal with roots. There can be different divisions of saints. For example this is Saint Baba [she points at a statue of a black female saint standing on the table]. She can have four different divisions.,We work with colors a lot. Each color has a different meaning, and signifies a different influence. If we want to achieve peace, calmness and purity, we use white. Red is life’s blood, and signifies passion. Pink is passion too. Green is for peace among family members and for earthly things like money. Yellow is radiance, color of the sun. Black is very controversial and a lot of people choose not to use black. But I like the color black. I also like purple. Purple means dignity.,I have been practicing a religion since I was 9, but I have been serious about this for about 7 years.,Three quarters of people here believe in what I do, and they have seen it work for themselves. They keep coming to me for more and more miracles, and to fix their pains in their private lives, especially their love lives, or to restore the peace in their families. They also come for financial blessings and prosperity and for spiritual cleansings. I do all these things, and it is my way of giving back. This is what I chose to do. It might not be what everyone likes, but this is my choice. When I’m gone, one of my kids will continue this tradition. This is my calling…,Yes, I have 21 different decks of cards. Each person likes a different deck and they chose which one they like the best.,No, it’s $21 per consultation. But it depends, because sometimes I let the spirits to come through me, and that costs more, because then the spirits possess me. I let in the ancestors, the relatives, who speak through me with other people, with their families. It’s really touching and emotional sometimes. People feel gratified and satisfied to hear from the dead.,You know, for the money I get, I buy offerings, food, flowers, whatever the saints like. The rest of the money is collected for the bills. I have to pay my bills, so that I can run my business and help people. So money is not as important, but it’s a necessity to keep the store open. If the customers don’t have money, it’s ok…,No, I don’t think that anyone can do this. I was born with a gift to see into the future. I have been able to predict a lot of things, since I’ve been doing this. A lot of people take it insignificantly, but what I predicted happens right in front of their face. Whenever I give readings to my customers, it’s accurate. If they don’t see it right away, they will see it within 2 or 3 days. I believe in myself; it’s a gift from God. I cherish the gift that I’ve been given and I will continue, although I there is a lot of controversy and a lot of people doubting… If the customers did not prove me, I would not be here.,I don’t classify myself as a psychic. I’m a medium that transforms information depending on what the interest of my customers is. I can’t explain it, but what I can say is that I will not condemn any psychic or medium, because they are certified in what they are doing. I have to support them, because I believe in this, and I live it everyday. Regarding other psychics, I don’t care, I’m me, I’m original, I’m unique, I’m different from everyone else. I’m not proud of it, but I’m thankful and humble…,The wind is knocked out of you. You can’t figure out if you’re so incredibly happy or so impossibly mad, and you’re confused how they can feel so similar. You might burst, explode, boil over, your face hurts from smiling, your gut hurts from crying, your throat hurts from screaming and laughing, you’re being stretched in two different directions but going the same way. You don’t know if you’re in heaven or in hell. Yet there is serenity.,This sounds intense, but they are the emotions conveyed in Bushwick artist Anna Pipe’s work on view at ,.  Leaning right over and above us as we started our interview was an image of a girl. She seems to blend into the painting, as if she’s being born from the paint. She tries to separate herself from the canvas she’s stuck to by leaning forward, laughing, emitting an almost manic smile. She is surrounded by bursts of color and energy forming from her abstract world. There is a feeling of both happiness and tension; you can almost hear both laughter and screams.,“The feeling I really wanted to show was a really saturated intensity of an energy,” said Anna of this piece, and others in the show, “almost to the point of overwhelming and threatening energy that is almost bubbling over, but it isn’t quite there yet. It could either be really beautiful or really terrifying.”,This contrast of beauty and terror give her visually stunning pieces an entirely different layer of depth. In a series of three red paintings for example, a sort of angel vs. devil vibe is happening. The paintings are of abstract red angles with faint gold veins running through them. They reminded me of a sort of fiery landscape, like a topographical map covered in lava. Yet one can make out faint figures lurking under thick swirls of red.,“Of course we’re all interested in humans. But I don’t like how with a portrait of someone, you know looking at a specific person, because you can’t really interpret as much, or you relate to it too much,” Anna said. “It doesn’t hide anything, so with these ones I like that you know it’s a human or some sort of entity but you can’t tie it down to a specific place or time, it becomes more ethereal.”,In the series, one figure, seemingly female, seems so at peace in her red world. She floats effortlessly, her soft otherworldly features barely distinguishable between the curves of the abstracted lines and shapes in the work. This painting’s counterpart however, is the exact opposite. She faces you head on. Her facial structure is angular, she appears to be fighting with the painting rather than enjoying her surroundings.,What adds a new layer of curiosity to Anna’s work as well, is that she paints from photographs. And not in the way one would thing. She doesn’t paint what’s in the photograph, but the object itself.,“I like the idea of painting the photograph instead of painting what’s in the photograph. It’s not trying to take the subject out of the picture and turning into something else, its painting an actual object,” Anna explained.,After hearing this, I looked up at the red pictures and thought…ok, what on earth (literally, what of this world!) could those be pictures of!  Anna explained to me that they were a happy accident that resulted from multiple occurrences like a wonky camera that picks up subtleties in a room, and a red lamp from the ’70s.,These successful images were a combination of unintentional events. Where as many of us go on camera walks or head out looking for amazing instagram photos to take, Anna thinks her next project will be painting found photographs. “I feel like if I go out and look for things to photograph it might be forced,” she mentioned.,I have seen some really cool, creative, beautiful and conceptual work as of late. But I haven’t “felt” a painting like this in a while. Most artists strive to achieve something more than a visual experience, and Anna’s works give you that almost instantly. If you can head over to North Williamsburg this weekend, I would highly recommend checking out her work before it gets taken down.,In Bushwick’s ,, I would see him every now and then.  With a serious face, , of Bushwick’s writers collective , would often read a thick book there, work on what appeared to be his debut novel or just stare at a ceiling in the most intellectual fashion. I would pass by, nod in order to greet the master but not to stir the invisible circles surrounding this young talented mind. “Oh, Morgan, Morgan, may your brilliance be blessed,” I would think to myself….,Now it’s obvious that my hopes for a masterpiece were fulfilled. Dolan was working on something tremendous, indeed! This young, talented writer created an ebook, nowadays available for purchase on , for only $2.99. [quote]Here are some absolutely useless reviews of completely meaningless (but wonderful) places in the world, accompanied by absolutely horrible illustrations[/quote]  … says the description of the ebook on amazon.,Naturally, I couldn’t miss out and rushed to purchase the said ebook. Soon enough, my kindle cloud was floating with many educational reviews of various google places that I don’t plan to go to. Nor does Dolan.,But wait that’s not the end of it. The best part is how Dolan handles the funds received from the sales of his lovely literary piece.  He throws them in vain in different places, takes picture of it and posts it ,.,Like the $2.99 from me ended up in a stream somewhere in ,. Look:,I can imagine what you’re thinking right now.  “What is it good for? Why should we let somebody else throw away our money?” But the truth is that it’s an extremely liberating feeling seeing your money go…. go somewhere far, while you are sitting with a laptop in your lap, just typing in your credit card digits to your browser. Isn’t it like something we all do always. You buy useless stuff online, and money goes… Well, try it and let me know how it felt…,There’s something brewing inside ,, a , that caught my attention, and it wasn’t a band.,Instead of filling the place with the usual music venue decor – posters, stickers and some graffiti – the owners decided to make the walls into a sort of living, breathing art project that’s continuously developing.,Maybe “living” and “breathing” were poor choices of words considering the subject matter…. On a wall in the space is a lone skeleton, standing from floor to ceiling, frozen in time as he somberly plays his guitar. His large hat hints to us that he was once a member of a mariachi band, now playing tunes from the grave. His bony fingers grip the guitar at sharp angles, yet he appears to be effortlessly stroking the strings. His bright white cartilage contrasts with the deep warm color behind him, the color of algae resting on a serene lake under a deep blue night sky. His whittled tree bark-like guitar perhaps carved from a piece of drift wood.,
,The piece called , is inspired by a combination of Mexico’s Day of the Dead and mariachi music, a theme Bushwick based artist and musician, Jeremey Aquilino has been drawn to and working with for quite some time. He often creates different groupings of skeletal mariachi men using his characters and sometimes bases them on real bands. That leaves me wondering which musicians inspired which?,“Last year I was living over in northern Bushwick close to Ridgewood, and my neighbors would always play Spanish music, and loud (he makes a bass reggae tone noise). It would just be everywhere, and I started painting this stuff last year in that apartment,” Jeremy said with a tone of possibly coming to a realization. “So it could have been influenced by that.”,What’s also cool about the piece is there is a the possibility to add more characters, so that the lone skeleton can maybe one day form his own band. This piece, along with additional paintings in the basement of neon aliens in a geometric patterned planet, are all evolving. The artists at Big Snow seem to take pride in the fact that they never actually consider their work finished.,“It might stay as is or it might change over the next few months,” Jeremy looking up at the skeleton with adoration and skepticism, “I like to look at all my artwork as unfinished. It leaves me the option of adding, who knows,” Jeremy said.,
,“I kind of like the constant art that’s been developing in this place,” Jeremy said, “like over there, that happened last night” he points to a drawing pasted up on a mirror, a scene of a grumpy old woman scowling at the venue that was drawn by someone working the door during a show at the venue the night before.,This music venue is charming; I imagine it didn’t set out to become an art space. But to me, with the well-crafted stylized paintings along with the cool transformative and collaborative working styles, it seems like a great creative environment where inspiration and artist collaboration kind of drips from the walls. That defines an art space, right? So if you’re going to check out your favorite band at Big Snow, look around, you might see something different each time.,Dear Bushwick! Good news! We made it to 2012! May this year be even more awesome and artsy than ,!,
,
,The first day of 2012 was sunny and windy. The streets were messy from the loud celebration last night, and most of the Bushwick residents sought a refuge in some good Bushwick brunch place.  Tens of art fans were circulating between two places, , and ,k, where art joined forces with lovely food, coffee and mimosas. Yes, that’s how 2012 began in Bushwick….,Newly re-opened , welcomed its visitors with colorful geometric art  from Gary Petersen, Halsey Hathaway and Rob De Oude.

"Year 2011 was colorful and eventful. Looking back at our 2011 photography posts, one has to be nostalgic…. So many great events, parties, music, art, good people…. Do you remember how Bogart Street looked like after the January snow storm? Did you go to both Beat Nites? Have you enjoyed Bushwick Open Studios and Site Fest?  Oh sweet memories… Check out for yourself…., is currently hosting ,as its guest exhibitor this month for a project titled, “Here I am: Bushwick in the 1980s.” As an art instructor who taught in the neighborhood, following the historic fires and riots of the Seventies, Meisler captured the destruction she witnessed first-hand—derelict buildings, apartment lootings and a feeling of desertion. But she also grasped something beautiful and unspoken. Beyond all of this terrible decay, life continued. The community was stronger than its walls. Her images show neighbors picnicking besides ramshackle cars and girls playing jump rope beside graffiti-covered homes. “People are still together and still having a laugh amidst this garbage and nonsense,” said Randolph Osmyn Beers, one of Meisler’s former art students, who visited the gallery opening night.,I headed over to one of Bushwick’s newest venues called ,to check out one of my recent obsessions, ,, who played with , and , on Friday, 2 weeks ago. The three local bands were harmonious on the same bill- all shared elements of drone, psychadelia, and scattered percussion. It was great to finally see Big Snow- a venue that’s been raved about recently- in its Friday night glory. The crowd was subdued- a mixture of beer-drinking wallflowers, enthusiastic musicians and listeners who wore their coats inside, ladies with cat-eye makeup, and those three stoned guys who never left the couch made for an intimate crowd setting.,Besides the surprisingly great (and only slightly deafening) sound quality in the front room, the best thing about this venue are the coated brick walls- crawling with an array of paintings. Upstairs and in the basement, there are a handful of different artists working together to give the walls new life. More images of those murals below.,The show started out with ,, a Brooklyn trio who name drop the Zen Theorizer, and play loud and loopy psychedelic garage songs . While facing away from the audience for most of their set (stylistic choice, or were the visualizers too much?), they were well received for their brief but passionate set. Though there’s not much to be gleamed about them online, my friend Jenn over at altered zones , and described their sound as “channel[ing] alien airwaves through a microwave oven attached to a bus.” Listen to the mp3 below and hear that radiation through your headphones.,, with the most terribly vague but somehow apt name, was a a treasure upon first listen. One man, crooning with eyes closed into filtered mic, with lots of loops pedals and a lovely acoustic guitar, makes reverb and surf pop come together in a uplfting way. 60s influenced, drone interpreted, ambient like waves crashing upon a shore… all in all very pretty. Look out for this guy, I think he’s Panda Bear’s cousin or something… and ,, his album S/T is up for free download., , as one of the best bands I saw at CMJ, and was aurally rewarded seeing them again, in a much less stressful showcase. They played in their element, pacing their psychedelic delves for just the right instances and taking their time arriving at climactic jam points. These dudes bring a mystical sound to their garage ambience- blending animal-collective-feels-era experimental vocal tinges and majestic guitars atop layered ambient drone jams, their sound hit the right levels in Big Snow’s intimate front room. I walked away with a vinyl and have been spinning it ever since.,Saying that , is a band to keep an eye on in the coming year would probably be an understatement and, based on the buzz they’ve been generating (as a favorite at CMJ and in profiles by ,, , and ,), it feels like a syllogism at this point. I caught their set at the Music Hall of Williamsburg on Friday where  they debuted two new tracks, opening for Deleted Scenes and Bear Hands.  And it was boldly jaw-dropping in a very why-haven’t-I-heard-this-before  way.,A five piece electro-rock/pop anthem machine with roots in Williamsburg  and Bushwick, Fort Lean puts out a strikingly mature sound for a new  band with just a four-track EP to their name.Though the scale of the venue represented new terrain for them, they performed less like a band crossing into uncharted territory than like a home-team late in the season. This tight performance presence mixed with the maturity of their compositions and the blow-your-hair-back intensity of front-man Keenan Mitchell’s vocals was like Clint Eastwood’s appearance in a local saloon at the beginning of a ,-type Western: Very hard not to pay attention to.,At first glance the gritty juke-box feel of their refreshingly straight forward tunes nearly overshadows the complexity of their musicianship, but it quickly becomes clear that all five band members contribute more or less equally to the sound and are comfortable wearing multiple hats. Guitarist Zach Fried and keyboardist Will Runge both provide significant vocals and Runge spends about half the show with a guitar in hand. This multi-faceted showmanship reads as a further ace up these guys’ rather crowded sleeves: there were moments when I found myself watching Fried’s impressive fretwork (and footwork for that matter) only to realize that it was Mitchell taking the solo.,
Of course, if all that didn’t leave a lasting impression Mr. Mitchell provided a K.O. punch by peeling back his lip to show us a bloody gash while he described how being jumped in an elevator for his rolling tobacco formed the inspiration for one of their new tunes.,
The takeaway: this already strong band is full of surprises, improving steadily, ready for more and here to stay. Fort Lean’s upcoming release on Neon Gold is out in February. Until then you’ll have to catch them live to hear what they’ve been up to lately, which, based on their performance, has been a hell of a lot and well worth our attention.,Those are only a couple of many many happy cheers we heard about , last Friday at ,! And we couldn’t agree more! The party was simply amazing! We celebrated in the loving home atmosphere of Paper Swan Loft with amazing writers reading, tremendous bands playing and lovely art hanging, in the company of friends and the dear ones.,Writers ,, , and , read their stories, with background sounds and music, inspired by Paul Rome’s reading performances. The effect of such reading was tremendous, and the entire audience was instantly transported from Paper Swan loft to Budapest where Zuska Kepplova’s character was waking up in the middle of the night to the sound of sirens and experiencing a lesbian encounter after a recent break up; or to a Bushwick home restaurant where the ladies of Maria Modrovich are selling not only delicious dinners; or a Bushwick intersection where Paul Rome’s character unsuccessfully makes a move on a girl.,In the dim light of Christmas lights, 3 amazing bands played acoustic music causing our hearts to melt. We danced, drunk and talked while ,, , and The Vagabond Bailsmen played amazing music.,Above that all, amazing art pieces on the wall from Nate Anspaugh, Julie Torres and Eric Trosko were perfectioning the atmosphere dearly. Amazing art came offline for one night only from the 1st Internet-based gallery in Bushwick, ,.,Thanks again to all who came and chipped in with their nice energy to the overall lovely atmosphere! But most of all, thank you to Paper Swan collective, who shared their home with us!

The medical students behind Wyckoff Wednesdays invited us to check out their bi-weekly program at the ,, which services NYC seniors over the ages of 60.,The morning began with a routine screening of blood pressure and blood glucose levels. Students practiced their basic clinical skills and talked to seniors about high-risk conditions like diabetes and hypertension. After the screening, they had lunch and played bingo or pool.,At 1 p.m., once the last of the seniors were cared for, everyone gathered in the cafeteria. The deejay dived right into the first song and every able-bodied person, with the exception of yours truly, grabbed someone and began dancing.,Med student and event organizer Simarpreet Kaur told us that she always encourages her male peers to volunteer some of their time on Wednesday afternoons. “The ladies, they love the guys,” she said, laughing. The students were equally enthusiastic. They volunteered to be there, after all.,We just want to say kudos to the student council at the Wyckoff Heights Medical Center for putting together such a functional and enjoyable service for our seniors.

This year the lucky ones are: Claudia Alessi, LaThoriel Badenhausen, Charlotte Becket, Catherine Cullen, Gordon Fearey, Robert Gould, Leslie Kerby, Alexis Neider, Julie Torres and James Whitman. Come for talks and fun!,Free BYOB/F (food) event. ,.,A fellow Bushwick resident,  ,, was lucky and talented enough to be selected as one of the Virgens in Karen O’s , This music/art/theater performance piece, or a “Psycho Opera” if you want, took place at , this past fall. An ethereal and dramatic tribute to love, loss, the future and memory, the opera unfolded like a dream, floating from one scene to the next among sweeping musical numbers and dynamic stage visuals- oh, and terrific costume changes.,The project was a monumental accumulation of almost 10 years of work on Karen’s part. Karen, who’s best known for ,‘ cult status as a art punk band, actually studied film in college. When she first wrote the songs for the musical about 7 years ago, she originally saw what came to be Stop the Virgens as a series of short films or vignettes. In that time of period, she wrote the songs in a stream-of-conciousness process that amounted to the soundtrack of the show. Through her work with co-creator of the show, KK Barrett, who’s done set production on Spike Jonze and Sophia Coppola films, and collaborations with other visual producers, the psycho opera came about. The production was raved about, by audience members, press, and everyone in the show itself, including Nadia Hulett. So I sat down with Nadia, who gave me insights into the performance piece and Karen O’s legendary status as a creator…,[quote]Karen came out and said basically, “The only way I know how to thank you is by singing to you.” Then the YYYs started performing for us, starting with Maps and going through some of their singles. It was amazing.[/quote],We were called Virgin acolytes- We were a body of girls, we created the world that the audience entered into. We were like a maze of bodies, helping people find their way into the theater. We also created a soundscape throughout the show, being a chorus. Everything from the show came from Karen’s head, her experiences- as a group, we were important to the show by being extensions of her vision.,We were dressed like young choir girls…in white costumes and wigs. We were instructed to portray ourselves as ferel girls, otherwordly, not quite human. We were all told to all embody the same character, and we we all performed in the same way, but, Karen was humbled by the diversity in skills we all brought, from musical theater girls and all the experience we brought.,She’s really nice, she’s kooky, she’s brilliant. She’s internalizes a lot, but when she performs she’s wild. There’s a switch in her that she just turns on when she performs, it’s amazing.,I always hoped I would, but i didn’t expect this to happen so quickly. It was so fast- heard about it a few days before, auditioned, found out a few days later. We rehearsed for a few weeks, put it up for a few weeks and then… it was done. I hoped and knew that something like this would happen.,Not only musicians, but artists, directors, etc that are so talented and passionate, and I guess I looked at all of them and thought “Why not me?” .  There was this focus that came about to keep shooting for such cool things. To keep working hard and find these kinds of people near me to collaborate in the future.,The other members of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs- Nick Zinner, Brian Chase- plus up to 10 other people were performing at all times. The drummer and the bassist were both members of , and , . The cellist is one of the co-founders of (venue in the west village) Le Poisson Rouge, too.,Nick [Zinner] had his camera all the time with him taking photos of the entire experience. They’re not for public display. I think he’s not sure what to do with them. But they’re out there.,One night before the show closed, they wanted to thank everyone in the production in a special way and they called us as if we were gonna have a meeting and gave us some Bud Lights and Coronas and Karen came out and said basically, “The only way I know how to thank you is by singing to you.” Then the YYYs started performing for us, starting with , and going through some of their singles. It was amazing. It went back to me being a small part of the chorus, and it wasn’t just me that was moved, everyone was so moved. There was this excitement and fear and vulnerability that we were really united by.,Anybody else sometimes feels like Bushwick is getting too polished with all these new brunch places and luxurious condos being built? Anybody misses the old timey rough Bushwick of 1974? [Full-of-it allert , ] Look at this NBC News reportage from about teenage gang , that used to operate in the infamous ,. The video made by NBC, contains a lot of footage shot with a concealed camera “with a special night vision lens” [aw!].  It captures a regular night of  The Devil’s Rebels in Bushwick getting drunk, some casual gang member stabbing, and a subsequent confrontation with the cops. It is noteworthy that the cops are being pretty rough as well- kicking a gang member’s ass, threatening to kill Wally Savage, and tossing a bike…,Regardless of everything, I have to admit that there is something romanticly adventurous about the video as well. It’s probably the era to blame and the 70s gang fashion….,The tone of the reporter is very educational. Here are some of my favorite quotes from the video:","

": Teddy Sczudlo,: Yoga Teacher,: In the very fashion of a spiritual gangster, he throws jokes between complicated asanas.,: Because of his sunshine personality, and because he teaches an amazingly spriritual yoga with a sense of humor.,: text him at (202) 400 8074 and he will keep you updated on the classes.,: Every Monday and Wednesday at 7:30pm at Opera House, 27 Arian Pl., Bushwick.,***,Ridiculously cheerful Christmas song is blasting from the speaker in a dimly lit dance studio at Opera House, Bushwick. Teddy Sczudlo, the yoga teacher, is laughing, clearly amused by his own choice of music to finish the yoga practice today.,The class is laughing with Teddy, as they are rolling their yoga mats and putting their socks back on.  There is something uplifting, deeply moving and relaxing in the air.  I can’t help myself but lovingly smile at everyone else. The switch in my head happened in the middle of the class, when I opened my eyes after an asana. The air suddenly seemed clear and crisp, and I felt enormous energy in my heart. Teddy probably saw the pleasant confusion on my face and he said laughing: “It’s working, right?”,Teddy puts on his sweatshirt that says ,, and admires how the common area in the basement of Opera House has cleared out ever since we started to practice yoga in the dance studio: “Before there was always someone getting wasted and partying. Not anymore…”,Teddy, who is a fine art photographer by day, started to flirt with yoga when he was 18. It got him. Totally. Later, his ways lead him to ,, an American teacher of Tibetan Buddhism, who was the 1st Westerner to qualify for the , degree at Sera monastery at India. Geshe Michael Roach became Teddy’s teacher, who also introduced him to Lady Niguma Yoga. After Teddy spend a year and a half in Hongkong teaching Lady Niguma, he now teaches it in Bushwick. This kind of yoga involves intensive work with all six chakras, and a lot of single pointed meditation. The results are breathtaking…,According to Teddy every New York neighborhood attracts a different kind of people. He likes that people in Bushwick are highly artistic and risky. Teddy comes to Opera House patiently twice a week regardless of the number of students that shows up. Sometimes it’s one, sometimes it’s nine. Teddy doesn’t seem to make any difference, and keeps teaching with the same level of enthusiasm. While Lady Niguma Yoga is highly spiritual, Teddy throws a joke here and there, and gives a lot of thought to the music selection. As a result, yoga the way he teaches it, is a lot of fun.,We met up for a photo shoot, nowhere else than at the Opera House. Teddy showed up in the very fashion of a spiritual gangster: in a fedora hat holding a meditation book wrapped in a red fabric.  “Try holding the book, it has an amazing energy,” says Teddy smiling. He offered a couple of acrobatic postures for the photos, and we climb up the roof despite his vertigo.,“Yoga and art are synonyms to me,” he said while climbing the stairs…,There’s an alley alongside the , Gallery in Bushwick that is both welcoming and foreboding. If you’re not used to the somewhat desolate and industrial area, it shines like a sign that says “walk over here and you’re going the right way.” It’s foreboding in that it looks like a passageway out of Law & Order: SVU. There’s a fence on its last legs, broken glass and a forgotten tire every now and then. , took the space and made it as welcoming as a carnival, a bright and happy coat of paint and cast of characters stand on a wall to amuse you and tell you a story.,A cast of characters happily guide you down the alley. Snakes swirling around cracks in the wall, smiling cowboys riding bullets, pink elephants blowing steam at cigar smoking mustached men, colorful houses, boats, teddy bears, crocodiles, skeletons and musical instruments all come to life, interacting with each other down a long brick wall. It’s as if these creations are all mingling with each other down a long corridor of a frat party.,The fact that the bright colors make the alley a much happier place did not happen by chance.,“Lots of street art is dark and moody.” Jim said to me in a German accent over the phone. And while he admits that some of his characters may have a dark side, he likes to juxtapose their actions with multiple bright colors. “So maybe that’s my idea of life. Like you always get the mix of the nice and the not so nice, the good and the bad, and I want to reflect that in my work.”,His “ideas of life” can be attributed to his education at what he calls ”the school of life.” Having no art school experience, Jim attributes his characters’ personalities and style — German expressionism from the 20th century meeting American cartoon  and pop art — to being an observant artist.,“I really like watching people in the subway on the train, on the street, I think every face tells a story so I like to read in between the lines, simplify the face and see how far I can simplify it to show some character, some mood, and out of the intention to reduce comes the comic characters.”,While Jim doesn’t usually paint such large murals outside, he said every now and then he gets the craving to fulfill a large project like this. The size and scope of the piece is overwhelming and, if you walk up close enough to it, it’s almost like you’ve entered another world. While this world in part comes from his observations and creative mind, he also attributes them to his experience as a foreigner in the U.S. When he first came to New York, he imagined that it would be pretty similar to the city of Berlin. “But after a while,” he clarified, “you find out there are a lot of differences in the mentality. I tried to make a panorama and let all of these aspects of mentality become like characters that appear on the panorama.”,It is considered an honor to transform the wall on Factory Fresh’s side street, and Jim seemed to be aware of the great opportunity he was presented with, for even in the past he has always gravitated toward street art’s rebellious qualities in regards to the “art world” and the fact that it is “not made for selling, but displaying and showing,” he said.,While in general Jim’s characters are relateable and fun to look at, the best part about the mural is ,the fact that it is vivid and colorful plays tricks with your mind, making the viewer think twice about the relationship between the mood that often goes with these bright colors juxtaposed with what is actually going on.,You can check out the mural on Vandervoort Place on view until 2012.,Living in the fabulous town of Bushwick, frequently requires a superb orientation in the music and cultural whereabouts; because as we are happy to observe, the event organization flourishes in our hood. Altough, with so many awesome events, it can sometimes be quite a challenge to pick the best ones to attend. So forget about the Facabook invitations mayhem, and check out our top 5 Bushwick events for this week!,Big Snow Buffalo Lodge is a brand new show space/recording studio in Bushwick! Its location in the industrial part of Bushwick at 89 Varet St, makes it perfect for late night dancing ventures with the music bands that will be huge tomorrow.,
Come on Thursday at  8pm to check out Wishes & Thieves/ Life Size Maps/ Osekre & The Lucky Bastards/ Shark?,Artist Rebecca Litt is curating an interesting art show featuring some of our most favorite artists from the hood. Rebecca assigned the artists to read a story , by Steven Millhauser. The artists have worked with emotions of anticipation, ephemeral experience, and paralyzing anxiety present in the story.,On Wednesday at 7:30pm, go do something for your not only body, but also soul. Teddy Sczudlo is teaching ,that will unlock your chakras and bring you closer to enlightenment. The class is donation-based.,Come to 27 Arion Pl, Bushwick.,319 Scholes is an awesome geeky art space in Bushwick focusing on new media, internet and other non-physical art. , is their bimonthly music and performance event.

Joe Balweg has surrendered his friendly studio space to a pop up, self-curated art show. Expect  a bunch of awesome artists, awesome fun in Ridgewood, and DIY in the best possible sense.,… and if you didn’t have enough, check out our events listings in the sidebar —>, is a Bushwick-based collective of musicians, producers, filmmakers and artists, and a source of many great ideas! These awesome guys have organized several music events in their Bushwick loft, including the famous , earlier this year; and a series of 9 music nights at Union Hall, the finale of which is taking place this Wednesday. [Paper Swan will conclude the series with a free concert starting at 8pm! More info ,.],Now Paper Swan is coming with their newest project – an ambitious idea of their own social network called ,.  Swan City will provide a platform for artists in and around Brooklyn to connect, and to share music, videos, photos, drawings, stories, poems, blog posts, links etc.,Because I had approximately 2,845 questions about how exactly they want to do it, and what they want to achieve with Swan City in the times of Facebook, I asked our pal ,from Paper Swan a couple of question.,We wanted Swan City to feel like a meeting place where artists can share their work freely. We realized that if we make it easy for people, then we’d be able to give our friends a loud voice on a small social network in a social media-frenzied world where everyone’s talking at once.,Eventually everyone! But for now, we’re asking our friends and all the people we’ve worked with over the years. We’re adding a couple users a week, so we’ll see where that takes us.,Sure there are giant social networking sites, but that doesn’t mean that there isn’t room for smaller sites with a niche. But we still use those resources to connect to a much greater pool of people, which is important as well.,We want to connect as many people as possible, and we want to feature great work from great artists. Swan City will be an ongoing dialogue that will also help to capture this fine moment in time. There are some really creative people who are contributing, and Swan City will help them share their work and connect to each other. We also want to be able to show our support for our friends’ projects, which is a big part of our mission statement.,That would be really cool! But we don’t know how to do that, and we have no money to pay anyone ,  [Bushwick Daily: Hint for you technical readers! Help Swan City if you can! , ],For us, Swan City is a way to keep up with all the friends we’ve made over the years. We’ve been fortunate enough to work with some amazing artists, and we want those people to know that once you’re in the Paper Swan family, you’re in for good! So it’s nice when our friends drop in and say hello, even if only on our website. But at least we know what they’re up to, and we get to support them and help them share their work, which we’re happy to do ,Not yet, but I’m sure Bushwick Daily could make a lot! ,Are you looking for a bakery to buy Thanksgiving pastry? Well, look no more! Right here in our beloved town of Bushwick, on the corner of Knickerbocker and Hart, we have the most amazing old-fashioned Italian bakery!,It was shortly before hurriccane Irene threatened to destroy the city when I told to myself: “If I were to die, I wanna have some cookies before,” and found myself walking into this classy establishment. Well, Irene didn’t destroy much in New York, but the cookies from Circo’s Pastry Shop hit me hard!,This time shortly before Thanksgiving, I walked in again. The sweet smell is heavenly; people who work there are sweet too; and the pastry is nothing less than absolutely amazing. Circo’s has been around since 1945, and is known for its legendary cannolis. So if you don’t have a Thanksgiving cake yet, go and commit some pastry sin!,When I first met Brad Henderson, he was poking at a piece from , at Bushwick gallery ,. My heart started pounding. What is this guy doing? He poked and poked away, his eyes an inch from the work, jabbing and sliding and jabbing and sliding with his index ginger. Finally and awkwardly I approached him and kind of just blurted out “What are you doing?!” It turned out, as he later put it, he was “playing a painting.”,’s show at Factory Fresh is a mix of vibrant and muted paintings on the walls, sprinkled with brightly colored sculptures of Tetris games or pieces with “limbs” sticking out of them. But one main noticeable theme strewn about in the works is that the word “vs” adorns them. Many of Ryan’s paintings use a “vs.” format, where he pits his inventive characters against each other, like in an old school combat style video game. After living on Ryan’s couch for a while, former college roommate and friend Brad decided he wanted to “play the painting.” Brad’s experience is in digital art, and was inspired by the frozen action and movement in Ryan’s flat paintings and inventive characters.,The pair began on their journey to turn the works into interactive games. The first game the two developed was ,, based off Ford’s painting of the same name. In this game a giant tarantula shoots deadly lasers out of his eyes at a large chainsaw wielding rabbit tries to chop it up.,, as it turns out, was the game I watched Brad playing at Factory Fresh, thinking he was poking at a painting. This game features the cloud eater eating clouds that are being shot out by the box. The two are working on another much more NSFW game based off of the painting titled (ahem) ,.  In this game, naked women on horses pleasure themselves to move ahead. The goal is to reach a climax without getting bumped by the police cars chasing them.,As we reminisced about the days of Atari and Nintendo, Ryan mused that the companies probably had no idea of the impact they would one day have in the art world, citing digital artist , (responsible for the famous piece ,) and metal bands that have turned things like the Super Mario Brother’s theme song into metal ballads.,Ryan and Brad’s collaboration couldn’t make more sense. Ryan paints a fantasy world of characters frozen in action and time, and Brad brings them to life.,“It was full circle,” Ryan said. “I had thought about them being video games, but I was the painter being inspired by video games and taking layouts from specific style fighting games, and then Brad comes in actually wanting to turn them into games.”,“I think our process is different because we start with a painting first. Ryan makes a still image of the game in action, and from there we riff off of it and move forward, I think that makes it different,” Brad added.,Next up for the two is to develop a series of apps to help fund their latest projects and get some exposure for their paintings. This graced the question of commercial products as art.,The apps will also help them from turning into “walking zombies,” Ryan said, naming the problem many can relate to having a boring day job to fund their latest projects. And is it worth someone struggling working 2 or 3 jobs as a waiter or a freelancer or even a stock broker when all they want to do is act, paint, write or sing? Brad answered my question and finished the interview on an optimistic note:,“Sometimes it’s very painful, trying to get things out in the world, but what makes it worth it is – what I do is like writing a novel in a way, and there will be a moment where it will just come to life, and you’ll just laugh because it’s kind of amazing. It’s those moments that make it worth it, when there’s this magic that happens on the screen.”,Be on the lookout out for these two. I think the crossover between digital and painterly art is one that has yet to be really explored, and the pairs’ Warholian concepts of high and low art, and commercial products and art is being shown in an updated and relevant way to our generation. I would not be surprised to hear of their success.,Oliver Ralli likes to get his coffee at ,. He never sits inside; he prefers to occupy one of the chairs in front of the café, observing the autumn Bushwick when the color of things gets saturated and the air is crisp.,It’s year 2011, and a lot has changed in the life of the singer of a cult Bushwick band, ,, since he came to New York City in 1997.  “I never got tired of the City,” he says. We met up in front of Wycoff Starr, naturally. Oliver finished his coffee while I locked my bike. Adam, Oliver’s year-long friend and Pass Kontrol’s co-founder, who was just working his shift at the coffee shop came out to say hi. “This is what I love about this place. All the people you meet here,” Oliver smiles.,“I got keys from The Bushwick Starr. Another favorite place of mine,” Oliver says joyfully. Pass Kontrol used to rehearse at Bushwick’s experimental theater located in a huge loft. Last year in February, the band presented an apocalyptic play titled ,there, which was a huge success. The play was very loose, “ragtag,” as Oliver says.,Oliver and I bike down Flushing Ave; we’re passing the factories, trucks parked on the side of the road, and the rest of the industrial wasteland. Suddenly, a white farm with a huge green yard emerges on our right side. The fairy tale-like house hits us like a miracle. “ ,,” another place favorite place of Oliver. Four dogs bark at us, pretending to be mad to fulfill their guardian duty. They turn into lovable puppies as soon as we’re let in. The atmosphere of the Victorian house is magical. Oliver greets everyone. Pass Kontrol rehearses in the attic of the house several times a week.  “This is a very special place for me. Jessica and I got married here three years ago,” Oliver smiles about the unexpected discovery of romance in the industrial corner between Bushwick and Ridgewood.,Another favorite location Oliver wants to take me to is his home at Gates Avenue, Ridgewood.  The basement of the house is also the home to a famous gallery, ,. Ellen Letcher, one of the founders is Oliver’s neighbor and a friend. Oliver says that on the 11th of September 2011, he wanted to take a flight to his home Chicago from JFK airport. Due to the circumstances we all know, the flight was cancelled, and Oliver was forced to return to New York. “I just took random buses, because the subway was shut down too,” says Oliver. Somehow he made it to Ridgewood. That was his first time there. He remembers a strange, good feeling. A couple of years after, Oliver was living his life in Ridgewood. Good, rich life, full of love and good people.,While there is no end to my love for Bushwick, I have to admit a , lately. While Bushwick is sweet in its industrial tenderness, Ridgewood is like a time travel to an old timey hometown. The increasing number of artists and art spaces moving up north to Ridgewood is even more of a reason to go and show some love to our neighbors…,After the more famous, ,, two new galleries found their home in Ridgewood- , and ,. Moreover, the galleries are only a walking distance from each other, and both had openings on the Friday night.,Small Black Door is a gallery behind a small black door (unsurprisingly), in the basement of a Ridgewood town house. The space has a friendly feng shuei, and the co-founders Matthew Mahler and Jonathan Terranova, who are both artists, did a great job in bringing the community together. The reception at Small Black Door felt like the gallery has been around forever, and the party was great! The gallery presented ,, a collection of drawings that make you chuckle. The curator Matthew F. Fisher said he had the idea for a long time.,Over at Valentine, Fred Valentine, proud of his beautiful space, presented a solo show of Andrew Moszynski who focuses in his works ,. How adorable!,When the openings came to an end, we all, under the lead of the Ridgewood’s local Matthew Mahler, headed to , beer hall at Fairview Ave. Did you know that Ridgewood was , by Germans and Italians? Well, Gottscheer is an evidence of Ridgwood history; it is an old fashion German beer garten with green table cloths, bratwurst, and cheap tasty beer. We loved the old photographs on the walls- a 70s athletic team; several decades of winners of Gottscheer miss pageant competition; a jukebox; the ballroom prepared for a sweet 16 party (ocean themed)….,A couple of regulars were pretty shocked by the art crowd that suddenly emerged at their pub at first, but I think that we coexisted nicely at the end. We were all drawn by a mutual intention after all – to have fun or ,.,: ,: ,Today is the International Day of Giving Back! The initiative No Impact has partnered up with The Green Streets Initiative to organize the the first ,. The idea of the project is to encourage New Yorkers to use green methods of transportation  such as bikes, walking, public transit, but also unicycles, carpooling, skateboarding, etc.  Good news that the Walk/Ride day in NYC has teamed up with local businesses who will provide sweet deals for those who participate and ,.,You can find the list of businesses who pledged to provide deals ,. In Bushwick, it is cafe ,. So don’t forget to wear green when you are getting your coffee today.,: ,: All day November 18th, 2011, 7 pm-Meet-up.,: The streets/subways/buses of NYC, 7 pm @ Luca Bar: 119 Saint Marks Pl # 2, New,York, NY 10009.  ,will be providing discounts!,: The No Impact Project and the Green Streets Initiative.,Hello again runners and Bushwickians. So I’ve ventured out for another running excursion with camera in-hand to bring you this photo essay, fresh off the streets. Along the way this time, I even encountered some people I knew and many smells I did not care to. Here’s a rundown:,I started my jaunt along Bogart Street where I came upon ,, a mobile public green space inside of a trailer. A lovely idea; though it needed a watering.,If you’re into street art, check out Meserole and Waterbury, where IDC, a Chicago-based collective has done some cool work.,Note the Shepard Fairey in the reflection here too.,Then, when I got to Varick and Harrison, whom should I see but my own tailor extraordinaire, Arthur Arbit and my favorite furry puffball, Tinkerbell. Arthur is a Bushwick hero; artist, costumer, DJ and the genius behind , The man knows how to craft any piece of clothing and his breadth of musical knowledge is staggering.,Until recently, I was unaware that Bushwick really had an art store but , has sort of a satellite supply shop @ Gardener and Johnson. It’s tiny but they can order stuff if you call ahead.,Next, after lots more street art and what I like to think of as the Bushwick Highline, I veared off-course and up Troutman to stop by the , woodshop to say hello and do some hammering and sawing. They’re getting ready for the winter so there’s greenhouses to make and chicken coops to shore up.,Stop by on a Thursday afternoon and Vinny will be building something cool. And can always use a helping hand or a donation.,By the time I got home, the sun was setting. All in all, a nice little run around the hood.,[cetsEmbedGmap src=http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=212311646485465385880.0004b1d50ccc500db26c6&msa=0&ll=40.705628,-73.929169&spn=0.013761,0.02178 width=590 height=380 marginwidth=0 marginheight=0 frameborder=0 scrolling=no]","

" is not shutting down! We connot be happier that , about Storefront shutting down turned out to be inaccurate! One of the Bushwick’s most significant galleries will remain on the Bushwick art map also in 2012!,Storefront’s co-founder , informed us that the space just renewed the lease agreement at its current location 16 Wilson Ave, Bushwick. The gallery  will close down for couple of weeks on December 18, and will resume its activities under the solo lead of Deborah Brown and with a new name ‘Storefront Bushwick’ in the new year. The 1st art show of Storefront Bushwick in 2012 will feature the works of Gary Petersen and Halsey Hathaway in the front gallery and paintings by Rob de Oude in the back room. However, on December 9, the gallery will host Opening/Closing party presenting works of Deborah Brown, Hermine Ford, Suzanne Goldenberg, Cooper Holoweski, Andrew Hurst, Norman Jabaut, Mary Judge, Greg Kwiatek, Justen Ladda, Amy Lincoln, Kevin Regan, and Austin Thomas. Don’t miss it!,Storefront was co-founded in 2009 by important Bushwick figures artist Deborah Brown and curator Jason Andrew, and have been , in bringing the attention of the art world to Bushwick.,: James George,: Media artist and programmer,: Smiling geeky artist who is not afraid to smash his iPhone to measure the duration 0f the free fall.,: Because of his open source endeavors, and because through complicated programing language he can speak and please the mind of everyone.,: ,: ,That’s one thoroughly smashed iPhone.” I’m looking at the iPhone at James George’s desk. Media artist and programmer James has just moved into his brand new studio at 56 Bogart. When he invited me to check out his newest projects and awesome new space in Bushwick, I couldn’t have been more excited. Last time James and I spoke, he was leaving to spend his summer in London to work with a collective of multimedia artists on a permanent audio-visual installation , at ,.,In the video from the installation James is showing me, thousands of words collected through interviews with different people about sea are being projected in wave-like movement.,“That’s the only phone that got smashed during the , competition,” James is laughing. Free Fall Highscore is a smart phone application that measures the time, during which your phone is experiencing a free fall. The longer, the better. James He presented the Free Fall Highschore app at the , in DUMBO in October.  The bad news is that Apple rejected the application from the App Store with the explanation that Free Fall Highscore is dangerous. The application is now available only to, users and to the owners of jailbroken iPhones through Cyndia. “You know, I had always been a fan of Apple, but now I actually think Android is cooler, ” James explains. James says that Free Fall Highscore makes you challenge your materialism; it makes you put the beloved expensive toy in danger, and be creative about it. Free Fall Highscore team has organized a “phone drop ” competition recently. The task was to create a smart phone preserver so that it survives a fall from the roof of McKibbin lofts. The competitors were truly creative and came up with all kinds of different preservers from a flowerpot (who won, yay!) to a giant sock monkey. You can watch the videos from the contest ,. All the preservers were exhibited at the Creators Project.,White light is radiated from three screens on the desk while James is explaining how the programmers’ community works. The community is using ,, an open source C++ toolkit for creative programming.  James explains that even tough the community creates an open source code, they are is extremely busy to publish it at one spot once they are finished. That’s why it used to be problematic to find previously created code. “It used to be a little bit like folklore.  The information about projects was spread through the word of mouth.” That’s why James and his friend , created a website called ,. The website searches through the Internet for the created code and automatically publishes it there. The community simply finds what has been created before on one spot. “Open source is great. You can use what someone else has created, but at the same time you feel a moral obligation to make your code public,” says James. As a result, the progress in programming is faster and greater.,It took , no time at all to display what makes him tick when I met up with him in a café in Williamsburg. Before I could even see him take a marker out of his pocket, he had already begun sketching caricatures of the people in the café in each segment of the spread out napkin.  They were wearing big headphones, most were on laptops or plugged into something, and their simple eyes made from large circles looked up at us from the page…er….cloth.,“I’m intrigued, I’m intrigued by the people that are here,” he said, a simple answer that explains a lot in his work.,The UK expat creates murals, apparel, drawings, music, paintings and much more, mostly consisting of flat cartoon or comic like characters. Sometimes they’re bright and colorful, other times they are completely born of a pen, existing only in thick black lines. Some of them seem to resemble people, animals, fruits or other figures found in nature, but are entirely of their own world.,“If you draw a little thing with a face, it’s not a character in my mind. A character is when it starts to have a personality, it has a back story, you know, it has dreams and desires and goals and something it aims for,” Burgerman said.,He went on to describe that although it isn’t very possible to pinpoint exactly where these characters and their environments come from, perhaps there can be some attribution to childhood favorites like Tex Avery and Warner Brother’s Cartoons, as well as a British comic book involving the character “Beano,” who he described as the British Dennis the Menace.,Burgerman liked these characters and stories specifically for the fact that they were unlike super hero comics. There are not many adult themes of cities, cars, muscles, danger, revenge and desire or dramatic images of flowing capes, bulging biceps and leotards in these comics and cartoons. But what they did provide was an existence of their own world with their own rules.,“They’re completely bizarre but they make sense within in their own terms,” he said, sighting the instances of a character running off a cliff, standing in midair for a moment, and then falling. “That’s completely accepted. I like to think or hope that across the work that I make, it’s not as literal as hat but there is a kind of Burgerman world or a world of my work where it can all sit together.”,Drawing and painting isn’t all the artist is up to these days. He was also excited to speak of his band, ,. The band came from an idea his friend and fellow character artist Jim Avignon had, about creating a sort of art band. Burgerman learned to play the ukulele for the band, and Anxieteam seemed to become both a nice change of pace yet point of inspiration from painting and drawing. He explained that if you’re lucky enough to make a living doing what you love, unfortunately what you love becomes work. So what do you do in your free time? Enter, Anxieteam.,The band has a great influence in his artwork and vice versa.,“What I try and do is treat the making of songs the same way I would treat the making of art or drawings so the topics and ideas for songs and titles of songs could easily be a tie off for paintings and exhibitions, and I don’t see them as separate things. I see them as — I’m a person and I make stuff, and that stuff could be apparel, it could be digital, it could be made out of acrylic paint, it could be made out of pencil it could be a song or a rhyme, it could be just text, but they’re all in the same world which I created around myself so, why not music?”,You can check out Anxieteam this Wednesday the 16th at , in Greenpoint.,I first met Burgerman standing in the middle of his latest work, “The Garden of Eden, Bushwick” at , in Bushwick. On three walls of the gallery’s courtyard, we see images that have human features but are certainly not recognizable as our own, all colorful and overlapping within this lush looking atmosphere juxtaposed against Bushwick’s gritty industrial surfaces. We see animals, insects, fruits and a large scale Adam, absent of his Eve. This mural shows a different style from Burgerman, not as neat or finely drawn as we are used to seeing from him.  The painting style is a bit more rough and strokey, and he revealed that he only used brushes for this piece, no spray cans or pens. However there is no denying it’s a Burgerman creation. We still see whimsical and monsterish personalities lining the walls, all with bright colors. Being that almost all of the 4 walls are painted, it’s like for a moment you can live in Burgerman’s head, in his world.,So what motivates him to keep creating this universe?,“People always ask, so when did you start drawing, and I think that’s such a silly question because all kids draw, sine you could hold a pen, parents give kids crayons. Some people stop and other people keep going I guess”,A slew of European shows will whisk Jon Burgerman away come the new year. So you can see one of his last pieces of the year go up this weekend at Artitst Ally @ Extra place, Saturday the 19, at 2pm, where he’ll be painting a mural on the floor.,We are live-tweeting from the closing of , at ,: comments on the happening, review of the art in making and encouraging a dialogue in the virtual space. Tweets using #BogartSalon are being projected on the wall at The Bogart Salon and displayed on Bushwick Daily.,Local writers collective , organized a successful book swap benefit at , on Saturday, Nov. 5. The goal of the swap was to collect and donate books to prisoners in collaboration with the Lower East Side-based charity organization ,.,1441 was founded in January of this year. The group currently has eight members, all of whom publish and perform regularly. They meet and workshop each other’s work regularly but have been looking for a way to branch out and work with and for their community.,“We, as a collective, talked about doing an event that wasn’t a reading and that was reaching out to the community and was trying to brand our collective as the force behind the literary scene in Bushwick,” says member ,.,Eric’s past volunteer work at ,, the Books Through Bars headquarters, allowed 1441 to easily coordinate with the organization, but he also says that the collective did not just choose to run with what was easy and accessible.,“We know that what they’re doing is very important on a large scale. It’s benefiting prisoners and promoting literacy among the incarcerated population,” Eric explains. “A lot of the judicial system has been noted through panels and academic sources as largely slanted against the poor.”,Participants were able to choose one book in exchange for every two of their own. Dictionaries, a commonly requested item by prisoners, could be relinquished for one drink ticket. Roughly 100 books were packed away at the end of the night. About 60 paperbacks were shipped to Books Through Bars the following day. The remaining books, all hardcovers, could not be sent because of high shipping costs and were instead donated to the ,.,For future events hosted by 1441, make sure to check the collective’s ,.,: Closing of the 1st salon, ,: ,, 56 Bogart St., Morgan, L train,: ,: Friday, November 11, 2011, 6-9pm,: big party with art supplies, drinks, and a big projection of tweets #BogartSalon,: Naked models are still in!,Have you been to 56 Bogart yet? Yes, that’s that huge yellow industrial building right across the street from Morgan, L train station. This Friday might be a good day to check out the new gallery arcade! 56 Bogart is a home to 6, soon to be 7 galleries. One of our favorite art spaces, ,, has finally made a big move from their location at Grand St., and will feature ,, in the building on Friday too.,Besides NURTUREart, you should not miss a closing at The Bogart Salon. This newbie to Bushwick art scene will feature the last of the series of salons, titled ,. The thing is that The Bogart Salon isn’t a typical gallery. Peter Hopkins of The Bogart Salon told me that they plan to organize a salon as every other show. “The regular shows will fund the salons,” he said. Peter also told me that nowadays the artists work separately from each other in a studio and he isn’t a big fan of this concept. Instead of the artistic solitude, he prefers the 19th century salons. Artists used to create in a common room; they would discuss, party, and inspire each other. Peter is now trying to revive this old-fashioned vehicle and fill it with a new media form….,The reference point for the salon is a famous painting by Édouard Manet, , or The Luncheon on the Grass. The Bogart Salon has recreated the painting with models and a piece of grass in the middle of the room. Since the opening of the salon 5 weeks ago, different artists have been coming in to talk and create their vision inspired by the painting in all kinds of media. The walls at The Bogart Salon are now almost covered with different pieces of art from drawings, graphic images, to photographs. There is even a claymation inspired by Manet’s painting…,One last art salon featuring the nude models, drinks, a lot of art supplies waiting for you to be used, is taking place this Friday from 6 to 9pm. The Bogart Salon is inviting everyone to come and take a part. Peter Hopkins says they are trying to provoke the interchange of traditional roles in art: artist, critic, collector. Even the models are encouraged to get involved in the creative process.,Peter Hopkins says that new is actually never new, we simply just stopped trying. He approached me as a local blogger to take a part at the last ,salon, and I gladly accepted. I will be live-tweeting from The Bogart Salon, commenting on the happening, reviewing the art in making and encouraging a dialogue in the virtual space of Twitter with the people at the closing but also around the world. Every tweet using the hashtag , will be projected on the wall, and additionally we will be displaying the Twitter feed on our website, here at Bushwick Daily., reported today that , plans to shut down Central Ave and Knickerbocker Ave, M train stations. The stations will be one after another closed for about half a year. MTA plans to rehabilitate these two rusty stations.  The entire mezzanines will be demolished, reports the website.,Knickerbocker will first close in the late spring of 2012, and will be shut down for 5 months. Once Knickerbocker is completed, the works on Central will begin.,For those of us who have gotten used to convenient M train, it’s pretty bad. However, MTA promised to increase the B54 bus service.  BTW have you ever taken a bus in Bushwick? It is a , interesting experience…,[mappress mapid=""2""], Outfit Party!, Saturday, November 12, 2012, 3-6pm, Sue’s Vintage Boutique at the corner of Flushing Ave and Bogart St, FREE mimosas, pure girl fun, and lovely Sue!,: ,It was about this time of year last fall when I discovered ,. Sue, an incredibly interesting and adorable lady from Thailand, sold amazingly stylish and cute dresses in a remodeled garage on Central Avenue in Bushwick. I was stunned to discover designer brands, such as Chanel, Prada and Valentino, for as little as $15.,Over the past year, Sue and I became friends and I never neglected to visit her in the store whenever I saw it open. Sue has been a resident of Bushwick for more than 30 years and she has a bunch of interesting stories about the neighborhood in the old days. She would treat me to a chocolate milk or tea and always asked if I was doing all right, if I wasn’t too broke, and if I was seeing someone nice. She would always be very honest about how I looked in a particular piece of clothing, and so the clothes I bought at Sue’s Vintage Boutique are some of my favorites.,Recently, I went to Sue’s with my roommate Zuska to find out that she had moved her boutique around the corner to Flushing Ave and her new space is even cuter that the previous one. She recently visited her family in Bangkok, and was very excited to bring back more cute clothes, mostly vintage designer brands, to sell in the store. She told me that she was just getting ready to unpack the Fall/Winter clothes, and I couldn’t be more excited. It was the first time my roommate Zuska had visited Sue’s store and, naturally, she loved it. We spent the afternoon playing like little girls digging through their grandma’s closet, trying on different outfits, and having tons of fun. Madonna look? Argentinean president’s widow? Frankie Goes to Hollywood, the female version? We tried it all…,I suggested to Sue that she have an outfit try-on party at her store on Saturday, and she loved the idea! We are now inviting all the Bushwick Daily girls to Sue’s Vintage Boutique at the corner of Flushing and Bogart St., right off Morgan L train stop, from 3pm to 6pm to play with us. Sue will be serving free mimosas and playing jazz on her old-fashioned stereo. So don’t miss out and come to say hi to Sue!,Continue for more photos!,This year’s College Music Journal Music Festival- aka ,- is a whirlwind of ,, ,, ,, ,and ,. I crusied through the festival, mostly going to unofficial shows (,, Fader Fort, KCRW, Anti-CMJ House parties, etc), and wound up seeing an unexpectedly diverse array of amazing bands. After a much thinking, here are ,(in no particular order), including an Mp3 from each! Spoiler altert: Doldrums, Zambri, Delicate Steve…,, of Montreal, doesn’t only pull a name reference from Ariel Pink’s classic album, he also encorporates some of those weird L.A. retro-pop vibes, throws them in a glitch-blender, adds a solid drum machine a little bit of sped-up indie sunshowers. Fun to listen to and a pleasure to see live, Doldrums have toured with , and are currently backing ,, so expect to see great things on the horizon., hit me hard with their uncategorizable, experimental, thoroughly enjoyable sound. To label this band is so difficult- from one song to the next they jump from instrumental Hendrix-inspired guitar songs to tropical jam melodies with tenderly mumbled vocals. Not to mention the huge array of instruments they used onstage. They recently toured with ,, who I find to be their closest musical associates with a diverse, raw, and always evolving sound. Delicate Steve produces more youthful, more unpredictable, more balanced, and less canned songs that are breathtaking and whimsical. Really a fantastic band, and a completely enveloping live performance.,Canadians and up-and-comers ,hail from modern-day Montreal but musically seems not from this time. Bizarre minimal melodies, a deep and booming voice, and the occasional surf guitar picking make their live show surprisingly enthralling. On headphones, the music feels personal and lonely- earnest vocals with goth undertones- seeming like a custom-made mixtape., does the Brooklyn electronic duo pretty flawlessly. Switching from drums to keys but constantly manning their pedals and mic, their sound is a form of dream pop- dramatic and intricate, but still very accesible. Their live show kills people with fun, and their fanbase likes to go wild.,By far the sexiest group I saw at CMJ is,, an electronic Brooklyn duo of experimental-gypsy ladies that look like they could be sisters. Sisters that make your heart beat quick and your ears hurt so good. Their music resembles a gothic Kate Bush.  Having an abraisive quality that is tangibly pleasurable live, for once the level of sensuality and talent balances the scales.,- This underrated Brooklyn band kinda blew my mind. They are very detailed-oriented instrumentally, not sacrificing any extra sounds for an unnecessarily noisey effect, and their vocals are heavy and sensual.  Sometimes bright synths add a suspenseful element, other times the band vibes a more alternative sound. This band is certainly enigmatic, and I’d have them no other way.,, where to begin- this is where saxophones and crossdressing meet in a musically awesome way. These guys are hipster hippies- maybe by that I just mean another ” Brooklyn art collective”- their genre-spanning music promotes simple messages of love and encouragement, while their live show comes bundled in jackets tied together in Christmas lights, a crowd dance circle, hand painted signs, and costumes for everyone in the crowd. The most fun and interactive show I saw all CMJ., love you guys, ,. “To listen is to fall into a cathartic, emotional listening experience. They blend melodic, fall-off-the-bone tender vocals with organic rhythms.” Blah, blah, blah…. but listen to the MP3 and tell me it isn’t true!,, with dual drummers, far-off poetic vocals and atomsopheric jam sound, is probably my favorite new band I discovered at CMJ. A Brooklyn-via-Denver band, rural undertones carry through their songs. There’s a “freak folk” element to their music- they take risks encorporating less-than-poppy sound samples – but the organic nature of the loops makes even the extraterrestrial sound bytes feel right in place. Can’t wait to see them again when their set isn’t cut short by CMJ’s set-sandwiching.,Florida’s , perfects a smooth type of chillwave that’s more suited for a beach party than a blacklight club- and that’s a good thing. With cresendoing keyboard melodies and familiar beats, his vocals glide atop lush, oceanic, feelgood rhythms. Performing alone and closing out the night I saw him at Pianos, he had everyone dancing to his mellow-but-evervescent tunes.,WAAAAY MORE PICS (of all the bands) OVER , Abel Macias,Fine art painter who sometimes turns into a street artist, in the memory of good ol’ days before his arrest.,Wheat-pasted yellow bunnies and spray-painted pink stormy clouds, Abel is an optimistic hedonist, whose world is beautiful and has more colors than the worlds of the most of us.,Yellow bunnies. Or the pink storm cloud.,I can’t decide which one of Abel’s signature pieces of art I like better. Yellow bunnies have taken over the outer walls of my favorite Bushwick café, ,. But seeing a pink storm cloud sprayed on the wall at the corner of Flushing and Central Avenues means I am almost done with my daily run through Bushwick.,Since a couple of weeks ago, Little Skips surrendered a large part of their inside and outside space to the art of Abel Macias. I like being able to see the yellow bunnies from the M train when it’s arriving to the Myrtle/Broadway station.,The pink storm cloud sprayed on the wall in Abel’s Bushwick studio is brighter than the one on the corner of Flushing and Central. Abel Macias, a Bushwick resident for about three years, says that it must be his Mexican origins that influence his choice of palette. “I love Mexico and its colorful culture so much! Its iconography inspires a lot,” says Abel. Abel grew up in Atlanta but his both parents come from Guadalajara and he loves to visit his family still living there.,Abel Macias lives and works in an awesome house at Willoughby Avenue. His studio is in the basement and his and his roommate’s, bedrooms are on the ground floor. They have remodeled their house, and I can’t stop admiring it. Abel’s house is definitely one of the best places in Bushwick I have visited so far. They have a huge open space living room, full of interesting artifacts. There is a sewing machine, where his roommate makes clothes and jewelry for Brooklyn Flea and Etsy. Abel’s lazy dog is sleeping in his bed.,Abel’s art is similar to his easygoing and optimistic nature. “Life is Good,” says one of his pieces. The letters are surrounded by pink floating scoops of ice cream.,While I admire Abel’s fine art pieces hanging in his studio and in Little Skips, I feel like Abel is too playful to stay locked inside, and would appreciate taking his art out in the streets. “How do you feel about street art, Abel?” I ask him. “I like it, but Brooklyn jail is no joke,” Abel says. Ever since his arrest due to street art about a year ago, Abel has been making street art only when permitted. He was arrested in Bushwick on a cold snowy night for spraying a pink cloud on a wall, he says. “I had just gotten out of the Jefferson subway stop. No one was around but sure enough, as soon as I was about to finish a piece an undercover cop car pulls up,” Abel says sadly. Abel adds that he fully cooperated with the cop but was treated like shit anyhow. He spent 24 hours in a crowded cell in a Downtown Brooklyn jail. “I think it’s rather unfortunate how street artists get treated so harshly by the local police. They get unjustly punished and grouped with criminals that really do endanger society,” Abel says.","

": 107 Himrod St.,: Gladys and Julio Franco-Colon,: Robby Franco-Colon and extended family,In a place like Bushwick, with its industrial landscape and lack of greenery, a little cheery lighting and merry spirit can go a long way. Gladys and Julio Franco-Colon of 107 Himrod St. have maintained this outlook for the 13 years they’ve lived here. Their son Robby, dressed year-round as an angel, only makes the process more enjoyable for them, they tell me.,We briefly discussed the family’s early years of Bushwick living. Those early years were tough, Gladys told me. This, of course, comes as no surprise to anyone familiar with the neighborhood’s history of violence and drugs. The house is one of several on the block that has a lawn, an atypical addition around here, and is still equipped with a heavy fence that needs to be locked from the inside and outside. Trick-or-treating, treated today as an activity to be carried out with extreme caution (or not at all) by overbearing parents everywhere, was considered truly unwise in Bushwick over a decade ago. Gladys is happy that things have since changed for the better.,But we didn’t dwell on the past so much. We quickly moved on to other more current, lighthearted topics – decoration placement, photography, and Robby’s singing abilities.,Check out the slideshow below. (You’ll wonder how I kept from pinching Robby’s cheeks off.),Halloween weekend in Bushwick started on Friday night in a very artsy fashion! , presented our most favorite gallery walk, ,!,It is my pleasure to state that there are so many amazing galleries in Bushwick, that it’s getting harder and harder to check them all in one night.

Take a look at our photo essay, mapping the best moments of the night!,Click to enlarge the image!,The autumn is a fan of Bushwick. The colors are brighter, the air is crisp, and the shadows are sooo long.

This is what I got on my camera…,After less than a year, another edition , is coming up this Friday in Bushwick! Beat Nite is the world’s most amazing and fun gallery walk in Bushwick, and you should not miss it. Looking at our , from the last Beat Nite in February 2011, I have to say that a lot has changed in art Bushwick… For better, that is for sure.

I am personally the most curious about Ashley Zelinskie’s  survey on technology’s influence in art , a group show “All Your Art Are Belong to Us.”,Over at Storefront they are opening an exhibition featuring paintings and ceramics called Color Schemes. One of our favorite artists, painter Brooke Moyse is in the show, which means that art awesomness is inevitable.,Norte Maar is not only organizing amazing Beat Nite, but they will also have a new show featuring sound sculptures by ,.

Go check out the gallery turned into the birthing station. Additionally, the exhibition now features the video and other renmnants from the birth., 464 Seneca Ave,Leave the territory of Bushwick, and check out also Rigdewood.

They have an amazing exhibition called Separation going on. Check out the works of Rob de Oude, and how far can straight geometrical lines take you.,The most watched for and expected child of 2011, ,, was born today in our beloved town of Bushwick. (We wrote about the performance piece ,.) Performance artist Marni Kotak gave birth today at 10.17am in , to a beautiful and healthy baby boy. The baby weights 9 lbs 2 ounces and is 21 inches tall.,Marni experienced this unforgettable moment surrounded by a small group of family members, friends, and a handful of randomly chosen participants. I was one of the lucky ones attending, and the atmosphere in the gallery was magical.  I believe that all of the participants were deeply moved by this emotional, raw and true ‘piece of art’.  I feel like the entire audience accomplished this together with Marni, using the commonly created positive energy.  Everyone was also very helpful.,Great news is that Microscope announced that they are taking part in the popular gallery walk in Bushwick, , this Friday, and will stay open until 10pm. In addition to the current exhibition, the remnants from the birth along with a video of birth will be added. The exhibition will continue until November 7.,Keep up with Marni and her Baby X, and like Bushwick Daily on , is an awesome new band referred to as the ”,” by the British ,. Great news is that they have a new video for their song ,, and even better news is that they chose Bushwick for the location of filming. Enjoy!,Just in case CMJ hasn’t slapped you in the face enough, tonight is also ,‘s official launching fundraiser, with drinks, t-shirts, and bands. First of all, we photography lovers at Bushwick Daily are beyond excited to have this incredible resource at our disposal. The darkroom, which is a private, one-room do-it-all space is Bushwick’s first affordable printing facility… and best of all, it’s affordable! I spoke with the owner of the darkroom, Lucia Rollow, briefly about it.,Lucia studied photography at SVA and had been working in the darkroom since she was 13. Disheartened by the fact that black-and-white printing is an art that’s slowly dying out commercially, she put her efforts after graduating into making a communal space where old school printers could continue working on their own time and not feel intimidated.,The Darkroom is located in BushBurg, the owners of which also own the loom, that modern office-building looking space near Troutman and Irving. Lucia lives and works doing art out of her apartment and has set up the darkroom in the basement, although one of the purposes of the fundraiser is to move into a larger space! During Bushwick Open Studios I got to check out a small but awesome photography show in the hallway of the building. Lucia says they plan to do more shows in the future, especially featuring work of people who use the community darkroom.,Just for fun I asked Lucia for her favorite spots around Bushwick and she said she loved the Bushwick Starr, which has briefly opens its sleepy doors during CMJ for a handful of shows. She also loves Shea Stadium, which is where the fundraiser will take place TONIGHT. We can’t wait for this darkroom to really take off, and I will be doing a write-up and show-and-tell of one day’s work in the darkroom sometime in the future to show everyone how great the results will be (at least I hope so- I grew up in the darkroom, too, but haven’t printed anything really for a few months!!) Hope to see EVERYONE at the fundraiser tonight.,Bushwick Community  Darkroom Fundraiser, Shea Stadium , 20 meadow street 1st floor Brooklyn NY 11206, Grand st L stop, Raising money to get a larger space.

There were a dozen or so interactive art installations, and a high-profile music component featuring headliners Justice, Florence + The Machine, Four Tet, Atlas Sound and more.,Art installations featured a stunning geometric light cube (the focal point of the festival’s public space installation) by the United Artists as well as beautiful and intricate light bending reflective sculptures from SOFTlab called “r&Dazzle.”  Video projects were galore, including a David Bowie-Mick Rock-Barney Clay film, “Life on Mars Revisited,” and collaborative video work from Animal Collective and Black Dice called “Jumbletron.” Interactive pieces included “MED ITATION”  by Minha Yan, a reactive light installation that observers could control through movement and “A PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION OF  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE ARE FLOATING IN SPACE,” (by Jonathan Glazer + J. Spaceman) sound and light room created for the purpose of hearing different elements of sound as specific to pools of light.,The Music portion of the fest surpassed the art segment as far as big names and prestige went. The festival featured three different stages and some really incredible headliners- from digital geniuses Justice to pop superstar Florence + The Machine, subdued and intricate Four Tet, and my personal favorite one-man sound factory Bradford Cox aka Atlas Sound. Also featured were John Maus, Girl Unit, Teen Daze, Yuksek and Queen Sea Big Shark. Justice’s DJ Set (that I considered an actual performance as they were sampling their own work) was mind-blowing, taking place in an old Tobacco Factory, an outdoor brickyard that was overflowing with fans. Too bad the NYPD cut the show in half, demanding the show be shut down due to noise complaints.,Of course, the biggest event of the whole festival is the buzzed-about Stop The Virgens psych-opera written by Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs at St. Ann’s Warehouse. I got to go to the dress rehearsal of the show and adored the music, costumes, and stage presence of the entire cast. The show still has a few dates, feel free to check out more info on the show ,.,…do you know what you are doing this weekend? I surely know what , and 13 other artists will be doing… They will all be part of an insane art experiment ,, during which they will be creating artwork, sleeping, and finally having a party!,Participating artists will meet up in , (722 Metropolitan Ave. Second Floor, Brooklyn) on ,, at midnight. They will be creating art work for the following 24 hours straight (!!!). After this creative insanity, they will have time to rest for 12 hours, i.e. from midnight on Saturday to noon on Sunday. On Sunday at noon to midnight, the doors of Camel Art Space will be open, and everyone is welcomed to take look at the artwork created during the experiment, and to join the creative bunch celebrating the last third of 48 HRS!,Here, take a look at this helpful timetable of 48 HRS:,Don’t despair! Thanks to , you can also witness the first 36 hours of the experiment. Look for hashtag , or simply come to the ,. We will be displaying every tweet containing hashtag #48HRS throughout the entire experiment. The artists will be tweeting and posting pictures right from the site.,Also Bushwick Daily’s Katarina Hybenova, will be photographing and videotaping the entire process. In regular intervals, some photographs will appear on Bushwick Daily, and in the end the photo and the video documentation will be exhibited as part of the art show!,Artist Julie Torres is a big fan of painting marathons and the mastermind behind 48HRS. Julie has herself undergone several “mini” painting marathons, and a 24 hour-long one, which took place at the headquarters of popular ,. We asked her what to expect., first introduced me to painting marathons, which she began doing about a year ago with her friend, ,. I’ve also done a bunch with ,. And yes- I love them! Thank you, Geddes!, me to push myself. I tend to paint for long periods, but working in such a focused way with another person is much more intense. And also, you sort of absorb what the other person is doing. Last time with Geddes, she was drawing these bees- and next thing you know- I’ve got these black and yellow stripes going through my piece (see photo.) That sharing of energy and experience thrills me.,The longest I’ve gone with Geddes is 15 hours. We were pretty fried at the end. But she’s gone 24-hours straight with Annie, so I know that it’s possible! I’ve painted for 15 hours on my own, but there’s something different about hunkering down in one room with another person. When I work from home I take breaks, check email, make a phone call, etc– but this experience is different. It’s very concentrated. So yeah- that’s the longest I’ve gone, 9 hours short of the goal! But it helps.,That’s a tough one. I don’t know that it’s up to me to say what a viewers’ role is, but I do have some ideas about enhancing interaction with people who come to the show. I can’t wait. I won’t give it away…,I’m really excited to try this with a big group. I have no idea how, but I do expect the experience will change the way we all work in some fundamental way. You know that proverb, ‘If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.’ That sums it up I guess.,Don’t worry, we’ll have a Safe Word.","

"I came across this lonely trailer parked on the corner of Bogart and Boerum Streets, when running this morning in the streets of Bushwick. Looking at it closely, I recognized the signs of greenery, which made me immediately feel uneasy. In our home sweet industrial Bushwick, greenery is rather unusual. After I checked with my eyes again, I recognized that I am seeing A Mobile Public Park, a lovely project by artist ,. The sign was saying that I could come in and enjoy the park in the urban setting.  Hesitantly, I entered the trailer, and took 2 deep breaths. I’m not going to lie:  all the oxygen made me feel dizzy, and deprived me of my usual cranky Bushwick balance. In panic, ran back home. Luckily, I passed by a couple huge trucks on Bogart Street, and inhaled fumes from the cars on Flushing Avenue, feeling eventually better…,All photos by the author using an iPhone (the old and crappy one).,Three , came together for an all-ages sweat fest at , last Friday., ","

"Don’t fret! We are still shooting Bushwick. The following street muses know the balance between keeping warm in the cooler weather and looking great.,Last Sunday welcomed the opening of our borough’s newest flea market, the ,, also known as the ,. The event ran from 5 pm until around midnight and was a huge hit- at times the space was so crowded it was impossible to move!,The Night Bazaar is an extra special add-on to the market, which had already been around, with the addition of 30+ new new businesses. Now the shipping-yard-turned-market features over 50 stores and food places inhabiting the old metal shipping containers. The space looks spiffy and trendy, with the (actually) vintage feel that the old metal housing provides to the stores. The light installations, by ,, were also a nice touch as the sunset faded.,Many different shops have done wonderfully creative things with their allotted space- from light installations to unique paint designs and all-glass fronts. The night was made even better by the special performances of two bands I’m crazy about- Portland’s,and Brooklyn’s own ,.,Not to gush, but ,is really one of the best bands around Brooklyn. I’ve been spinning their LP ,since its release in January and haven’t tired of it yet! To listen is to fall into a cathartic, emotional listening experience. They blend melodic, fall-off-the-bone tender vocals with organic rhythms. I guess the best way to describe their sound is precise- each song perfectly proportioned with intent, not one tangent goes so far as to lose its emotional power. Their sound tends to be minimalist, but it’s never undercooked. It was great to see them performing again, especially with the support of a hyped band like , They performed with passion as usual to an attentive crowd who rocked their hips to Monogold’s oceanic ballads. Catch Monogold play BirdDog Promo’s FREE CMJ show. ,.,- you might have heard about them , but you really can’t begin to understand them until you see them live. Two high-energy, good-looking eccentric Portland weirdos who team up to make spiritual and politically-laden electronic tracks with chantlike, mechanical rhythms. According to the band, Yacht is introduced as “a Band, Belief System, and Business” before delving into a kind of religious ,that encourages creativity from the inner soul. Anyway, peculiar cult-like aura that surrounds the band just adds another level to their music and live performance. This was the second time I’d seen the band and I was just as amazed by the purity of their energy (moonwalking, microphone twirling, stage climbing), the mastery of their stage personas (serious, confident, robotic, and definitely sexy), the quality of their live sound (sometimes apocolyptic and gothic-beated, others hip-sop inspired synth-heavy pop songs)  and the intellectual charm to their stage banter (including dirty jokes, and a tangent by Claire about why women wear lipstick). Playing mostly songs off of their recent album , they pleased the entire crowd into a futuristic, fuzzy, fun frenzy of all-out dancing. Awesome.,There are more roller derby girls living in , than anywhere else…,In order to find out what brings them between the warehouses, I followed the team of the , to a game.,Brooklyn Bombshells were playing semi-finals against the team of ,. Both teams are part of the city female roller derby league ,. Other teams of the league are Manhattan Mayhem and Bronx Gridlock. Gotham Girls have also an inter-league competition between the teams of the Wall Street Traitors and the Gotham Girls All-Stars.,Very unsurprisingly, I started to root for Brooklyn Bombshells right away! And I was right, Bombshells are a bunch of cool girls, they wear navy blue, and their mascot is a sailor. Although, I have to say that Queen of Pain are kinda cool too. Their color is black, and they dress up like domes.  Their mascot is a slave… Lovely, right?,Shortly before the game, Hela Skelter who lives in Bushwick told me that she has been skating for couple of years now, and the sport has virtually taken over her life, but she loves it to death. Hela said that the team practices about 5 times a week in a big hall in Bushwick, which explains why almost every roller derby girl lives in Bushwick.,
,Another Bushwick skater Score of Babylon has awesome tattoos and it not afraid of this contact sport.,
,The game took place at Hunter College in the City, and Brooklyn kicked ass!  They defeated Queens mercilessly, and will be playing the finals again the Bronx on Saturday October 29. So don’t miss it!,

" Dr. Eric Ploumis, Orthodontist and attorney in Bushwick, Stockholm St. in Bushwick, He takes off his dentist coat and he becomes a lawyer dealing with legal matters of other dentists.,Because of his friendly orthodontic practice, community involvement and because he is makes braces look cool for teenagers. And honestly… we just love the name of his practice ,.,***,“You’ll need to improve that brushing, buddy… Because this doesn’t look too good,” says doctor Eric Ploumis friendly. He is wearing a mask when leaning above a young patient in the chair. We are in his orthodontic clinic at Stockholm St. in Bushwick. The boy in the chair points to the blue color when dr. Ploumis presents him a variety of colorful rubbers to be placed in between his braces.,The boy stands up from the chair and dedicates a large grin to my camera. “Those are some cool braces!” I have to admit. “I mean Yo! Braces!”,Dr. Ploumis and his wife, Bushwick’s prominent artist ,, came to Bushwick in 2005. They bought a house at Stockholm St. and remodeled it so that it can accommodate both an artist and a dentist: Deborah works in her studio on the 2nd floor and Dr. Ploumis has a clinic on the 1st floor.,“Thanks to my practice I am meeting different kind of Bushwick people, which is nice,” says dr. Ploumis. “Most of the patients have Medicaid.” The waiting room is full of teenagers, who are cheerful, but they don’t like to be photographed.  I like the name of the orthodontic practice – ,. It’s funny, and plays nicely with the mission of the practice: to offer fun and unique orthodontic experience, which combines personal care and high technology. Dr. Ploumis only smiles when I mention the name.,Dr. Ploumis and his wife have been largely active and supportive of the community. , is a sponsor of a local youth baseball team, and never misses a chance to support where needed.,Dr. Ploumis is giving me a tour of ,. It is a busy place with several doctors and number of nurses. “Some of them live in Bushwick, others commute from elsewhere in Brooklyn.”,“My associate sits in the back.” Dr. Ploumis is also an attorney. He graduated from Pace University Law where he took evening classes. I think it is an unusual combination for a dentist to be a lawyer too.  Dr. Ploumis says he wanted to broaden his knowledge, and was interested in law. Currently, he advises in legal matters to other dentists, which he, as a dentist understands the best.  It is interesting how he switches from dental to legal practice; it basically takes him only to take off his white coat and walk into his office in the back of the clinic….,

							,For over a year, young yoga teacher , has been opening the doors of her beautiful Bushwick loft space, ,. Together with her partner John Kazar, they have been hosting different yoga teachers, teaching themselves, and cultivating their own spiritual education.  It is noteworthy that Boutique Studios request only a modest donation of $10 per intense and quality 90-minute class, providing Bushwick community with one of the cheapest yoga classes in Brooklyn. (We wrote about them previously ,.),On Tuesday, October 24, you can attend the 1st one of the 3 planned workshops about Chakras taught by Kristin Mirabelle and John Kazar. Seven Chakras in our bodies are energy centers that correspond to our physical and mental being.  Kristin says that the workshop will be interactive, extremely informative and comprehensive. “People will leave these workshops feeling like they really know how to do yoga-all aspects from asanas, to meditation, to just knowing themselves better.”,
,This is the story of a baby monster’s love for a human girl. This little girl had super speed vision. She could see individual photons in real time as they were propelled from the sun into the Earth’s atmosphere.,It is not clear whether the little girl ever reciprocated the baby monster’s love. Their relationship was dynamic, the legend says, but little is known of its foundation.,The tale of , is intentionally opaque. Who exactly are the Shiny Pieces? How did they form? And how did they become this dynamic?,~,We are gathered around a table in ,’s recently renovated backyard in Bushwick.  Night has fallen and the air begins to cool quickly. Gillian can’t decide if she is cold or not. I watch her remove and replace her hat for the fifth time.,It’s a curious picture: three cosmically charged pieces at a round table, workshopping each other’s raw material. They feed off each other’s energy, but rather than being destructive, they grow stronger as a unit. The results can be found in their third album, At The Fort Brooklyn, launched just last week in collaboration with ,.,Frank has a theory. “Individually, we are all shiny pieces,” he says, nodding at Gillian and John. “When we combine our powers, we come together. We become Photon Dynamo.”,There is a hum of silence as the group takes this in. This sounds plausible. They nod in agreement.,Each of the shiny pieces can act as a one-man band. “We’re all songwriters. We all put our two cents in,” says Gillian.,While John sticks to drums, Gillian to bass and Frank to guitar, they can all play one another’s instruments and sing. This is uncommon in most bands, they tell me. This way they are less selfish in their songwriting.,A solo artist has just themselves and their guitar to accommodate. A band is comprised of two or more units that must work as one brain. This can become problematic when parts of the band are not considerate of the others.,“I do my best to half-write songs,” says Frank. I don’t question his choice not to one-third-write his songs. A degree of overlap appears necessary, as well as some indulgence.,John tries his best to put every song on the chopping block. He describes himself as a minimalist, which is reflected in his introspective presence at the table.,“I always need to make songs shorter,” he says. “I’m always cutting parts out.”,Gillian pouts. Her songs are usually the longest.,“I bring in a song and he cuts a whole part out,” she laments. “And I’m like, ‘But that’s the part that ties it all together!’”,Although there is occasional head butting, John tells me that the word ‘no’ is a rare utterance at rehearsals. There is no tension between the band mates and they laugh easily at each other and themselves.,“There’s not a lot of ego involved,” Frank says about their process.,I extrapolated the data and made a couple of “scientific” guesses. Perhaps the little girl reciprocated the baby monster’s love. But as luck would have it, such a union was never meant to be. When their dynamic love reached its peak, it exploded into trillions of tiny little light particles. Some became stars. Most blew away. Three little shiny particles, by fate or coincidence, landed in New York City.,The speculation ends there. You know the rest of the story.,
,Bushwick’s , will bring an extraordinary real life performance piece opening this Saturday October 8, 2011. Bushwick-based artist , will give birth to her first child in the gallery. As I had about 500 questions about the concept, and about technical execution of the piece, I stopped by at Microscope to chat with Marni.,
Microscope is a small but bold gallery located just behind the popular café Little Skips. When I arrived Marni and her husband Jason were just setting up the gallery space in order to make it suitable for Marni to give birth. “Is it going to be a boy or a girl?” I ask the first question that came to my mind, although I wasn’t planning it. Marni says they didn’t want to know, so for the moment it is just Baby X. “We will name it once it’s born. “ says Marni.,
The gallery looks nothing like I am used to. It looks like a perfect homebirth room. Marni points out to me three important objects: her deceased grandmother’s bed, the rocking chair, her mother rocked her on when she was a baby, and an inflatable birthing pool.,
“Will you give birth in the pool?”,
“Maybe, I will see.” says Marni.,
Marni doesn’t know when exactly the baby will be born. The month-long exhibition is set around her due date, although according to her own words she feels it might happen on the opening night. The gallery will run on extended hours from 11am to 6pm, and Marni will spend some time there every day. She lives just around the corner, so even if it comes in the middle of the night, she can easily come. Marni doesn’t want the crowds to come; it’s also not very practical as the gallery is really small. Marni will be assisted by a mid-wife and doula.,
Marni says that the performers of the 70s, whose pieces were incredibly raw, have inspired her. There is nothing rawer that life itself, and she considers life to be art. Marni previously created performance pieces stimulating moments of her life such as domestic abuse scene, but also her grandfather’s funeral, or loosing of her virginity. During Bushwick Open Studios she would invite people over and make them dinner. Marni says that while those pieces simulated life, the actual birth of a child will be the ultimate performance piece, the real life.,
There is also another aspect to the piece. “Birth is such a beautiful thing, but it is a taboo in our society.” People don’t like to talk about it; they don’t want to see it. “But what can be more magical than seeing a child being born.”,
I have to agree with Marni. It is curious that the reaction of most of my friends, including myself was, that I wouldn’t like to see a birth.,
Marni continues that her hospital experience even shows that it’s hard to give  natural birth, and one third of all women have Caesarean section, which isn’t always necessary and definitely not natural. “In the hospitals, they have birthing tubes, but they don’t use them, because they are afraid that the baby would drown.”,The strong motive of Marni’s performance is to show that natural birth is possible and beautiful.,
,On Friday afternoon, when I get off the J train at Fulton Street, the clouds are heavy. The chance of rain is almost 60%. I am passing by the 9/11 Memorial, the tourist-beloved department store Century 21, and crowds of people. I am headed to Liberty Plaza with many others who came to express their dissatisfaction with the development of the political and economical situation of the past years. Despite expensive education, many of us are underemployed, job market isn’t getting any better. There doesn’t seem to be the light at the end of the debt crisis tunnel. That’s the most common theme for twenty-something people holding painted cardboards at Liberty Plaza.,The cops are guarding the crowd at Liberty Plaza; you can feel the invisible tension between the protesters and them. The tension keeps growing in the upcoming days with arriving news: 700 people arrested at the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday afternoon. The protesters, who were part of the permitted march on the Bridge, say that they were tricked by the cops, and subsequently arrested. The cops on the other hand say that they were arresting people who were obstructing traffic and marched outside of the pedestrian part of the Bridge. When it comes to mainstream media, I have a good and a bad news. The good news is that they finally noticed, and the story about mass arrest on the Brooklyn Bridge made it to the ,. The bad news is that New York Times can’t seem to be able to decide whom to blame. Website , pointed out how New York Times edited the article 20 minutes after it was released shifting the blame from one side to another:,From , we learn that that JP Morgan Chase informs on their , that they recently donated  $4.6 million dollars to New York City Police Foundation. Buying a protection there?,Besides that the , keeps talking about censorship on Twitter, Google and Yahoo who are allegedly blocking the news about #OccupyWallStreet. According to website ,, whose mission is bringing transparency to capital markets through access to information, JP Morgan Chase has invested in a fund that has bought about $400 million in Twitter Inc. shares, valuing the blogging service at as much as $4.5 billion.,Could it be that that’s why the hashtag #OccupyWallStreet hasn’t been trending on Twitter?,Not even during the increased online activity during the unrest on Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday afternoon when about 20,000 people were watching the live streaming from the Bridge on ,?,Instead of that we have trending hashtags like #YouNeedToRealizeThat or #YouCan’tBeMyBooIf trending all the time. Is this what the conversation is about these days?,[slide],Friday afternoon at Liberty Plaza.,
,is a free annual One Night Only Light Extravaganza that took place this last Saturday night along the Greenpoint waterfront. The event takes place simultaneously all around the world in connection with other Nuit Blanche events. I personally have been looking forward to this event for about 364 days (since ,, which I also covered) and was so excited to experience a night of enthused hoola-hooping and glowstick-wearing crowds, incredible art installations, and of course, pretty lights.,Nuit Blanche aims to express to create a communal experience by utilizing interactive light exhibitions. According to their website, they accomplished this by “Inviting emerging and established artists to make site-specific installations of light, sound, performance and projection art, the event creates an immersive spectacle for thousands of visitors to re-imagine public space and civic life.”,Nuit Blanche expected 10,000 visitors this year and planned their spaces accordingly. The Festival Center took place at the lovely American Playground Park on Franklin Street and featured several beautiful large-scale pieces. The rest of the festival lined the blocks heading towards the waterfront and sprawled across several warehouse spaces. The park featured one of my favorite installations of the night, the very Dan Flavin-esque “Structural Light” (below) by Jason Peter, a geometric series of interconnected gradient-colored florescent light shapes which seemed to be hanging from branches of the magnificent tree above.,The festival might overstate its goals just a little. As far as reimagining civic life goes, there was little to lead me to drastically respect the other festival-goers with new eyes. However, there was a sort of neon comradare that guided the festival to greatness- an eagerness to see spaces, art, color, and Brooklyn in a new “light.” Others’ excellent costumes also enhanced the experience, from glow-in-the-dark hula hoops and facepaint to full-out body art- I met a very special “Glow Man” who was wearing a suit made of tens of tiny, solar-powered UV lights (below).,All in all, the festival was again a vibratingly beautiful, fantastic experience. Major props to the organizers and artists that make this night very special for thousands of people. Counting the days til Nuit Blanche 2011. Head over to their , to see more photos and learn more about the featured artists from the event.,Rattapallax Productions created this awesome short film about Bushwick Pigeon Keepers. “It’s like religion,” says the pigeon keeper in the film. Quite a strong statement, but the truth is that the pigeons flying in flocks above our heads became quite a symbol of Bushwick. …well, regardless any pigeon related religious questions, the film is great.,Featuring 2Tone, Super 13 & Goodwin,

Between his fantastic Northside shows (featuring ,, , and ,) and the 2-day festivals he’s been booking at Brooklyn FireProof (featuring the likes of , and more), BirdDog is getting press for throwing some of the best shows in Brooklyn. So when I got the chance to be his intern I basically drooled at the opporunity. Last weekend was an infamous free << WAREHOUSE PARTY >> that involved a incredible line-up featuring bands hailing from BK, Baltimore, Richmond and beyond- ,, and ,. The space, called “Delinquency BLVD (basically at Grand and Morgan in Bushwick) is probably the best-looking warehouse I’ve been to- with a skylight, walls covered in autographs and drawings, and an amazing light installation from ,. I caught the latter half of the show, with 3 great bands, and ended the night with shots of georgi and epic R&B dance party that was both unforgettable and really hard to recall.,Bushwick has officially kicked off the art season of the fall 2011! You could tell by the scandalous number of art opening being held almost every day. Walking in Bushwick feels like a never-ending art walk. Here are some impressions from the art-heavy second week of September.,On Wednesday night, ,‘s solo show , was opening in ,. The show featured photographic and video works.,950 Hart is one of the new galleries in Bushwick; for me and many others at the opening  it was the first time there. It was a raining mayhem in Bushwick, but regardless, I undertook to attend, and it was a great decision…!,
,Over at ,, they opened the season with a group show called ,, of video, photographic, and mixed media works, featuring some of their favorite, previously showcased artists. Jonas Mekas, Allison Somers, Nick Zedd, to name a few.,The very first show opened at , at 56 Bogart Street. Look at the pieces that caught my attention.,I gladly accepted the invitation to visit a studio and the home of Bushwick-based artist,, (we featured Mary as a Tuesday Person ,. Mary invited over,, her year-long friend from Italy. As part of Simona’s ongoing studio project, Mary surrendered her studio to Simona for couple of days. Simona told me that this is a studio #3. The first one took place in Italy, when she opened her studio to the public in her home Perugia. She was really excited when I told her that we have a similar, annual ,, when virtually everyone opens their studio to the public. Simona is fascinated by the intimacy of workspace of other people, where you can see their thoughts being transformed into tangible items. She didn’t make any plans about the installation at Mary’s studio, she said she would see. The only thing she brought with her, was a screen to project her own window into the window of Mary Judge.,

,The finale of the acclaimed series of Friday art shows , at , made me a little nostalgic. Well, the summer is over, and so will be the awesome roof deck at 910 Grand Street in October when NURTUREart is moving to the new space at 56 Bogart Street. And however,  the new location will be closer to Bushwick folks and right in the Bushwick art center,  Marco Antonini, a director of the non-profit, sadly admitted there is no roof there…. However, we enjoyed the roof dearly and partied to celebrate all the great work NURTUREart has done there.,

", a post-punk 70s fem band kicked off their North American tour at ,, Greenpoint’s combination rock club-Polish National House, on Saturday. It is the first of six rare shows scheduled to promote the reissue of their sophomore album ,, originally released in 1981.,One-lady act No Bra and three-piece girl band Grass Widow appear earlier on this estrogen-powered bill, with all-girl DJ set Tobi Vail (Bikini Kill) & Amy Yao (Emily’s Sassy Lime) arranged to conclude the night.,Anticipation is running high on the queue outside Warsaw, as the bands spend an extra hour setting up. Emma Casey, 20, is near the front of the line hoping that the doors will open soon.,“There’s nothing like them,” she says about the headlining band. “Their sound is organic. The sound they make on stage is the same as the one they record in the studio.” She finds that this is a rarity among new bands.,Warsaw finally opens its doors once the line reaches the end of the street. A steady stream of people slowly fills the hall. Some head for the bar while others make a beeline for the refreshments room to grab a plate of pierogies before the start of the show.,Sound check begins just as the crowd starts to thicken. A lot of older fans can be seen milling around.,Mark Bourdeau, a college teacher, is so delighted that he nearly hops up and down. He enjoys listening to “thinking person’s music.” This stuff is genuinely quirky, simple and ironic in a way that is not mean, he says.,The Raincoats are a special group to Mark. “They are not a female version of anything,” he says. Other female rock icons of the same era were often compared to other men, like Joan Jett, who was sometimes credited as the female Chuck Berry.,When the ladies hit the stage their energy sends the crowd into motion. A lot has changed since this band’s official start in 1977, but their enthusiasm has certainly not diminished.,“More bass!” someone calls from the crowd after the first song. The Raincoats quickly oblige. They are not hesitant to interact with their fans. As Anne Woods tears into her violin as though it were a guitar, Gina Birch fans the flames in the crowd.,“You ask me if I’m angry? I say, why the hell would I not be?” she cries out. Her question meets an eruption of cheers.,While some of music’s more academic critics worry about equating types of music with sexuality, The Raincoats have an unmistakable female sound. Songs like “In Love” and “No Looking,” Emma says, have ways of reassuring young female fans that other punk sounds do not.,“Yeah that’s what is feels like,” Emma says, referring to the two songs as a set. “Being elated – in love.”,Female fans aren’t the only ones to feel rewarded tonight. As the front of the crowd works itself into a frenzy, one particularly affected young man finds his way onto the stage. The show can be considered a hit at this point.,“You ask me if I’m happy,” Gina sings softly. “I say, why the hell would I not be?”,How ironic is it that we had 65 degree weather, wind, and rain the day after Labor Day? Summer is still here (technically). It was a bit hard finding great looks in the rain, but check how these hotties dress for the cooler weather. Call it pre-Fall wear.. Bushwick style.,. The name comes from a World War I novel ,, by Dalton Trumbo, about a soldier Johnny, who was unable to communicate with the outside world due to the extent of his wounds. In early 2011, war artist , took the name and formed ,, a project that brought together war illustrators and highlighted their drawings of soldiers wounded in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, undergoing rehabilitation…,
,When art writer , was offered to curate his first art show ever at Bushwick gallery ,, he decided to contact Michael Fay, and compile an exhibition from amongst John Bonham Project artists. John Bonham Project comes right in time to commemorate 9/11, and as James says, 9/11 didn’t end for the soldiers who were part of the combat that followed this tragic event of the modern history.,The exhibition opened last Thursday, and coming to Storefront felt different than on other occasions. The familiar space was filled with soldiers in their festive uniforms. Many of them got a special leave from the military, James tells me later.,The art works hanging on the walls are mostly pencil and charcoal drawings; some are black and white; others are colored. Some of the drawings contain also notes of the artist, taken while sketching and interviewing the wounded soldier. You can observe the drawings of soldiers recovering from dismemberment, facial damages…. Looking at the drawings makes me feel a little uncomfortable, but also curious about the stories behind the work.,The greatest attention in Bushwick receives a young marine , and his two pencil portraits of soldiers recovering from facial disfigurement. The execution of the pencil drawing is perfect, and furthermore the faces, despite the injuries, depict a lot of emotion and thought. I look them closer in the eye, trying to understand how someone like that must have felt, expecting maybe a look of a hero who wants nothing but our everlasting gratitude. Or maybe a look of someone excruciated by the fate, which caused him to experience the agony of pain. But all I see is a boy who is a little sad, but dealing with the slow recovery from his injuries, and who can’t wait to go home…,
,Artist Judith Braun and I approach Rob Bates, who smiles humbly, and tells us that that one is nothing, pointing to the drawing.  He says it took him only about 45 minutes to make each of them. “Look at this one,” Rob says, and pulls out his iPhone to show us an amazingly realistic pencil portrait.,“So you’ve been to combat?” Judith asks Rob.,“Yes, ma’am!” Rob answers, and I have to smile. Rob tells us he has been to Afghanistan twice, and currently is serving his last 4 months in the military before he retires. Rob is maybe my age, and I am interested about his further life plans. He wants to go back home to North Carolina, and apply to art school, for an MFA program.,Rob tells us that many galleries and museums haven’t been so welcoming like Storefront. Often, they feel like the portrayed bodies missing limbs are too much for them. But Bushwick, that’s a different story…,The Joe Bonham Project is,on view at , through September 18.,
							,On Sunday I wandered over to the ,‘s Williamsburg location to browse vintage clothing and furniture, modern art and jewelry, and everything handmade in between. The BK Flea chills out in Fort Greene on Saturdays and in the ‘Burg Sundays, located at East River State Park, along the waterfront, the space featured up to fifty crafts vendors, and also amazing food options, all with a gorgeous view of the Manhattan Skyline. Check out all of the vendors , my favorites included , (a handmade jewelery, etc store) where I was tempted by typewriter-key rings (see below), , (a great “junk” / assorted bric-a-brack store where I snagged a Minolta camera for $20!) and ,(amazing kimchi and other asian-inspired hot dogs). Be sure to check the Flea out.,That has been my mantra since October last year. Yes, I am talking about the ,. We have been introducing a person belonging to the exceptional community of the town of Bushwick every Tuesday. Tuesday People have been mostly artists, because Bushwick has an amazingly thriving art scene, but we had also local entrepreneurs, fashion illustrator, psychic, and others. The 1st edition of Tuesday People was successfully wrapped up by , comprised of the works of 14 Tuesday People, held during and after Bushwick Open Studios ’11. Shortly after we restarted the series with a Summer Edition of Tuesday People. The photos were taken mostly outdoors, and we talked about people in a summery light manner.,Today we are starting the Fall edition of Tuesday People featuring an artist, ,. The article is a collaboration for the 1st time in the history of Tuesday People: text by Sarah Hassan + photos by Katarina Hybenova. But before you start reading the story, let me remind you of the best moments with the summer Tuesday People….,
, doesn’t like to talk about himself. Blame it on his midwestern upbringing;  He was born in Dayton, Ohio, and grew up with a set of traditional values that did not lend themselves to breeding self-indulgent conversationalists. Lucky for him, his current body of work generously comprised of mixed media and found objects, speaks volumes. With a gentle manner and careful way he chooses his words, Anspaugh is an understated cabinet of curiosities, from the open spaces he knew as a child, to the fury and mania of New York City, where he now resides amidst the blossoming industrial landscape of Bushwick.,Like so many of the young and hungry artist-cum-transplants living in the city, thirty year-old Anspaugh has a lot to say on his family, influences, aspirations and fears. Yet whether waxing philosophic on consumer culture or admitting his hatred for the smell of latex, Anspaugh is just as warm and generous as you might imagine someone fresh from the Midwest to be. But don’t let the quiet reserve fool you; there is a fierce and hotly energetic quality to his work that recalls de Kooning, Twombly, Rauschenberg, and most of all, Basquiat, artists whose influences he candidly owns up to. Surrounded by his works-in-progress and finished pieces, I sat down with Anspaugh in his home studio and spoke about what drives him as an artist, how New York City has served his creative process, and of his upcoming residency in Berlin.,Though attracted to art at a young age – his great-grandmother and mother were both artists – Anspaugh claims music as an early love, rock n’ roll on par with colored pencils and pastels handed to him by teachers all-too aware of his visual talents. Staples of suburban life were The Rolling Stones and Aerosmith, the latter a band which, when seen live, hit Anspaugh in the gut; “I had a profound sense of ‘this is how I want to present myself,’ to connect with people in that way,” he explained. Serving some time in a music band, the experience eventually led Anspaugh back to art. He attended college at the University of Central Florida, which he admitted was a mainly a geographic desire to distance himself from home. “I did have that yearning,” he said astride a stool in his studio, “and I still do, of not wanting to stay put, and it is so hard for me because I want to move on. I struggle with the idea that ‘this can’t be all there is.’ These anxieties were aggravated by Anspaugh’s move to New York City, a place he has never felt truly settled, but nonetheless understands its crucial nature for the life of an artist.,“Everyone in my family told me I was crazy to move to New York,” he laughed. I could imagine. “What are you really going to go, what are you going to do for your job, not just your hobby? Those voices, those negative voices, have given me my inspiration and drive. They are a real source of energy for me.” When I point out the fantastic sense of urban desperation to his pieces, whether scrawled upon, dripping with paint, slashed at, or crumpled that give the viewer an idea of what living in New York is like, Anspaugh admits to his work being consumed by the city. The many layers of ugliness, vibrancy and vitality that blanket day-to-day life oozes freshness at Anspaugh’s hand as he grapples with the experience of the ever-changing and never satisfied. What drew me to his work when I first encountered it at ,, was its’ familiar renderings of playful rage. The grotesque faces, the bright colors, the bold streaks and sheer enormity of some of the pieces were overwhelming to behold, yet strangely pleasing to submit to. For all of its visual violence, there is a dreamy quality to the world Anspaugh depicts; some pieces have you staring down them like the proverbial rabbit-hole, easy to get lost in the swirl of colors and geometric patterns, as nameless faces beg to be read from the sidelines.,These nameless faces abound in Anspaugh’s work, a fertile terrain of primary colors populated with masks of all shapes and sizes. When asking him about this trademark, my initial hypothesis of his obsession and love for masks was dashed when he admitted to having an actual fear of them. “It came from my childhood,” he explained, “this repulsion and fear, especially of latex Halloween masks, and it was an intense emotional experience. I still have the aversion, I can hardly eat during the month of October, but making the masks helps me to focus on it. You can’t ignore that, to find that thing that gives you a life’s work, really. I realized I had something here, and I wanted to move forward.” With this, Anspaugh gives new meaning to ‘face your fears,’ as he has taken that which confuses and repulses him and has confronted it visually to the point of domination.,Yet it is ‘moving forward’ that could be the Anspaugh motto, as his work, much like his mental state, is always striving for that which has yet to be reached. Yet his anxieties stop when taking his current body of work into account; he never feels that ‘you’re only as good as your last piece,’ as he recognizes whatever work came before has indeed led him to the present moment. That present moment is an exciting one, for soon he will embark on a three-week residency in Berlin courtesy of the,Venezuelan American Endowment for the Arts which will give him the much-needed time, space and freedom to create. When I asked him if he had any expectations of the residency, Anspaugh took a moment and said, with a wide grin, “It will get me out of my routine.” I urged him to continue, and his reply betrayed a matter-of-factness courtesy of the midwest; “I’ll walk the streets, experience something new. I’m not expecting it to change my life.”,
,Wait… it’s September already? Didn’t the summer just start? The season is not over just yet! Celebrate the last few weeks of summer with breezy tops and colorful hues. Check out these Bushwick cuties flaunting summer’s best street fashion!,After weeks of lazy summer heat, a front of cool autumn air revives the electric current between my neurons and spark my enthusiasm back into the creative rotation of the universe. With that productivity comes a sincere motivation to be productive by false means, such as spending more hours awake. I have had a terrible sleeping schedule all summer, comprised of mostly working after sunset, but this change in climate has only enforced this schedule with ,rationality. Every day I plan to wear myself out earlier than the night before, but perhaps try to hard, as I only burn myself out too early, then have to rest before continuing my plan for the day around the same time that most would be retiring for the night. My thoughts about what more there is left to accomplish in my agenda keeps me awake during these rest periods, while I am too exhausted to actually sustain any level of productivity other than lying down and watching Mad Men or whatever show series is first in my Netflix instant que that month. I have tried valerian root, melatonin, red wine, food comas, and alternately – jogging. The result is either I feel too good to waste it on sleep, I feel too full to lie down, or too energized to sit – respectively.,Sometimes I make the mistake of throwing stimulants into the mix…,Late night espressos at Goodbye Blue monday, loosies [loose cigarettes bought individually - for those of you new to the black market of Brooklyn tabacco], and Chateau Diana “Wine Product” from Mr. Kiwi – sold all hours of the night due to its low alcohol content.,…and end up sitting on my new stoop with my new toy, taking photos of green things before their time of decay, against this concrete sunrise.,▲▲▲▲▲▲▲,Stay on top of what’s being written about Bushwick and what’s going around town. We read everything for you and choose the most important stuff.,*** I’m very sad to have to start this week’s Bushwick Reader with news that ,. , that she was riding southbound on Bushwick Ave. and rode through a construction site near Powers St., when suddenly lost her balance near a pile of loose wood on the street after a car horn honked and she turned her head, fell toward traffic, and was run over by a car.

Ok, folks, I gotta run to throw up…. ***,There is an event in Bushwick that combines learning, community, conversation and drinking in magnificent fashion. That event is Presentation Party Night and it just celebrated it’s one year anniversary.,PPN—as it’s loyalists lovingly refer to it—is a free lecture and beer series held on the third Sunday of every month at 7pm, usually in an apartment on Jefferson Street. It’s potluck style food and BYOB with donations encouraged for a group beer fund. The evening consists of six 10-minute presentations on whatever topic the presenters choose (be it nerdy, bizarre or both) followed by a question and answer period.,And that Q+A is where the fun really begins.,Because that’s when a group discussion takes off where people engage, ask questions, shout their opinions and spark intense debates and hilarious conversations.,At the most recent PPN—aside from the amazing food—there was history, there was art, there was jokes, there was absurdist fiction, there was “adventures with silicone” and the last presentation was on the past, present and future of PPN itself.,Begun by Dan Dreke with assists from Drew Weigel, Joe Gillette and many others, PPN has grown over it’s inaugural year into one of those consistently fun and unpredictable happenings.,There is a core group of friends and acquaintances that show up each month as well as various newcomers that may only attend once but always make for a great crowd. The variety of topics also keep the energy going throughout the night. Sometimes a theme emerges, sometimes a party does.,One of the best things about it is you never know what you’ll learn. Some of my personal favorite topics from past PPNs include “The Upside of Pessimism,” “How to Hit It, Quit It, and Split It (Like You Never Did It),” “The Life and Work of Alexander McQueen,” “How to Survive the Apocalypse,” “A History of Video Game Storytelling,” “The Two Sides of L. Ron Hubbard,” “Kennings,” “Neurobiology of Opiate Tolerance,” “Who Let ‘Who Let the Dogs Out’ Out: Intellectual Property Rights,” “Taxonomic Creeperisms” and everyone’s holiday favorite, “The Christmas Krampus.”,I am friends with the group who runs this excellent affair and have presented twice myself (Decision Making and Carrie Nation) and along the way, I’ve discovered a few things:,1. Anyone can present. Everyone is an expert on something—some random topic—that they are passionate about. And that’s all it takes to give a good presentation. And failing that, Wikipedia works too.,2. Don’t force it or over think it. What do you love? Obscure sports? Guerilla knitting? Arrow’s Impossibility Theorum? Do it. Don’t worry if you think no one is interested. They will be. People will respond. Add jokes and people will laugh. Enthusiasm is all that matters.,3. Don’t even worry about taking up 10 minutes. Some of the best presentations are really more like propositions. The crowd will then take over and the discussion/debate that ensues is where the real wisdom emerges. That’s why a good presenter—like a good artist or philosopher or scientist—is simply one that knows how to ask the right questions.,And PPN is always in need of new presenters as well as potential spaces to hold the event. So if you think you have an idea, give ‘em a shout. And if you deicide to stop by, I’m sure you’ll agree with the hope that this thing lasts well into the future.,http://ppn-nyc.blogspot.com/","

"Walk through Bushwick on Sunday afternoon when Irene was still a little angry, however her bitchiness wasn’t by any means as bad as we expected, was pleasantly industrial. The Irene aftermath in Bushwick resembled a cloudy, windy day, rather than an apocalypse.,Bushwick local Beto Vargas’ funny report post-Irene Bushwick, on ‘extensive’ damage, ‘risking life’, and finding out the place looks like a ghetto… Luckily, we can enjoy this funny video. Come back also tomorrow, for a post-Irene photo essay.,“I can’t hear the X’s, can you turn up the squares?”,It occurred to me in my third year out of college, after receiving my appropriately titled BS degree in “Organizational and Political Communications” that people will infrequently be able to read your mind. While we may have progressed over a very long period of time from non-verbal to oral and then to written languages, our thoughts often times are hardly any more complex than our ancestors. That is to say, by , we really ought to have figured out how to communicate telepathically. In the last half century and longer there have been comprehensive and , accounts of astral projection, telepathy and distance healing which unfortunately was allotted to a select stereotype of spiritual mediums and enlisted by those of catholic and christian faiths to the army of satanist witches.,Now that we have established that your friends and bosses are not psychically intuitive, nor are inclined towards developing a loving relationship where you live inside each other’s heads, , we can safely say that communicating will forever be one of humanities greatest tragedies. Where a lack of communication can build suspense and drama keeping us feeding – pacified by the tubes of entertainment, conversely it can single handedly crumble empires and affairs of Roman magnitude.,When locked away in a dark cave as I often am, to utter a single note – let alone one of protest or opposition, can seem daunting. “Why rock the boat?” they say; “Why live if you don’t?” proclaim others. I could argue that my four year college education was useless and stand behind silence speaking volumes because it happens to be true, but it would be more true to say that a calculated silent pause in the middle of a well-delivered rhetoric can speak to the hearts of millions and simply change the world.,So please, get off your ipad and learn how to speak – these last two generations need a coherent voice.,▲▲▲▲▲▲▲,Bushwick sky is wider and Bushwick clouds are puffier. Enjoy the sights brought to you by a late summer evening in our beloved pigeon town…,10:15am on a Monday in , feels pretty early. The neighborhood is quiet, and the air is a bit chilly, despite the sun shining bright. I am suddenly reminded of the inevitable arrival of fall, soon. , and I are taking a little walk in the closeness of his studio at Hart St. Cooper’s studio is in an old factory, which is hidden, a bit surprisingly, between the residential buildings. This is Bushwick.,Cooper is one of the Bushwick artists, proudly creating collage, and he says that it’s the perfect medium for the times we live in. Earlier in his studio he pulled out a bunch of cuttings from magazines and papers for his next project. Right now his studio is rather empty; good empty- most of his work is hanging in galleries., is his solo show at Bushwick’s Storefront. Cooper who is originally from Detroit says that he grew up hearing how things in Detroit used to be perfect before, and now are not anymore. He is coming from the environment where fathers worked in factories believing that their children will once be executives there; families owned Herman Miller furniture in their vinyl-sided houses… “Capitalist Utopia,” says Cooper. “It never existed.” His show at Storefront is a gentle mockery of the loyalty to the American middle class lifestyle of the 20th century and it’s values.,“How do you like people in New York?” I’m asking. “Are they different than people in Detroit?”,
“Oh my god! They are very different. People in Detroit are nice. And polite!” He is laughing. “But people in Bushwick are a very different story. People here are really nice.” I concur.,“Snow cones!” Cooper stops a snow cone vendor, after I’m being curious about what he enjoys in Bushwick. Cooper spent quite some time in South America, in Chile and in Brazil, and maybe that’s where he became addicted to this simple treat. The vendor lifts a towel from a piece of ice, and proceeds to scratch it only to get two cups full of snow. Cooper knowledgably points his finger to the bottle containing lemon juice and the vendor pours it on two cups, and inserts a straw into each of them. “One’s for you,” says Cooper, and I am thinking “Oh, shit. I didn’t notice if the ice was clean.” But it’s time to loosen up and enjoy some local treats. The lemon juice is bitter and intensively sweet.,“You know how in New York, even if you go to a bar by yourself, someone will talk to you even if you don’t know them.” Cooper continues in our discussion about people. ”So in Finland that would never happen. People there seemed pretty cold. Unlike Swedes who were really friendly.” Cooper seems like he’s happy everywhere, and I’m guessing he was also pretty happy in Europe where he spent some time at an art residency. His artistic path has been quite interesting so far. He started as a political science major ready to take the LSATs, but eventually ending up taking so many art courses, he received also an art degree.,He sips his lemon juice because the snow has melted.,If you spent past 24 hours meditating in a cave in Nepal, or if you just happened to be returning from your weekend getaway at Neptune, you probably don’t know that we had an earthquake yesterday! The entire Bushwick (,) now knows, how the magnitude of 5.9 feels like. And I can tell you it feels funny, shaky, and a little ,.,You probably saw your lamps, and felt your stomach swaying from side to side. I personally accused my roommate of shaking my desk when I’m trying to work, when she yelled “Earthquake!” and tried to run out of our Bushwick apartment. I argued that this is no California, and therefore this cannot be an earthquake. After the shaking continued, I decided to check on twitter, whether this was a real earthquake or not. Because where else would you go to verify if there was a natural event/potential disaster in progress. These are the Bushwick/Brooklyn tweets I saw:,Ok, so my roommate wasn’t the only one who thought it was an earthquake ,And really, twitter is the place to find out, about everything basically…,Some of our favorite art bloggers were quick enough to tweet about some earthquake art. Seriously, I admire the speed ,…and some haters out there envying our earthquake in NY. well, you gotta deserve one, you know ,Don’t worry, David, not only Bushwick , important, we felt the earthquake here too! wohoo!,Actually, it’s good to check if everyone is ok…,True…. The trucks are ruining the earthquake experience by making the earth shaking less special!,….and finally some hipster tweets ,The Bushwick Food Coop recently hosted a Clothing Swap! Locals came out and brought pieces of clothing to exchange (neat!) — hot jeans, pretty dresses, vintage purses and shoes, and quirky prints. The event was made perfect with great indie music and home cooked food.,All proceeds benefited the Bushwick Food Coop. The Bushwick Food Coop is a member-owned cooperative that is currently operating as a buying club out of Brooklyn Fireproof and is working toward opening a grocery store.,Check out some of the great looking attendees searching for Buchwick treasures.,What I have always admire, beyond an artist, is the artist’s ability to express themselves in a coherent and concise maner.,David Lynch does just that. Maybe not in his films, or when speaking on the topic of his films, but  certainly in his lectures on transcendental meditation. Unlike Lao Tze in the “,,” where ideas of being centered to achieve enlightenment are illustrated in the most abstract fashion:,David Lynch uses ,, and catching fish to illustrate the process of letting ideas flow in a river of thought, and keeping a metaphysical eye out for the big ones.,That being said, I have to go fish some more. Come see what I catch tonight, two new performances at R Bar around 10:30 and 12 for the ,.,▲▲▲▲▲▲▲,One of my favorite things to do is explore a new city or neighborhood and I’ve always thought one of the best ways to do it is a running tour.,Now Bushwick isn’t exactly new to me but whenever I run there, I find it has new things to say.,Sightseeing on foot allows you to stop and investigate things; to interact with people and puppies. It allows you to see what’s going on up close, smell the smells, hear the sounds and catch the photo ops.,You can’t cover as much ground walking than you can by bike or car though, so running is the way to go, allowing maximum flexibility and freedom. Not to mention it’s a decent workout.,Of course, I’m a runner and actually enjoy this sometimes grueling activity. So for anyone not so inclined, you can still experience the highlights with me now.,The route is your basic loop, 8 miles beginning and ending at my apartment. Like a sort of urban obstacle course, it includes long, uphill straight-aways early on and then shorter block zig zags towards the end, trying to hit any parks I could along the way. I’m pretty sure at some point I was technically in Ridgewood but for any fellow Bushwick runners, I recommend it to get a good sense of the variety in this part of town. Some stretches were through wide open industrial sections, some through denser residential areas and the last mile went right through the new Bushwick Artist Market on Bogart. I strayed off course quite often when something grabbed my interest but this map shows the general path. The numbers indicate roughly where each photo was taken. So lace up—and let’s go.,
,Biking down to the studio of ,, I felt like I have more questions that information. Mathew lives right above ,, which used to be ,, he adds immediately as if he wanted to underline the sanctity of what used to be a legendary art pop-up gallery lead by ,.,Matthew Miller is a likable peaceful guy, polite, and friendly who never speaks too much nor too little. He likes to go out to see the art shows in Bushwick. With his conservative look, he is nothing like a Bushwick hipster, actually quite to the contrary; he likes to wear dress pans with dress shoes, and a simple white t-shirt.,As I lock my bike and follow him up the stairs to his studio, I can’t wait to see how and if his newest works changed since the huge wave of media interest in Matthew’s person. Virtually every prime art publication in the country rushed to review his recent solo show at ,, a DIY gallery developed in the basement of a Ridgewood house. Matthew opens the door of the a small neat studio, which serves also as a bedroom; the air-conditioner is silently buzzing, cooling off the space to the perfect temperature, the floor is wiped clean, the books are straighten in a bookshelf. Matthew probably noticing my surprise excuses the perfectly clean room by saying that he can’t paint in a mess. After reading about Matthew’s work in , I was expecting, maybe a little bit more of fanciness, but I received a portion of Bushwick reality where artists are leading double lives, the first life, the necessary one at a day job from 9 to 5; then the second one in the evenings and early mornings, creating, planning, showing in galleries, being reviewed by ,.,One entire wall is covered with brown paper, but not a single drop of paint has touched it. That’s Matthew’s painting area. Wood panels are leaning against the wall; one of them is being worked on. It is a painting of Matthew’s head on the black background, not dramatically different from the 8 self-portraits exhibited at Famous Accountants. “This one has the nose sticking slightly to the side, I have never painted it like that, so it’s interesting.” Matthew says. I feel like I am slowly exploding with questions: Why the black background? Why the self-portraits? What emotions, are if any are the heads going through? And lastly what is the message he’s trying to convey?,“Technically, it’s not a black background.” Matthew starts patiently. “It’s more like a space to stimulate one’s imagination. It’s like looking into an open door against bright sun. You know that there are things inside of the door, but you can’t see any. Just like the name of the Famous Accountants show: ,”,Matthew continues to shatter my previous ideas about the motives behind his work. “In fact, I don’t like to look at these as at self-portraits. They are not personal. I just used my face, because that’s the face I know the best. So it’s just a person who looks like me. ”,I am happy to discover that Matthew doesn’t always paint only portraits of himself; he shows me a portrait of a black guy, and a golden-haired woman, both painted the same way, on a wood panel with a black background. Matthew explains that he didn’t show these alongside the portraits of himself at Famous Accountants, because it could mislead the viewer even more, who would then might have been tempted to think about who are those other people, and what is the relationship between them and Matthew. Matthew says that that’s absolutely not the way he wants to go, and that he is only interested in exploration of portraiture, and the interaction of the viewer and the painting. He purposely paints his portraits with a neutral face expression, which according to him stimulates viewer’s imagination way more than a particular emotion, however strong it might be. “Every one knows that it’s not just a painting, not a person they are looking at. You can’t enter their space for example.”,“Aren’t you scared that your subconsciousness might ruin this pure portrait exploration, and bring in something you wouldn’t expect. Like an emotion?” I am curious. “No, subconsciousness is welcomed. ” Matthew says with a smile.","

, from , on ,.,Bushwick-based artist and musician ,, a Bushwick Daily’s Tuesday Person eventually gets impressed by performance art at festival , in Sammatti, Finland, he had visited this in July 2011.,
,It all starts with a duck, and as I am told a small duck at that. Some insist that it was an eagle, but I doubt that. Would an eagle dive to the bottom of the watery nothingness that existed before anything, and pluck up a bit of mud in its bill to create an island that would become the nesting ground for the egg that would break open, and create the cosmos: the bottom half becoming earth and the other sky?,Eagles- Fuck all y’all, this clearly is duck territory!,So begins the world according to the ,, the sacred text of the oral traditions of the Finish Lapland shaman.  The Kalevala was compiled by philologist, Elias Lönnrot (1802-1884), who was born and spent his childhood in a small cottage called Paikkari, built on the grounds in Sammatti, Finland that served this summer as the site of the festival of Performance Art. The Festival was a few hours drive from Helsinki into the beautiful countryside, where at night in late July, the stars shine, and the sky becomes the deepest shade of blue, but still the sunset never ends…,I have rarely considered performance art to be more than an amusing diversion, but this event with it’s gorgeous natural setting and the artists’ rich and diverse reinterpretations of tradition, made me think of performance, with it’s insistence on its own transience as of a continuation of something ancient and mythic, when magic and rituals sought to exercise change in a world where normal actions often fell short.,
,The day of diverse performances began with tradition: a shaman recited ancient words for the benefit of us all, in a language that is no longer spoken, the sounds that make the thing, a place where the signified speaks it’s own sign.  From then on it was a free range of media and ideas.  The works often made use of humor. Then laughter would often turn to contemplation of poetic melancholy. It was evident that the artists were set on injecting contemporary relevance into their inspiration from the ,.,
,What really amazed me about the Paikkari Performance, was the crowd. New York has made me accustomed to “performance art” events where the audience is composed mostly of participants. Here the audience was full of children and families. From my brief stay there I gained the impression that I had never been in a society who has so integrated the ideas of the historical avant-garde…,I think that all artists should visit Finland. Even if it is only to consider if this is a world they would want.,

Bushwick!,When I first moved to New York I was excited to discover all the Jazz cafes my former neighbor and jazz musician had told me about. However, all my searches came to dead ends at the entrances of large venues charging $30 covers for traveling musicians far from native to this city. My second round of searches brought me inside of numerous interiors of covert speakeasies full to the brim with expensive cocktail lists, hand carved ice cubes, and the worst talent , I have witnessed to date. Apparently the rise of cocktail/mixology culture in NYC was the fall of non-commercialized entertainment.,This seems to ring true with much of the entertainment industry these days. Where I can walk into , and hear vocals on a loop, recorded 5minutes prior to the performance, played in conjunction with a piano chord, and a haunting vocal melody I still hear the ghost of in my ears.,Somewhere between hand written signs, hand glued album covers and bags of dirt at the merch table, the industry has replanted it’s roots across from the , gym sprawling across the top floor of what might be an old meat packing factory.,While traveling to Chicago and LA I follow scant, wind blown, breadcrumb trails left by bored natives and passers by, to find gold at the , and ,.

She will be way better off as a smart, computer savvy girl!” Blue Fairy pinched the Pink one. Baby Ashley sleeping in the cradle grunted, perhaps because of the fairies quarrelling, but kept on wandering in her baby dreams. “Awww…,” the fairies sat on the side of the cradle. They were looking at the sleeping baby, and in order to make a well-informed decision about the baby Ashley’s future, they proceeded to get high…. Nobody remembers how the night ended, nor what the Pink and the Blue Fairy agreed on, but when , grew up, she was pretty as a top model, and html fluent. She decided to become an artist.,Nowadays, you can meet Ashley, most likely wearing heels, walking between the warehouses in Bushwick, to her studio and her second home ,, the art space she runs. To  my question “How does the stay in industrial Bushwick influences your life?” she answers that she’s back on being a vegetarian, pointing her finger to the stinky meat-packing factory across the street, but otherwise she’s doing great. She likes being away from people, having some quiet time to think about her art projects.,When I met Ashley for the first time, she pulled out a plastic bag with 2 frozen birds from a freezer in her studio. “Aren’t they beautiful?” she smiled with sparks in her eyes. Ashley used to make glass coffins for dead birds that she laboriously collected from befriended zoos. She would hermetically seal the glass, and as the birds started to decompose, the chemical process consumed all the oxygen, result of which was a preserved beautiful corps of a colorful bird. Looking just like alive.,“But why?” I made a peep, demanding an explanation. “It’s inspired by Buddhism. They make little children meditate on dead birds, so that they realize that this life is temporary. And as the children grow, they meditate on bigger dead animals. God, how I wish I had a flamingo. ” Ashley said dreamily. “But at the zoo, they thought I was a creep….” she pressed her lips bitterly just like someone who had to found out on her own that it takes time for the world to catch up.,Lately, Ashley has been converged back to the great Virtual Reality, and has been using , browsing popular forums and collecting interesting stuff.,Another of her planned artistic ventures is called ,. Ashley plans to construct an object out of hexadecimal in 3D using a build-at-home makerbot kit to construct a 3d printer and print her sculpture.,Ashley and I are took a walk through industrial Bushwick, admiring heavy machinery, while workers didn’t even try to hide their excitement about a tall blond girl. Aerial cranes, trucks, mechanical carts, boxes full of Chinese plastic toys, a notice not to park your car there, because HBO will be filming some rape scenes in the area….,.,There is a really awkward date with possible linguistic barriers going on behind me at the moment, and I, am not twittering about it… Instead I have stepped straight of the airplane and into Yaffa Cafe , in order to concentrate on some very , belated writing exercises ,.,My trip was very relaxing, , I didn’t look at my twitter feed once and only once scowled at my plethora of facebook notifications from events 900 miles away from anywhere I would ever admit to being.,My great escape to the west was scowl free ,; I was starting to miss furrowing my eyebrows, narrowing my eyes and dropping the sides of my mouth. Luckily, the screaming child on the plane ride warmed me up, and had prepared me for the launch of my social applications. I immediately felt the wave of regretful passivity and jealously of people who were doing things that in all likelihood, I would hate to actually be doing. And then I look at the “feeds” of the people who are generally in positions in life which I would not mind being in and quickly realize I would rather not have that insight. Flashes of red words run through my mind DON’T YOU HAVE A START UP TO RUN?? SHOULDN’T YOU BE WORKING?? WHY ARE YOU CHECKING IN TO THE PLACES YOU EAT WHEN YOU CLEARLY DO , EAT??? I calm down just in time for my roommate to make his 3rd airport stop of the day, in his big black rented un-tinted van ,My roommate has a friend visiting in the front seat, who much to my dismay immediately started discussing whether clicking and selecting additional locations in “foursquare” will give her “points” or not. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? DOES IT REALLY MATTER?? It struck me that just like that horrible child screaming endlessly on the flight I just walked off of minutes ago, these people’s personal technology was not only making the trivial details of their lives more accessible but it was actually making their lives more open and vulnerable ,I really feel like the advances of technology have given people so much time back since the days of the massively slow desktop computers that we are frantically trying to make up for time gained by filling it with remedial tasks which we THINK enhance our lives but really just packs it full of meaningless drivel in the form of #hashtags and @mentions, likes, hearts, tags, reblogs, and checking in via squares, faces and the most recent GOOGLE fucking PLUS +++,▲▲▲▲▲▲▲,Who says cool and causal isn’t chic? Check out these hauties – they show us Bushwick street fashion is about slouchy clothes, stripes, dots, and necessary accessories. Color is simple, style is great, attitude is amazing. This is summer in Brooklyn – Bushwick style.,950 Hart is relatively new to the Bushwick art scene, but they’ve been incredibly busy. In less than a year, they’ve put on seven shows in their space, plus one off-site. Their current exhibit is “,,” and when I went to the opening, it was pleasantly busy, and several of the artists were there to talk about their work. The gallery is on two levels, and in the basement they’ve got a permanent collection, featuring work from three of the space’s four founders: Michael Kronenberg, ,, and ,. Sean Alday, the fourth member of the team, is a writer, blogger, videographer, and unofficial gallery historian. Everyone I met was welcoming and warm, and eager to share their excitement about the project.,: Do either of you have any prior curating experience?,: All I’ve really done is construction and gardening; I learned how to make things lovely through construction, and then with gardening I learned how to put things in the right order. I did a lot of Zen gardening, so my first curating experience was making a little garden on the side of a hill. Then I got here, and I realized it’s another little garden on a hill, and it just needed to be cultivated.,: Sean’s being modest; he’s actually been a godsend. He’s incredibly brilliant and very motivated, and super at coordinating and reaching out to people. He also has a really good idea of what he wants to do and a great eye for new talent.,: What made you decide to start a gallery?,: We’re acquainted with a pretty large circle of creative, talented artists, and we wanted to try to get more exposure for them. We started talking about starting a gallery when we were all hanging out. Mikki and I were making art, and Sean was writing and video-documenting everything.,: And Antoinette went out and got four panels and started meticulously crafting the checkerboard pieces that are now in the permanent collection. She worked on the piece for about a month straight. Every time I came by, she was working on it. It’s a very good vindication of the enthusiasm we had about doing this, and it kind of became the reason we were doing it, because everyone was so excited about it. And we all fed off of the excitement; there was no way not to.,: I also want to give a big shout-out too to Grant Stoops, from ,. He’s the one who talked me into actually showing my stuff for the first time, and now we’ve got some of his pieces in our permanent collection, too. It’s great synergy.,Read the rest of the interview at ,., has its own , where local farmers sell beautiful red tomatoes tasting like childhood; fresh onions that make your eye tear when you cut it, green parsley, yellow pumpkins, different kinds of honey from intensely sweet dark brown honey to light orange honey…,The market is open on Saturdays from 9am to 5pm by ,, and on Wednesdays from 9am to 5pm at ,.,The products not only taste good, but they are also pretty photogenic….","

It’s flying that high so Marylin Monroe’s, looks like a fat chicken attempting to fly in comparison with an eagle. Thanks to my skirt, or should I say, thanks to the sudden lack of it, a couple of truck drivers immediately start to believe that the world is a better place… But I look around in fear, because the , because she was biking in a skirt pops up in my mind right away…  “Pheww….” Luckily, there are no cops around.,There is a happy ending to The Flying Skirt on BQE story, but I learned a lesson: To be able to select proper clothing and accessories when riding a bike (which is always), I need higher education in math, textile materials, and meteorology. How otherwise would I be able to calculate the optimal speed to ride a bike without my skirt blowing?  Well, I don’t have a degree in math, but luckily ,, which gave me enough background to create this formula for calculation of the optimal speed, i.e. the speed, at which your skirt stays in place and doesn’t fly around…,Where, is the optimal speed. , is the distance you want to bike, and , is the length of your skirt.,Simple right?!,

There are items and ideas that are public knowledge, usually since their patent has expired or has existed before the process of patents. The chastity belt for example.

The sound coming out the speakers is as wholesome as only the sound coming out of a quality 90s stereo can be.  ,, Bushwick writer, proudly turns the volume button to the right. “,,” he says. We’re in his , at the same time.  Paul has recently , come to the attention of public: this time by an online release of an , called ,. Paul authored all three parts of the story, the main character of which is You;  read it; composed the music to enhance the effect of this ‘almost cataclysmic’ story; and his buddy musician Roarke Menzies recorded and mixed it. The first two parts were released in June and July, and the final installment is prepared for August.,“The You Trilogy is kind of a social experiment…” says Paul while turning on his keyboard. “Originally, I wanted to release it on a record, but Roarke persuaded me that an online release would be better. Now I want to see how far an audio play like this can reach. Its length is also important; it’s not a 5-minute long play. Every part is 30 minutes long. ”,I’m convinced that Paul must be a great musician taking into account how sensitively he composed the music to most of his audio achievements. Paul protests, insisting that he only has this huge keyboard, and sometimes he presses a button here… and a button there, and a couple of keys like this….and suddenly… “Oh, do you recognize? This is the bossa nova background music from The Game, the first part of The You Trilogy.” asks Paul clearly entertained by the musical part. Paul explains that music is a very powerful tool to accompany a text. “Maybe even too powerful….” Paul makes a mystical face.,Another artifact in Paul’s proud possession is a 90s cassette player. “I got it from a friend, it was just sitting on a shelf, and she thought it doesn’t work.” Paul is rewinding a cassette. “But it does, and actually I used it during the Bushwack Series at The Bushwick Starr.”,Paul’s fascination with audio formats comes from his childhood, when his parents used to listen to plays on the radio. He says he didn’t like radio plays back then; it was only a bit later when he started to specifically write compact pieces to be read out aloud. Theater plays are too complicated. You need to many people, too many resources… it’s a way serious thing.,By day Paul works at Wycoff Starr, and by night he writes, composes or records. Paul’s readings became largely visited, because of how close to a performance they actually are.

In fact, I think the world at large functions based on this principle of persuasion. Yesterday I, as well as a number of my professional colleagues received an email offer from a young man, to consume a significant, but small portion of his flesh. My initial response was, “What?”, ,, I simply did not undersand what he was asking for. Due to this, my second response was, “You better call me right now, because I am not wasting another minute of my time looking up these terms!”, which I was actually doing immediately after sending my response. Unfortunately, my web browsing was simultaneous with his email checking, and my phone rang the second my eyes hit the sentence containing the words “long pig” in ,.,I picked up my mystery call, hoping against hope, but knowing, that the man on the other end of the proverbial line, would not be the one who wanted to be eaten. My hope , fell short – it was him.,My general rule for phone calls is it must be under 3 minutes, or the client is clearly taking advantage of my time. However, due to this inexplicable fantasy, and my endless quest for knowledge and proof of freudian psychological theories, this phone call ended one long hour later, with me laughing – and stupefied. He had answers to questions I had no time to pose, which with him being a lawyer, mostly consisted of a legal approach to the situation which can only be categorized as consensual, and non-fatal.,The outcome was for me to meet with him, weekly, for about a year, in order to further explore his quest – to be eaten. These meetings, and my time would , be compensated as to not feel cheated if in 4 months or so I found him distasteful ,; this I explained using the argument: “Who wants to eat a jerk?” I surprised myself at having such sound points to my debate, as juvenile and amateur as they must have sounded to a legal professional who had written his senior undergrad thesis on his particular fantasy being a covert, worldwide practice ,! Our first meeting was arranged for tomorrow ,, but true to his values – and my promise – where monetary compensation is considered secondary to our mutual goal, I decided to forgo what would would have been a paid hour of my time spent with him, in favor of yoga – which I thought would bring some balance to my recent choices in occupation. Our first meeting is pending to be rescheduled, and so is the outcome. SUSPENSE and maybe some terror.,Stay tuned.,▲▲▲▲▲▲▲","

Thick fat raindrops here and there should have been a warning enough before this summer mayhem.,“This won’t last more than 20 minutes.” Ty says. “It took me a while to figure out New York summer rain. But it’s always like that.” California surfer continues.,Ty halfway closes the large gate of his studio, and covers up a dresser made of smooth massive wood, his latest commission, so that the intense rain doesn’t damage it.,Dry Bushwick dust mixes with the water pouring from the sky and creates distinctive summer smell; I hug my knees, finding a seat on an upholstered chair, while Ty lights up his welder to finish the works on some kind of an iron component.,Ty’s studio is filled with artifacts of all kinds: from a Snow white’s dwarf, to screws, pipes, and plastic cups of all sizes. A big caste recorder in the corner is producing strange installation of sounds. Ty likes to listen to an experimental college radio. He says that sometimes they play songs, but he prefers strange sounds in the background, he doesn’t need a tune.,Ty says that ever since he remembers, he has been collecting strange things and peculiar objects. Back in California, he would fill up his vintage car with found objects, like bottle cups of different colors, figures, or shells…  Ty uses his skills to assemble bigger and smaller objects together creating unexpected shapes and sculptures.  He encourages me to climb up an iron shelve on the wall, and take a look at his studio from the s bird’s-eye view. Ty explains he loves to look at the studio from above. I take couple of pictures. It’s strange to see his huge sculpture that just recently dominated Vandervoort Pl. as part of the ,, so closely. The sculpture looks a little trapped in between four walls of Ty’s studio. We both agree that that the sculpture needs to breathe and looks better on the street. On the other hand, I am glad that I can observe the sculpture closely, and I am realizing the various components it’s made of: Ty’s daughter’s old toys and baby equipment, caps from the rolls of print paper from a friend… The sculpture is white and baby pink; and resembles a fantasy animal.,Ty is a cheerful guy with piercing lively eyes, who lives in the magical world where the most ordinary things find their place together and come to life. Moreover, he is an incredibly skilled craftsman. We’re walking through an apartment connected to Ty’s studio. Ty has furnished it with objects he has made of metal, steel and wood: level bed, kitchen sink, and solid wooden shelf firmly holding on the wall….,Just like Ty said the tropical Bushwick rain magically stops after 20 minutes; the air is fresh and instantly warm; the rays of light reflect from a wet bamboo palm in his backyard…,Enjoy the , with our friends BirdDog Productions and RethinkPopMusic who are bringing ,, featuring more than a dozen bands and free booze., will take place in ,.

When living in the suburbs I would be on a daily manic swing from mild comfort to extreme paranoia of being in the proximity of my sworn enemies. In the spring, when the air would burst with speckles of their wretched offspring, my attempts to condition my response to the creatures would involve me inching closer to them and killing the smaller ones with my fingertip , as I laughed, maniacally. As the summer turned cold and the air filled with decaying leaves, only the hearty and stout of the species would hide among the foliage, among the folds of my clothes, and in my closet – where I grew decorative plants. My interactions with the things would lessen, I would forget to stay upon my toes; relinquishing my mental domain over their kind. They would appear when least expected, in the photos of biology books, at which I would shriek and drop loudly – my mind going to a place much like my mind goes to now when one of those U-Haul trucks rolls by with a giant green spider on it, the size likening it to be more like a squid.,Writing the paragraph, having to recall those visual experiences and my physical reactions to them has now caused me , to become hyper sensitive, causing my nerve ends to tingle as if I had small insects crawling on me, and my heart to palpitate far too rapidly for comfort., organization tell me that if I do not alter my lifestyle in order to avoid the thing that I fear most – ie. live in the city, far away from my “animal phobia” – I need not worry. But considering my knowledge of such a phobia and my choice in moving to a city, after living in a city, after living in the suburbs and traveling through rural areas ,, I would have to admit that my lifestyle was altered in a much grander sense than just staying indoors. Luckily I also happen to prefer city life socially, so my fear has yet to present a problem – other than when I agree to go camping for the first time in years.

DJ Bird Dog is simply rad….,, a director of ,, ,, presents a kaleidoscopic portrait of the organization through 10 compact art exhibitions, to open every summer Friday, starting tomorrow with Ivan Argote.,Marco explains that shortly after he was hired by NURTUREart as a director early this year, he was challenged with the planning of the sequel to the  Bushwick Biennal. Two years ago NURTUREart threw more of a macro event, a survey of Bushwick, and its art spaces. Marco wanted to change the format, and instead of asking ,, to ask ,t,  as an organization. The poster for the show is an empty template saying: , to be filled out by the participating artists.,10 summer weeks, that is 10 summer Fridays night openings at NURTUREart. Every week there will be some one else. Marco says that it’s like an identity game played with artists, curators, and other organizations. NURTUREart is hanging over the keys to these people and will let them speak for them. Each of the Friday shows will be completely original. Marco sees , more like a festival than a series of traditional shows. He uses the word workshop a  lot.,The gallery will be open to the public already on Thursday, on the day before the opening. The public can come in and see the installation in progress, as NURTUREart belives that it’s important to see the hands on the work.,The only connecting factor of the 10 shows is diversity. NURTUREart pledged to show the panorama of the art being created in New York; to present an idea in a nutshell: going from crazy, odd or weird, to conceptual, minimal, and hyper-educated.,The shows are very improptu, the budget for one traditional NURTUREart show was split into 10. Marco says that it will be an outlet for creativity.,When you go to NURTUREart tomorrow (or even today) make sure to grab one of the brochures. The brochures were produced in Berlin, by a machine called RISOgraph, which uses color soya beans. The machine is completely cold, and uses 95% less energy than normal machine.  It’s hand-bound, and each one is a little different than the other.,The list of invited artists, curators and organizations includes:,
IVAN ARGOTE/ IAN PEDIGO/ MIGUEL AMADO/ CHELSEA HAINES AND ERIOLA PIRA/,
FORTRESS TO SOLITUDE/ RACHEL BUDDE/ FAMOUS ACCOUNTANTS/ REGINA REX/,
JONATHAN EHRENBERG/ RYAN KITSON,
,About a month ago, shortly before we hung the works of Tuesday People at Curb and Stoops, I accepted the invitation to visit the studio of ,, cult photographer, Bushwick celebrity, and one of the 14 artists participating in this show. He told us how he met painter,, his creative buddie in this project; how he attempted to scare her to death with his crazy email; and how eventually this encounter made him think about his artistic expression as a photographer. I recorded our discussion, and you can watch it right here:,At the time of our interview, Rafael hadn’t seen the work of Alicia Papanek for the show yet, and suggested that the first email he sent to her in order to see if it scares her, becomes a part of the show… What he didn’t know was that Alicia experimenting with topography at the time, already made this happen… She had the email carved with a laser into wood, making the email part of the exhibition.,

I had never considered , as a positive attribute ,, but I was starting to understand where my friend was coming from. Manipulating clients, in a service based industry to have more pleasant conversation while you are working, by avoiding certain topics of conversation – can at times, by some people, be considered in-genuine and manipulative. However, having a combined 20 years of experience in service based industries, we had come to an executive decision. It is important to change and adapt to your environment in order to survive.,The topic then turned to friends who had made careers from the practice of psychological manipulation, and the men who provide the outlet. I had heard of “sugar daddies” in passing, and even the website which exist as a forum for communication,. They are real – so real in fact that a friend of my brunch-mate’s had found, and was currently some old rich dude’s platonic “sugar babe.” I was stunned. Is it really that easy?,There I was, thinking I had to work for a living, trying hard to dress well and schmooze with the right people, gauging potential clients and customers. It’s all the same: table service, design, art consultation, flagellation.,It turns out, it’s just as much work as everything else. The girl had gone on many interview dates, no doubt with countless offensive ,. Some may say she was lucky to find a gentleman happy to support her, others would just call her , a manipulative gold digger who was in it to win it. I wish I knew her, so I could pick her brain. Instead, I did the next best thing by joining a couple of the sites.

It is June 1959 in Brooklyn, your husband is at work, and your kid presumably stopped shrieking for a sweet moment.  Lean comfortably back in your chair, I hope your feet are resting on a couch too, yes, that’s nice. Lit up your cigarette, ,, take a deep breath, exhale slowly… yes, nice smoke circles, and, get ready, because today we’re cooking ,, with our one and only, the charming ,!,Toxic candy sculptures are great for you and your child! After consumption of the candy sculptures, your skin will be shiny, your hands will be smooth, and your child will outshine the neighbor’s kid for sure! So don’t hesitate and cook with Ben Godward today!,:,-         a mixing spoon,-         a plastic cup,-         a bucket,-         an empty beer can,:,-         Rigid Urethane Foam,-         Pigments of various colors,-         Resin for glazing,Now you’re ready to start. First, put on your gloves. Ben adds instantly an amusing story from his own toxic candy sculpture practice, how he once forgot to put on the gloves and his hands ended up covered in pink warm foam. He had to wait until the foam got dry and peel it off after.,Carefully place the plastic cup on the floor. What? Your baby just woke up and is crawling towards the bucket of rigid urethane foam? Quick, before your baby eats all of it, pour some into the plastic cup. Babies love urethane foam in the liquid state and it’s good for them, but remember, safe some urethane for later too!,Observe how the said toxic mixture grows in the plastic cup and enjoy its sudden warmth. Your baby is clapping of joy? I know… They always do…,By now the mixture should have changed into a smooth foam of flashy hot pink color. Way better  than mother nature could ever think of, right? Now,  apply the foam onto a prepared tower of a bucket and a beer can.,Beautiful, isn’t it?,Well, but we’re not quite finished yet! It wouldn’t be a proper toxic candy sculpture without some hot pink glazing. Apply some Resin for pure perfection…,And now you only have to wait until the foam dries up. And that’s not a very long time thanks to its friendly chemical formula! Win win situation for everybody!,Once the toxic candy sculpture dries up, consume it quickly and in large doses together with your entire family!,I hope you enjoyed cooking with our master chef Ben Godward!,…oh, and did I mention your condo.. is ugly?,Elli Perry.

,It’s really hard to find a suitable label for, , because she is a woman of multiple talents. She is a painter, illustrator, but also a writer. She gladly accepts the role of muse to many artists, and is frequetly being painted or photographed. Furthermore, Kat, as an offspring of European gipsies, posses certain psychic abilities, and is known for her tarot card readings. That’s what seemed the most fascinating to Veng, who decided to portray 3 tarot cards, one for past, one for present, and one for future. When I asked if Katelan read tarot for Veng,  he said no, because he was too scared. That’s probably why Veng made up his own version of tarot… I mean… Insect Fool?

For more of The Bushwick Chronicles, check Bushwick Daily next Thursday.,A middle school friend once quoted most likely something her older sister once said, “moving is only second in stress, to childbirth.”,I never understood that statement to be true, however at this moment in time, it find that comparison to be particularly valid. Allow me to elaborate on my personal experience of the last 2 weeks; moving is like dating – minus the sexy time. Like… dating because you are old, lonely and want to have babies, right now. Not fun dating because you want to experiment with multiple partners. Even my roommate, who too is looking to acquire a new place a residences, confronted our first housing mistress by telling her it felt like he was on a blind date all of a sudden, to which she replied that it felt more like speed dating to her. [Luckily neither my roommate, nor I have experience enough to confirm or deny her opinion].,Every time I find a seemingly perfect location online and inquire, I find out it’s unavailable. Just when I think I think I have found a perfect location, it’s much too distant. When you think you have found something reasonable, a gem in the rough, you find out it’s cheap for a reason. The five floor walk ups, the half mile hike to the subway, the perfect pair of floor that’s just too deep in the ghetto, the second bedroom that’s just a glorified closet. Is this a good analogy for why gals go back to their abusive boyfriends? I never thought I would say 8.5 of these 9 words in the same sentence, but: I just want to settle down with someplace nice. Is this old abusive, cheap, gorgeous, bastard of a home really all that bad? All I have to do is think of the heating bill [that's right folks, I am forced to pay my own heat] and I become re-inspired to hit the field again; to pick up the old shovel and start digging through all the bullshit once again, hoping this time I don’t get stood-up, double crossed or in a fight with a hasid.,▼▼▼▼▼▼▼,This column has been brought to you by: Detox Yogi tea and a lemon sugar cookie, both from Mr. Kiwi, which I will miss much if I must leave the neighborhood.,▲▲▲▲▲▲▲,“Enough of the hypothetical duck talk,” I said, and ,raised his eye-brows. It was one of the Bushwick gallery nights, and we were slowly melting our intellectual gallery experience immediately preceding this moment, in one of the number of kinds of the Six Point beer.,Eric is probably , in Bushwick, known for his ,, ,, ,, ,, and as of lately, well, because of ,….,Thanks to the super cool ducks that Eric has been painting lately, he received ,of ,, maybe even a bit too much, because now he might be expected to have commited to this specific poultry kind…  ,“What if I want to paint something other than ducks?” says Eric in a short moment of hesitation when we’re walking on Broadway towards the,, the only place with real ducks in Bushwick, as far as I know. But the hesitation dissolves quickly, because Eric is pretty excited about all the props that he’s carrying in his backpack. He has a loaf of bread, cookie cutters, yellow rubber ducks, and a stick, to which I refer as a Gandalf stick, but Eric dismisses this reference with an annoyed ‘pff’. Eric is planning a sacred duck ritual at the farm, he says he has a vision that he will cover himself up with strangely cut out pieces of bread, and the ducks will eat the bread off him. I am cracking up because of the reference to last week’s article about ,, but I am also a little concerned, because there are only 2 ducks at the farm and about a million of shameless chickens…,At the farm, both of the aforementioned ducks are chilling in the shade, not caring too much about what’s going on around them; they only make an annoyed , whenever a chicken tries to drink from their water. Eric’s eyes sparkle when he realizes that his totem animal is a little aloof, just like in his paintings. Masha from the farm, however, strictly forbids us to feed the ducks any bread, because it’s not good for them, she says. She suggests we give them bananas. Also it’s starting to be pretty clear that we’re not getting rid of the chickens any time soon. They are following us around as we’re following around the ducks; and furthermore, Silky, a white, innocent-looking Chinese rooster attacks Eric. Eric says that it was a charming attack indeed, and Masha explains that Silky had so much sex lately with all the chickens, and now he thinks he’s the shit. Generally, there is way more fuzz and chaos among the poultry than normally, and many of them have large featherless parts on their bodies. It seems like there were some kind of riots going on. Eric inquires about this with Masha, who promptly responds that spring caused the roosters to be over-sexing the chickens. “Mainly the fat ones,” she says. “We had to isolate all the roosters except Silky.” Eric asks me to specifically mention the chicken sex riots in this article., , , , ,I hope your weekend was at the very least,. And I bet it was, if you, like me didn’t resist the temptation to check out all the festivities going on in Williamsburg and Greenpoint under the umbrella of, and ,.,The following are photos taken on Saturday afternoon in , where ,played. The atmosphere was really chilled, the people were having fun, drinking beer, listening to the bands, and the coolest kids around were naturally kids from Bushwick.,Oh, and Courtney Love made an appearance during the Wavves’ performance. I could have taken a photo of her, if I paid more attention to strangers talking to me and were not deaf. Like that girl who approached me and yelled into my ear: “Look Courtney Love!! Take a picture!” And my deaf self goes like: “What do you mean by love? How can I take a picture of love?” The girl just rolls her eyes and Courtney is gone… In any case, I don’t have a photo of Courtney, but I have a whole bunch of awesome photos of people who came to the concert, and had the best time.

"“I’ve always had this fantasy!” says ,as I am closing a small gate entering her small brown house in Williamsburg. The air is hot and steamy; it stopped raining only minutes ago. The Brooklyn flora absorbed the moist hastingly, as if it knew that the upcoming months will not bring anything else than hot wind and burning concrete. The summer in Brooklyn is approaching quickly.,“I want my paintings all over myself, all over the place. Everywhere!”, says Julie with a sparkle in her eye. She is explaining on the porch, and as we’re walking up her stairs. I’m thinking that the concept is perfect; it matches with the exact precision Julie’s personality. Julie makes abstract paintings in vibrant colors; she’s quick and paints in the heat of the moment, inspiration being her fuel and radiation of energy a necessary by-product.,Julie’s living room is a joyful and creative mess. Tubes of paint, paint brushes, sketch books, sheets of paper, and hundreds of paintings painted on all kinds of materials, like a piece I pick painted on an envelope…,Julie and I begin to hang the paintings on the ceiling, and to spread them on the floor, creating a projection of Julie’s inner world in her living room. “I only want to make paintings. And look at paintings” I remember Julie once telling me.,Thousands of threads of paint have dried dripping on the wall where Julie paints.,She started to hang out in Bushwick about a year and half ago and barely missed a single art opening. “Since I came to Bushwick, everything changed. I found friends. And community. I know I can’t go wrong, I can’t fall, because they won’t let me. And it may sound like a cliché, but that’s something I’ve never had before. I finally feel like I belong somewhere.” says Julie. “I am incredibly thankful for that.”,Julie is sitting on the floor, just starting a new painting. She makes two blue lines, than goes for some yellow and red. I’m asking her to pose a little, but she says I have to wait because this looks like a good one.,Being with Julie feels like recharging your creative energy. The air she’s surrounded with, buzzes, I swear. She has organized and curated a number of notable events and creative-people-get-togethers. Like the ,a couple of weeks ago at the Hyperallergic headquarters. She was painting for 24 hours aiming to make 100 paintings. The first 100 visitors got a free piece. She will be doing ,for Northside Open Studios, and will paint for 5 hours this Sunday from 12 to 5 at India Street.,Recently, Julie came to the attention of public thanks to organizing an informal ‘drink ‘n’ draw’ sessions throughout the course of 9 weeks and bringing together 45 artists. These sessions resulted in 100 collaborative and experimental pieces and a big art party at ,during Bushwick Open Studios. The show is called “So Happy Together” and the pieces are still on sale for as little as $ 50, thus making art accessible even to a regular Bushwick resident. You should definitely check out the ,at Norte Maar on June 26.,“Though dreams can be deceiving, like faces are to hearts, they serve for sweet relieving, when fantasy and reality lie too far apart.”,Fiona Apple’s lyrics rang in my ears on so many mornings when waking, it became a sort of intro anthem to my morning rituals, setting off the reset of the day in a comfortable fog of yearning to be back in my other worlds where I live out my tumultuous and often confusing dreams.,I have tried to understand where my dreams lie; if they are truly lucid, or if they if I just have dream control. As it seems my dream self acts within the dream world as I act within mine – with total understand and comprehension that nothing is as it seems and that reality is fluid, forever changing like layers of marbled pigments suspended between water and oil, shifting within a million currents.,In the last year, I have gone so far as to put on makeup in a kiosk mirror at an outdoor beauty pageant, pick the lint off the shoulder of my anonymous lover, convince club kid party scenesters I am relevant via my fat friend who is Marilyn Manson or 19 year old Rick Owens. But the worst is when everything is going swimingly in the dream, and I wake up to pee or take a phone call, go back to sleep and bring back a piece of waking rationality or consciousness. All of a sudden, I have ethical dilemas to face and emotional heralds to leap – logistics just don’t line up anymore. I struggle on for an hour or two, certain I can fix this sudden turn in events, but I never can. I wake up just a touch frustrated, knowing I had let a litteral dream slip right through my fingers. I stagger through reality thinking on how I can secure it next time, but in real life. After all, I just had it close enough to touch, smell and taste.,Lucid dreaming, the ultimate tease.,[ In my searches for answer I found , cute tests for dream control.

, from , on ,., from , on ,.,Despite my early intrigues in not only BDSM and fetishism, but also borderline vanilla fantasies , I had little desire to explore the visual world of pornography. It is true that I occasionally had fantasies of creating it, starring in it, distributing it , but never in the studio feature sense. Every time I would see deemed pornographic in nature, I would first be disgusted by the blatant display of the human body with little thought as to lighting, concept or artistic integrity that is the human form. Then, after my eyes were drawn back to the image like curiosity to a car crash, I would study the image or images before me, waiting for the arousal that never came. Soon I would grow bored, and occasionally sleepy, exhausted by the tease and denial of something many others come to experience when absorbed in the viewing of naked bodies hovering on the edges of cheap wood prop desks or grinding together at the hips on a hotel bed. As my trial and error methods wore on, I noticed how many of the higher budget features employed actresses who were so tan, bleached and plumbed with silicone, they hardly resembled human bodies. Still, there were a couple diamonds in the rough. Last Tango In Paris , and Cafe Flesh , where two stables in my scant library of tolerable fantasies. But who can sit through so much conversation and plot when they just need some late night inspiration?,I started looking through the backs of old forgotten video rental stores, and stopping at Luv Boutique on my way through Connecticut. I was on a mission to get something raunchy, yet captivating. “‘Clown Fuckers BIG DICK get on the party bus! get ready to enter the FREAKSHOW,’ seemed like a really good option” said the sales rep , “I wouldn’t recommend the sequel” she commented as my glanced bounced between the two DVD covers. Had I looked at the bottom right hand corner of the case, I would have noticed that there are 4hrs of entertainment contained on this single disk. NO ONE can sustain a plot for 4hrs when it involves sex ,The first scene was great, low budget and simple ,. I thought the zombie cave man really brought it together.,The second scene was a little less creative, but equally as imaginative. With a fantasy lover appearing before the girl, soon turning into evil doppelganger robot with blue ooze/lube for brains that he kept smearing the girl with. It was definitely more on the humiliation side of role play.,The third scene was some younger girl with an older balding dude that maybe was supposed to be her dad, an older lady with a strap on and white face paint that was definitely and convincingly supposed to be her mom, and a forth character who appeared while I was fast forwarding. It was less sexy than it was disturbing.,After this last , , scene, the next 3hrs of fornication turned into 8 vignettes, all following the same layout : intro,, oral, vaginal, anal, facial. I forward through all of them, figured I might have missed some strange verbal sentiments and spot checked the scenes front to back once again. Despite my totally sleepy and misanthropic state, I began to relate to these amateurs with bad skin, piles of makeup, small breasts and shapely figues. In them, I saw my middle school self, unconfident, shy, and excited to have really boring sex. I wish I had given porn a shot back then. To know that underneath the clothes and attitude we all look quite similar, would have given me great confidence back then. I wish the government wouldn’t prohibit our basic privilege to know we are all the same.,Exercise of the week: make a porn, give it to a friend. ,▼▼▼▼▼▼▼,This week’s column was brought to you by:,

,Photo by courtesy of Elle and Andrea,Missing a little bit of film in the , program? Don’t miss anymore and head to , where , is organizing a ,l featuring works of Bushwick filmmakers.,At 4 Charles Place, at Myrtle Ave, between Bushwick & Evergreen. We are right beside the  coffee shop Little Skips.,We are an art space devoted to film and video makers, sound, performers and other time-based artists. We present month-long exhibitions and a twice-a-week event series of screenings, performances and music shows from emerging to internationally recognized artists, including those we represent. We are always, however, seeking new discoveries, and accept submissions.,Yes, we are!  Our gallery is open all three days from 1-6PM.  Our current exhibit is “SU FREDRICH re:working”. This is Friedrich’s first gallery show, but she’s been making films for 37 years and shows them worldwide  The show reveals the work behind the work. She started as a photographer. The exhibit includes all these early photographs that she hasn’t shown before,  her work journals where she details every single frame, things she made as props, these beautiful new black & white filmstrip prints, digital collage from her recent videos,and films of course. There are over 175 works on the walls. Very different than our other shows.,Also, we’ve curated a film festival. One night at an opening here, Tara Ferri came in and asked if we wanted to organize a film festival for BOS 2011 in connection with her Music Festival. And we said, “Sure”.,
And here we are. It’s this weekend, the first BOS Film Festival.  We are presenting 5 programs of films, video & performance each day, starting at 6PM – SHARP – to 10. We’ve got some great artists and all the programs are free. It’s in the Backroom at Goodbye Blue Monday. The full program and other details are available at:   ,.,
We’re not really brunch people. We usually get very hungry around 7pm, and we run to the little grocery deli just around the corner on Myrtle for tacos, vegetable (w/ cactus!) or beef. They’re really good, especially the avocado sauce, and they’re also the cheapest around!,“,“, says ,left behind by , on a fence on ,. The piece was placed right at the topographical boarder between , and ,. , of Skewville says that the grass in Bushwick isn’t greener than the grass in East Williamsburg. And I confirm. Mainly because there ain’t any…. Yet…,However, Ad, as the master mind behind the idea of Bushwick Art Park, is promising some greener times pretty soon. Ad has been intrigued by an under-used street right behind Factory Fresh, for quite some time now.  On Saturday June 4th, as part of ,, Vandervoort Place will be turned into a street-inspired public art park featuring statues of acclaimed Brooklyn artists.,The prototype art park curated by ,director Ali Ha, was introduced earlier in May at The Festival of Ideas for the New City StreetFest.,It’s funny that you mention that… If you go to the history section of ,, you will see the house where my brother Droo and I first moved to. It was a crooked building in Queens that we called ,, simply because it was crooked.  It was right this color scheme: brigh orange, red, green, kinda bodega style. We collected a lot of toys and vintage items, because we liked that style. When people come down here (,), they see that this place is sort of a replica of the crooked house in Queens. Many items are from there: the clock, the soda, the drawers.,People soon started to say:  “We’re hanging out at Skewville, come to Skewville, …” This is how everyone was referring to the building…. Droo and I both quit our jobs to start our own accessories company with t-shirt, and smoking paraphernalia, and we named the company so Skewville. When we started to make our wooden sneakers and street artwork we would become known as Skewville.,Later, my brother and I split and now he runs a company named Skewville too, and the gallery we had at the Lower East Side was called Skewville too….,The whole initiative is actually to de-map the street and have the city make it a park. The street is barely used and I clean it up on daily basis. There is always just trash, condoms, hypodermic needles, broken bottles… Sometimes during the summer you see kids playing ball against the wall… So we took over that one wall that I know the owner and we cleaned up the block. Actually, for this Bushwick Open Studios it’s just a re-lauch, because we had a party there already. It is an ongoing thing… To promote this area and maybe possibly make it happen….,Yeah, and a broken window every month, guaranteed. I’ve been collecting that glass, and there’s a pile of it now…,Some of the artists that did this for the New Museum project: Leon Reid IV, Specter, Skewville and And Bast, a Brooklyn street art legend, is making a surprise visit… He’s making a giant piñata that is going to be hanging above the street. My brother is installing the actual grass down the entire street that says ,. And Veng RWK is painting the entire wall,It is a way for artists really to express themselves and to have a space devoted for that and obviously families and everyone can be involved. It is a community thing and that’s really what’s great about it! Although it may seem shady from me to try to have a place to paint right in my own backyard (, The truth is that it’s definitely better than what is there now and obviously it’s going to help to improve the community, so everyone is welcome!!  As long as they don’t throw trash! (,),Actually, a gallery is funding the material to make it:  all the eye balls from a doll park. Bast has to call them up when he’s done. If they buy it, he’s going to take it away, but if not everyone’s going to smash it! I am not sure what’s going to be inside of it yet….,

And there ain’t no better place on Earth than , to do so…,So let’s see what is there to see this weekend in our beloved hood…, head to see a group art show , from the art kitchen of , at  840 Broadway (at Park Street), 3rd Floor, Bushwick, Brooklyn, 11206 (JMZ to Flushing) from 7pm to 10pm.,After HKJB you should check out , ,the newest of the Bushwick gallery babies! It’s located on 1501 Broadway (off the J Halsey stop).,is holding their , there from 6pm to 1am. All the art has been donated by local artists and it’s for sale! According to what Masha from the Farm told us, the art is pretty awesome and cheap too! So don’t miss your chance to buy something nice for your apartment and support Bushwick City Farm. All the funds will go to support Bushwick City Farm  in a conversion of a vacant lot at Stockton Street that once used to be a spot for crackheads into an organic farm (we wrote about the project yesterday ,). Additionally, there will be live music, food from the farm and fun as always when Bushwick City Farm is involved!  If you miss the Friday show, don’t worry, because the he same goes , too.,And if this is not enough for you, you can still check out the exhibitions that opened ,., has taken over a new vacant lot at , and has been converting it into a little urban farming paradise. Go check it out and stop by at their , on Friday and Saturday from 6pm to 11pm at a brand new Bushwick gallery , (1501 Broadway)…,In the early 90s, growing up in Bushwick, a group of neighborhood kids, their parents and some local officials got together and decided to start up a community garden near the apartment on Garden Street (rather appropriate) where I was raised. Still, I remember getting my hands dirty while planting trees, learning about different types of soil and looking on in awe how we could grow fresh fruits and vegetables on our own–something this city kid had never even dreamed of doing before.,Today, however, they are taking me on a tour of their latest project, the conversion of a 9000 square foot lot on the corner of Stockton Street and Lewis Avenue. The long-neglected lot will become home to their newest farm site, over four times larger than their Broadway location.,As we walk from the Broadway farm to the Stockton site, Masha and Vinny know nearly everyone we pass on the street–local business owners, parents with their children, even the guys hanging out in front of the bodega, and all smile at the sight of these two neighborhood activists and all have something nice to say. This type of interaction illustrates just how much the pair loves and cares for the community and why they take on the countless hours of work needed to convert empty lots into vibrant farms and greenspaces that Bushwick sorely lacks.,It’s why they have food and clothing giveaways every Sunday (you can drop of any unneeded, gently used clothes along with any cooked or uncooked food at the farm on Saturday or Sunday), coordinate ESL classes and organize urban farming workshops. As they explain, while standing where herbs and vegetables will soon be planted, these sorts of projects build sustainable communities where everyone has a stake and a reason to participate. At the end of the day, this becomes more valuable to Bushwick than simply planting a garden.,Perhaps most impressive is that they undertake these projects with no government grants and no corporate sponsors or funding. Community members help out Bushwick City Farms in any way they can, whether it’s volunteering or giving a few dollars. That makes the tasks that much more difficult to complete, which is why they are organizing a fundraiser this weekend, May 27-28 from 6 to 11 pm at the 3rdEye(Sol)ation Gallery (1501 Broadway) featuring local art, refreshments and music. They have also set up a fundraising page at  IOBY, a site that supports local environmental projects (click ,).,So swing by their benefit or, at the very least, donate through the IOBY page so these two can continue the great work they’re doing!,With the conclusion of nearly two year run of a burlesque night I started at Piano’s of the lower east side, came retrospective and perspective.,My original plan was formulated during the first months of my move to Bushwick. I had a couple friends who I had met back in Boston, or traveling to fetish events in NYC and Florida who were involved with parties, art shows, events and performance spaces. I was excited to partner up, utilize as many spaces as possible and grow as a performer. What I did not know was that I seemed to have missed the boat of the burlesque revival by about 10 years or more, and indie performing arts by about 15. I saw the slew of opportunities to , merge all things into ONE. I saw it all in bright lights ,. But maybe more like a conceptual and dark burlesque performance during an art show to start with. One thing lead to another, and while I still have yet to curate a parade of apocalyptic proportions, I managed to produce two parties at three venues over the course of 3 years, with only shades of black lung and a few years off the end of my life to show for it. ,I had become so convinced I was moving forward, so enveloped in the consistency of these events , that I had forgotten to move forward. My greatest fear has been complacency, and here it was, staring right back at me on a weekly, or monthly basis.,Then suddenly, , I became overwhelmed by the dire urge to cut off an atrophied limb, as on a tree, to allow for new branches to sprout in it’s place and for the sun to reach the dead patch of dirt which had been previously obscured by shadows cast down by the thick branches. , I immediately sat down to compose an email to the venue managers ,, “regretfully” announcing my departure from the cliches of yesteryear; moving forward, always forward, to seek out and conquer new movements of dance.,▼▼▼▼▼▼▼,This week’s column was brought to you by:,sleep deprivation ,, The Frankie sandwich from Little Skips, 1 iced soy late, 1 iced black coffee, and an ass load of Haaagen-Dazs vanilla fro-yo ,▲▲▲▲▲▲▲,Amid all the other creative movements in Brooklyn these days, farming is one that’s gaining ground. Brooklynites are farming in gardens (,, ,), on rooftops (,, ,), even in ,! They’re even farming hydroponically—which brings us to Boswyck.,Boswyck Farms is a young company, but they’re doing a ,. Of course they’re growing all manner of vegetables—from artichokes to dill to a dwarf apple tree—and they’re experimenting with new hydroponic systems all the time, including putting some on the roof of the ,. They also do a ton of outreach and projects within the community, like growing lettuce at an institution for adults with mental illness, and bok choy at a food pantry. They also work at schools all over the city, from elementary to high school, as science advisors and guest teachers and workshop leaders, and they even bring high school and college students into the farm as interns. It’s not just for kids, of course—anyone can volunteer.,Before you sign up for a shift, click through for the interview with Lee, Boswyck’s founder on ,.,Together with the bloggers from ,, Bushwick Daily is introducing local artists and spaces getting ready for Bushwick Open Studios. We were curious about the plans of ,, a popular coffee/ creative hang out spot. We chatted with Henry Glucroft. a co-owner of “the home” to many of us…,We’re located at 941 Willoughby.,According to Yelp and Google, we are a café primarily, then an art space and a restaurant. According to me, we are a place for people to come and meet, interact, and exchange ideas… Coffee and some snacks help to support the ability to offer that space to others….,We are! We’re gathering approximately 10 local artists who are also regulars here at Little Skips.  Many of them actually come to the café that often that they are available for coffee interviews. Other artists that are part of the show are people who would come in more often if they lived a little closer. Our artists didn’t necessarily spend their entire lives in Bushwick, but they identify themselves with the Bushwick community and they feel like this is their home. And home for their art.,The country that has no name. (laughter),Make sure you don’t miss Little Skips , when touring Bushwick on the first weekend of June during Bushwick Open Studios ’11!,Surrounded by the city of concrete jungle, one has to appreciate the village feel that , constantly produces… The people here know each other and you learn about things by the , or from cheaply printed ,… So I felt when I was walking underneath the J train tracks, so deep in Bushwick that even the people living off the Bushwick portion of the L train don’t come here too often.,I was headed to a , in a loft at ,, right above the Lone Wolf bar. I learned about the yoga classes from my friend Zuska who actually lives in the loft with her eclectic roommates, ,. While approaching the yellow Lone Wolf sign with the yoga mat under my arm, I realized that also Linda Thach from Little Skips was talking about the donation-based community yoga classes in the neighborhood. The flier on the door said you have to call Kristin or John to be let in, because there are no doorbells. Naturally, the J train started to roar above my head the very second Kristin picked up the phone (and this has been the case ever since then…☺).,It was a Monday and that’s when , teaches ,. I recognized the faces of at least of half of the people attending the class. Some I knew from Little Skips, other from galleries… I saw Louvain, a Bushwick Frenchie, who came wearing jeans, and I meet him at least once a day every day. “You are also here?” he asked me. “Naturally.” I replied laughing.,Buffie teaches yoga in a very gentle manner, ensuring that your 1st yoga steps (or should I say asanas) will be a pleasurable experience.,Kristin Mirabelle, thin and flexible as a ,, was saluting her sun in the first row. I stayed to chat with her and her boyfriend John Kazar after the class was over, to realize how passionate they both were about yoga, spirituality and their service to the Bushwick community. They both were thrilled by all the ideas and the plans for new classes of meditation, home-made cosmetics, all kinds of yoga, and all that, asking only for a modest donation in return. Kristin is a make up artists by day and was in yoga school at that time.  John, who is a photographer by day, traveled the world, and was part of sacred rituals in South America. They are both very proud of their space at 1089 Broadway, which is a large photo-studio by day and a place with a genuinely magical vibe.,Recently, Kristin started to teach yoga every Tuesdays, after years of yoga study and meditation practice. I couldn’t miss it, and after an email blast I went to check it out.,Kristin is determined to provide her students with more than just a work out and her class really is something different. It is a full spiritual experience. She calls it , and she’s not afraid to instruct the class to chant , with her. I was a bit hesitant in the beginning, but praising the moon and the sun energy by the candlelight of Kristin and John’s loft, really has something to it.  Tuesday classes are intermediate, and can be pretty challenging at times, but in return you will find yourself in positions you barely dreamed of, because Kristin individually looks after each of her students and actually makes you go one level up.,
While she walks around the class fixing your neck with aromatic oils, John plays , and other Native American instruments to create amazingly relaxing atmosphere. When the final meditation was over, my mind was , and nothing could possibly change it…, At Boutique Studios at 1089 Broadway, Bushwick, Brooklyn, Monday, Tuesday at 8pm and newly at McCarren Park, rooftop or other outdoor locations, , Definitely , at ,. You will get updates on locations, new classes etc.,If you ever wonder, how it is that you can make yourself stand out from the crowd, I can tell you that it’s by thinking big.,Leigh Bowery wouldn’t leave his apartment without at least a pair of stilettos on, that would clock him in at 7feet tall. Other times he would conceal those same heels in a pair of sneakers to maintain the height, and appearance of a giant fucking man. To top it off, he would also dress in latex, masks, latex masks, and British police hats which would rest on the top of his head. By now, you must be thinking, “I started to read this article because I thought ‘Size Queen’ referred to porn, or was going to help me get noticed,” well… yes, and no.,See, as great as Leigh was, I very much doubt he would have gotten any attention if he wasn’t a 300lb giant. Imagine a brightly dressed man with a mask on , standing 5 and a half feet tall, weighing 150lb. He would look more like a poorly made up clown than the world’s most influential club kid.,Ok, so if we make a list of what to do, and then cross out all the things that short people should not do because they will look like a clown, we get HATS.,There is a reason I have a full wall of hats , While it is true that you will get noticed with more ease with a 6″ boost to your gams, if you are not willing to commit to the daily pain of a strippers life , you might want to consider placing something outstanding atop your head. Uniform hats usually get as much attention as wide brim sun hats, worn at night. If that’s a little too ironic or goth, I suggest trying a Sunday church hat. My old male roommate , looked dashing with a small white box sunday church hat poised on the side of his head, and get this: he was not a gender bender. Which brings me to my next point: clothes are not gender sensitive, mix it up. ,Today’s column was written: with a cat by my side, and not coffee, yet.","

"Bushwick Daily presents ,. Exhibition of 18 artitist featured in ,series:,
,During Bushwick Open Studios ’11 June 3-5,Pre-Opening Party Friday June 3, 7pm-10pm,Curbs & Stoops Active Space (,),
566 Johnson Ave.,
Brooklyn, NY,Sharing ideas, showing your art space and work in progress, making new friends, getting to know the community, enhancing creativity and creative connections, discovering art behind industrial walls, celebrating our home Bushwick and quickly approaching summer…. We simply love the idea of the festival! It is very much in line with what Bushwick Daily is all about. And that’s why we have decided to chip in to the festival madness, bring some fun also offline and create a Bushwick Daily Open Studio. A huge chunk of love is floating to our friends, ,, at 566 Johnson Ave, who were really kind and provided us with a room for the festival weekend.,… and our art show will be 18 times awesome! 18 times multiplied by 2 awesome!,It’s been a good tradition that, every Tuesday, Bushwick Daily brings a feature of an inspirational Bushwick resident or a person with strong Bushwick ties. The idea behind the , series was born sometimes in October 2010, and since then (with a little Xmas break) we have introduced more than 20 awesome people to the rest of the Bushwick community (and the world) through a series of photographs and a story. Musicians, painters, writers, business owners, a psychic, a fashion illustrator, photographers, and more… We have talked about up-and-coming people, but also about stars… Mainly, we wanted to introduce people who are really dedicated to something they love and believe in. We wanted to brighten up the dark moments of creative despair and celebrate the moments of creative explosion…,And now we have asked Tuesday People to create something for our studio! We have paired them up and asked them to create art inspired by the encounter with the other person in their own creative language. Most of the people didn’t know each other before, but we thought they would make great creative buddies.,As a result, Bushwick Daily Studio will feature a surprising, interactive, community driven show, where the boundaries of art forms are not important anymore. Photographers taking photos of painters, painters painting musicians, musicians making music about film makers and more…,Stay tuned for video interviews with the Tuesday People about their mutual meetings and creative outcomes of these meetings….,You can start looking for the works of the following creative pairs:, and , and , and , and , and , and , and ,Only one week after we were celebrating the DIY festival culture of , Loft ,, we have to sadly inform you that tonight is your last chance to experience it. Travis Steward, of Paper Swan collective, informed us that 260 Moore LLC Management with a ‘little help’ of NYPD shut down the Paper Swan Loft after 3 and half years of almost monthly live music events in their living room.,Surprisingly, it wasn’t the neighbors’ complaining about loud music that caused the trouble, it was the graffiti on the walls that the attendees were regularly leaving in the building at 260 Moore.,However, Paper Swan collective continues their production activities outside the loft and additionally, it was allowed to throw one last party in their loft, which takes place tonight. The line up as follows:,cuddle magic • cal folger day • the appleseed collective • scott rudd,Who: ,What: The Last Party at Paper Swan Loft,When: Saturday, May 14,Where: 260 Moore St, #301, from , on ,.,Bushwick Daily, in collaboration with the blog of ,, is bringing you an insight to the Bushwick artists and spaces getting ready for ,.

I am also a fine art large format digital printer and I print for galleries and artists for exhibitions.,Of course I am! Henry Glucroft from Little Skips and I planned together to make Willoughby more artsy, to put it more on the map, because last year nobody really came here. So I decided to split my space here in #503 in half and use half of my space to show my personal work and the collection of art I have accumulated through my printing work in the other half. In addition, in the lobby of my building there is going to be another artist, Twyla Feinbloom and she brands patterns onto leather and sews them onto wood. It’s really cool. So she’ll be downstairs showing and also selling her work.,Hahahaha.

Bushwick Daily has teamed up with Arts in Bushwick, a volunteer organization behind the festival and together we’ll bring you insider look into studios, galleries and cafes.,Stay tuned, because we’ll be interviewing artists, curators, cafes and galleries about their plans!,
							,At the heart and soul of every true artist there is a need. Sometimes that need is a bowl of cereal, other times it happens to be the need for a root canal ,.,Last Thursday I sat with writer, curator and all around artist Shade Rupe, author of Dark Stars Rising and discussed everything from his first interviews at the ripe age of 14 with John Hughes to his more recent encounters with Crispin Glover in Olympia, WA while curating and producing the ,. He has had jobs that range from being a grip on the set of David Lynch’s feature Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, to his current , state of employment as copy editor ,.,After taking in a plethora of film star names of the past and present, and processing a few dates, years, venues and states, the conversation inevitably lead to the present state of freelance artists in this perpetually depressing economy. Naturally, this conversation would occur in The Players club, in a building that predates the 1900s, inside of which some gentlemen predate even the building itself. Regardless of their age, the longevity of the members is trumped by the hefty fee of membership which permits you entry to the building ,. As you can imagine, none of the actual members can remember , being freelance and struggling, much sooner than they care to remember which son they handed their business over to. This all made it a perfect place and time to discuss our outrage at the right-wing healthcare policies, capitalism, and the current economic depression. While sitting at a table of 7 descendants of a wealthy Irish immigrant who was also present, but luckily , deaf, it occurred to me that what makes an artist is not his linear career path, but how much he hates it. There comes a time in every artist’s life when we have to suck it up and go to work for our teeth ,.,♡♡♡♡♡♡♡,Because, just like Shade, his book is seriously awesome.,If you are a cult film nerd, I dare you to read the list of interview subjects below and not cream your pants…,Richard Kern, Alejandro Jodorowksy,,
Buddy Giovinazzo, Udo Kier, Jim VanBebber, Dennis Paoli, Tura Satana, Teller, Divine,,
Brother Theodore, Peter Sotos, Zamora,,
Johannes Schonherr, Chas. Balun,,
Floria Sigismondi, Hermann Nitsch,,
Genesis P-Orridge, William Lustig, Dennis Cooper,,
Gaspar Noe, Johanna Went, The Torture King,,
Andre Lassen, Arnold Drake, Richard Stanley,,
Dame Darcy, Stephen O’Malley, Crispin Glover,If you are not a cult film nerd, this book allegedly contains 500 pictures.,Everything and more about Shade Rupe can be found on his ,.,♡♡♡♡♡♡♡,Fancy a cool vintage outfit purchased in a trailer conveniently parked in front of Roberta’s by any chance anyone? No problem, because in Bushwick, everything is possible…,The fashionable trailer is ran by Tiffany who used to have a vintage clothing store in SoHo, but the rent was just , and she had to close down.  At first, she was really sad about loosing her creative outlet, but on the second thought, she decided to act and find a way!,She filled the trailer with amazing vintage clothes from her store and parked it on the corner of Moore and Bogart. For the moment, she has only female collection, but she plans to start selling men clothes soon. Everything is $20 or less and really awesome! So pay a visit to Tiffany in her fashionable trailer while she’s still in the hood!,On Sunday night, my mind and the minds of my peers in , Loft are peaceful. The girl in red plaid blanket over her shoulders on the couch next to me is hugging her knees. Someone is offering freshly baked tiny pizza cakes from a cardboard box. The famous swan made of paper is almost invisibly bouncing on a string hanging from the ceiling. The last but one band of , just started to play and ,, one of the founders of Paper Swan, a collective of musicians, filmmakers and producers, is sipping his coffee and looking maybe a bit tired, but happy, in any case. He says he loves the sound of the accordion playing. It’s so smooth. I agree.,The Melodica Festival atmosphere has been magical and both bands and attendees are talking about the best weekends of their lives…,Jason and I are walking on High Line, the evening air smells like spring and the sun is touching the Hudson. Jason picked the spot for the photo shoot and I couldn’t be happier about his choice. He’s having fun being the “subject” for a camera for a change. Usually, he’s the one filming. He works as an editor at VH1 and makes 90-second film packages about bands and musicians. He also does interviews and shoots red carpets at events like the Oscars or Grammys. He often writes the scripts, directs, and edits the footage for the clips. Through his work he has met many inspiring people like Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono and Dave Matthews. Quite an enjoyable day job, I have to say.,As always, I am curious about the beginnings of all great ideas and I am demanding the full Paper Swan story from Jason while he’s pulling out his harmonica. Jason is talking a lot about his friend Travis Steward, whom he has known since he was a kid in Cleveland, OH. According to Jason, Travis is a prodigy musician, awesome guy, and a super-positive collective member. Three years ago, they have developed the idea to rent a loft together with a bunch of musician friends to live there, play music, learn and inspire each other. They wanted to get to know the local music scene and to support it through organization of live music events, right there in their living room at 260 Moore Street in Bushwick. They have become so good at it over the time that they are able to organize a festival, virtually, in a blink of an eye. Also they have been asked to host a bunch of music events at Union Hall. Jason says that they have learned so much from the community that they are trying to give back. All of their events are free or if there is admission, it goes to charity.,Well, you will never know unless you try… Have you watched , delivered after he received TED award? Well, , has made quite a difference…,It all began in Paris where he pasted large close up portraits of young people growing up in the Parisian housing projects and pasted them on Champs-Élysées and other bourgeois corners in Paris… JR says he only had a 28mm lens at that time so he had to stand really close to the photographed person and create mutual trust with them. This project called “Portraits of a Generation” made a huge impact and JR decided to continue in other countries as well.,For example he went to Israel to see on his own whether Israelis and Palestinians are so much different from each other. He took portraits of Israelis and Palestinians doing the same job, like a taxi driver or a lawyer and he had them make a face. Then he pasted the photos next to each other. Most of the people couldn’t tell an Israeli apart from a Palestinian… JR was being told from all sides that it’s impossible to paste these portraits on Israeli-Palestinian Wall. He says that not only it was possible, it was actually quite easy and most of the posters are still in place, untouched.,JR continued to Africa with a project “Women Are Heroes”, in which he highlights the dignity of women who are often targets during conflicts. He has been to Middle East and to Brazilian favelas…,At the end of his speech, JR comes to a conclusion that art can’t change the world… Can’t change the circumstances, BUT can create energy and change the perception, which actually makes art a neutral space to exchange the ideas.,And now he’s asking for our help to take the world Inside Out. He asking us to take a close up black and white portrait of a person (could be even yourself) whose story you’d like to share. JR will send you a poster in return. You should paste the poster on a place where it can have an impact.,And here is how Bushwick comes into play. ,, a local art/creativity/hang out/caffeine spot is coordinating Bushwick group to participate in this global art project. Henry Glucroft from Little Skips says that you should find a person living in Bushwick whose story you’d like to share, take a close up black and white portrait of them and upload it to ,. Use the Bushwick group when uploading the photo and type in the address of Little Skips , as the shipping address for the poster. You can donate $20 in the process, so please do if you can. Make sure to email Little Skips once you have completed the process at ,.,Join us and let’s see if Bushwick can make difference too!,Last week I wrote on the topic of self propelling motivation, being your own boss, and staying tough in the game of independent contractors. So I think today I’m going to bitch about some of the silly things encountered in such lucid environment. I say lucid because the longer you are running your own game, the more difficult it becomes to escape into a reality of comfortable delusions. Chances are, if you , manage to unclench the tight fist reality has grasping your throat, it wont be for long. Whether it’s by way of: dreaming, a tryst in an elevator, a wet dream about a tryst in an elevator, daily coffee highs, annual MDMA highs, thigh highs under construction boots or construction boots on the dance floor every Friday night at a salsa club in Harlem – it will end momentarily, spitting you out face planted onto the grimy floors of responsibility.,Fortunately, my escape comes in waves of simplicity; petting a cat, hand washing my back seam cuban heel stockings, checking the stats on my four websites, posting new listings on Yelp about my websites.,Unfortunately, from the same activities which allow such immersive escape emerges a frustration far beyond the reaches of meditation.,After  posting a listing on Yelp.com, concentrating ever so hard on flushing out my bio, the bio of the company, finding a way to lump everything I do under the usual title of False Aristocracy I hit UPDATE and it was done. I may as well have been skipping down the street glowing with the accomplishment of a most simple task. Not a week passed before I received a phone call from a high pitched voice by the name of Jessie Park. She seemed to be calling with concerns about my posting. I have had plenty of conversations with website and blog editors who I had not paid nor had planned to pay for collaboration, sponsorship, or information; I figured this was another one of those times. Within minutes we were deep into conversation punctuated by her perpetual and endless questions regarding my businesses, what I was aiming for, and how Yelp can help. Her high, flat tone made it impossible to differentiate between excitement, annoyance, positive reinforcement, or forcefulness. I begun to feel very coddled and confident in my descriptions, more so the third time she asked me to describe my positioning statement than the first. After the fourth round of the maternal inquisition, she apologized and said she had to run to a meeting or two, and that it was definitely, absolutely, necessary that we schedule the rest of the conversation for the following week.,When on that scheduled day she called half an hour late, I begun to take her a little less seriously, and when she emailed me to reschedule yet again, I became downright suspicious.,“What was she after anyway? Wouldn’t she have mentioned a particular advertising program with Yelp if she was trying to sell me her soul? Of course she would. Usually media kits come in neat little zip files with pdfs and charts, not annoying high pitched voices on a cold call,” I thought, replying to her email cordially. We had set a new phone date.,Having saved her phone number in my contacts, I was ready for her this third time; I answered in a matching shrillness of pitch. She jumped right into the questions again, now occasionally alluding to advertising. It must have been her lack of full knowledge on the topic which had started and perpetuated this confusion. Advertising is a noun which means: 1. the act or practice of calling public attention to one’s product, service, need, etc., especially by paid announcements in newspapers and magazines, over radio or television, on billboards, etc.: to get more customers by advertising. 2. paid announcements; advertisements. 3. the profession of planning, designing, and writing advertisements.,Having just watched , I was clearly seeing from the perspective of an ad agency, posting advertising in the form of a free listing on Yelp.com. The longer she circled like a vulture over our conversation, spiraling downward towards the carcass of my company, the longer I felt like pray. On her 10th circle around the same four questions I started demanding answers from her. After admitting to being in the sales, and seemingly calling from her home with noisy children screaming in the background, not only did she refuse to give me any solid statistics, demographics or projections, but also refused to quote in the present or send in the future any comprehensive form of media kit stating dollar amont exchanged for increased traffic. Her only excuse was that the numbers are always changing and that I had not told her mine, when in fact I had quoted multiple rates for a variety of projects. I became angry, raising my voice to a volume just under yelling, after which she shrieked, ,Oh, what familiar sentiments fragmented my reality just then, spinning me into a mental vortex of anger, resentment and bloodthirsty rage. I hung up the phone. “you should have asked,” I thought, “ignorant bitch.”,♡ Today’s column was written at Little Skips – office to some, second home to many. ♡","

,Once upon a time there was this amazing place called Bushwick where places like , exist. Paper Swan is a collective of musicians, filmmakers, producers, but mainly friends who moved in to the loft on 260 Moore #301 in Bushwick in 2008 simply because they wanted to play music together, get to know and support the community through organization of Roots and Bluegrass music events. And they were really successful at it! They have a great history of music events in their loft and lately they’ve been asked to host a series of 9 music nights at Union Hall, all the profit of which goes to benefit various charity organizations. (We wrote about the Union Hall events ,.),This weekend Paper Swan is proudly hosting Melodica Accoustic Festival in their Bushwick loft. The guys invited about 20 bands and performers who will start playing at 5pm on Saturday and at 4pm on Sunday.,Melodica Festival is an international music event started by Peter Uhlenbruch in 2007. Its mission is to celebrate local music scenes around the world and to provide an invaluable platform for emerging artists, musicians and songwriters and to develop new creative friendships. The festival currently operates in Melbourne (Australia), Hamburg (Germany), Reykjavik (Iceland), Brighton (UK), Aarhus (Denmark) and newly in Bushwick!,The Swan guys say that even babies like acoustic music and the atmosphere of their loft is truly magical. Additionally, the admission is free.

Many people wrinkle their foreheads and noses in disagreement, when looking at it as if it smelled bad. But if you look closer, your heart has to melt, because this little alien animal has the friendliest soul.,One of the first things you will fall in love with in Bushwick, is the rich street art scene. The walls of the industrial buildings are beautiful and fantasy stimulating. Just walk around! Probably the most lovable of all the pieces around is , on Jefferson and Wycoff. “Bambi is sexy! Bambi painted over the paper birds is adorable”, says everyone. Bambi is the joint work of , and his friends, Broken Crow and Paint Goggles.,Soon enough after you fall in love with Bambi, you can start playing the message game with OverUnder. Look for the folded papers or paper bird tags of OverUnder not only in Bushwick, but also all over Brooklyn and read what he has to say. OverUnder is one of the most philosophical street artists out there:,And many, many more….,He has a strong voice and is not afraid to talk about the current affairs through his art on the walls. Shortly after the terrible natural disaster in Japan, OverUnder, with his friend No Touching Ground, made a large mural on Johnson Avenue called ,, where they urged the public to donate to Japan, even if it meant not being able to pay rent. Helping Hand struck the media strongly and proved that the power of street art is greater than just to making sad industrial buildings pretty.,OverUnder loves , surprising joint work with his peers. Lately, he made a whole bunch of murals with his buddies from Robots Will Kill, a collective that he recently became a part of.,There is certainly something serene about watching OverUnder spray paint on a wall somewhere deep in industrial Bushwick. OverUnder protests when I take photos of him riding around on a tall bike, because that’s too circusy according to him. I have to laugh. Many people stop by to take a snap shot of the newest addition to the Bushwick street art. OverUnder smiles friendly and exchanges a couple of words with a photographic bystander. His buddy , is sitting on a curb on the other side of the road, watching him doing the final touches on the wall. OverUnder’s girlfriend comes by just before the sun starts to set, and we’re all laughing when OverUnder misspells his own tag at the end of the day.,Read OverUnder’s blog ,.,Merry beginning of the week to ya all! Hopefully, you managed to register your studio for ,yesterday and if you’re a film or video maker we have another deadline for you!! Mark , in your calendars because ,, a gallery dedicated to film, video, sound, performance and other time-based art is now accepting film & video submissions of all types and formats for programs featuring innovative and unusual works by the Bushwick area artists in conjunction with the ,l.,Your works should be under 30 minutes and completed in 2010 or 2011. The Festival will take place June 4 & 5 at Goodbye Blue Monday.,Selected works will be announced on May 25th.,To submit send an email with your name, address, contact info, title of the work, screening format, length, date of completion, description, and a link to preview your work to BOSfilmfestival@gmail.com,If your work is not available online, send a preview DVD to: Microscope Gallery (Attention: BOS Submissions) 4 Charles Place, Brooklyn, NY 11221.,If you have any questions, email Microscope Gallery at BOSfilmfestival@gmail.com,Awesome Bushwick band Navegante (we wrote about them , some time ago) has a new video for their single All In Ur Head. Check it out!,Perhaps you have noticed the workers on Bogart and Varet in Bushwick working like busy bees… And most likely you have noticed the wooden 1920s style bar being created in front of your eyes when coming from the Morgan subway stop. And maybe you were lucky enough to catch the soft launching of The Morgan 3 weeks ago. If not do not despair! Because [the very secret] bar at 25 Bogart St. opens for real tonight with all the festivities!,Richard Guishard and Jitka Karlikova, both artists and Richard specializing in interior design, are the co-owners and are promising a lot of fun. The Morgan will be probably the biggest live music venue in Bushwick with 3 [!!!] stages. We have seen the 1st of the them during the soft opening; additionally there is a music lounge in the basement that opens tonight for the 1st time;  and in about 2 weeks the 3rd live music space opens in the back.,
,We stopped busy Richard Guishard for a quick interview about tonight’s grand opening:,So we are going to start the night around 9pm with a burlesque dance. We are having free samples of the food from our menu until 10pm. And then we have 3 bands in the basement, in the Morgan Lounge.,Yeah!,Yes! It’s huge.,Yes. Every single day. From 5pm to midnight on weekdays and  from 11am for the brunch until like 2am on the weekends.,Yes, definitely, we will have concerts… We want to target Bushwick and Williamsburg people, maybe also people from Manhattan. Depending on the type of the event and on the promoter.,I don’t have a particular music inclination, but I want this place to be a reflection of the neighborhood. I want people to contribute. I want local bands, but also performances, lectures… I want this to be a community center.,Yes, we will be having rotating exhibitions.,So come and say hi tonight from 9pm at The Morgan at 25 Bogart St. (corner Varet) on Morgan L train.,﻿,Vacuum cleaner or London Sinfonietta? Both work pretty well in the use of East London experimental musicians Micachu & The Shapes. Watch Turn Me Well from their 1st album Jewelery and Everything from Chopped & Screwed.,As time shifts towards New York and away from my childhood in Boston, I look around and realize there is not one friend whose office I can use to send a fax. I collected myself and thought again; no, no one I know works in an office.,I cast a glance backwards four years to my last days at school. Half way through my senior year, I was really starting to feel righteous and excited. “Sure,” I thought, ” I might need to pull the wool over mom’s eyes for a few months when I graduate – plant myself in some cubicle – work on the plans for world domination, it’ll be as easy as twiddling thumbs.” While around me the seniors, many of whom were also taking “E^3″ the entrepreneurship minor, were casting their nets in all directions, aiming for contacts, internships and opportunities. Almost everyone I knew was either at a stable job or looking for a 401k.,It’s hard to believe how far I have distanced myself from the world of 9 to 5′s and how far it has distanced itself from me. The closest contact I have to office environments is my brother’s second wife submitting my botched resume to the legal department at her insurance company job, assuring me with email notifications that soon I will have a remedial, stable job and mom will stop worrying. On occasion my roommate will work in the art department on a feature film assisting the art director, production designer or less excitably, pushing papers. The latter can certainly be compared to a suit oriented job, as the production company usually takes over the abandoned offices of failed companies – some of which take everything, some of which leave the eerie scent of stale boredom lingering about the cubicles.,As my roommate and I occasionally live through each other’s experiences, I can claim that I am sometimes kicking the fax machine by the front desk in the lobby, and that sometimes my roommate has to check the calendar to find out where the hell I’ve been for the last four days, and where the hell he’s supposed to be. Lives that are lived close tend to drift to an fro, touching for a year or so, before drifting back to their original treaded paths. After working with him to raise a start-up BDSM & Fetish porn production company, then taking a year to assess our personal goals, we are both starting to waver in come very creative and solid directions. While I’m working on a new website to showcase the work of a young production company [without much porn, and without much of a scary crazy Russian investor] called hausNY, he’s helping produce trailers, shorts, reels and pilots for both new and old projects that come his way.,Hue Hefner [as well as many others] have been quoted to say “at the start I wore ever so many hats”. While it might take a while to get where we are headed changing hats all day – maybe longer but hopefully much sooner than getting tenure – it will certainly be nice to make senior partner, to myself.,——-,Today’s column was written while I indulged in ::,Haagen-Dazs , flavored frozen yogurt, with raw almonds and blackberries.,[The froyo can occasionally be found in Bushwick, at Bushwick & Myrtle's Best Deli, Myrtle & Broadway's beloved Mr. Kiwi or Khims Millenium Market on Bushwick & Johnson],——-,In my vintage 60’s dress obtained in Williamsburg a couple of days ago, with the utmost care, a love for clothing, and the determination to face any fancy society, I am standing at the entrance of a SoHo loft where , is throwing a benefit for her upcoming ,. I met Sarah a couple of weeks ago at , at 3rd Ward, where she came to present her living painting project.,She was like a fairy floating between the audience, giving away her famous matches (showcasing a scene from one of her Tableau Vivant performances, involving an implausible interaction between two young, nude females and two elderly, fully dressed women). I wasn’t quite sure what this Tableau thing was about, but I was determined to find out.,I do know that Sarah is fascinated by photographic portrayals of sharp contrast – This is highlighted in her work, both among her individual subjects, and between her subjects and their surroundings.,In the mean time, inside the SoHo loft, a pink cocktail is melting my insides, leaving me oblivious to the rain and mayhem outside. I am watching a portion of a documentary about the process creating the Tableaux Vivants and I am starting to understand how much care Sarah dedicates to the casting process of her models. In the performances, part of the cast performs nude, while others are fully clothed. An inseparable part of each of the Tableau Vivant performances is also a Bulgarian a Cappella group, enhancing the emotionally dense atmosphere on the stage.,Later on, in Sarah’s living room, I am drinking a peppermint chocolate tea she has prepared, admiring her collection of My Little Ponies and her attention to adorable details. I am thinking that her apartment doesn’t seem like the apartment of a famous artist, but, at the same time, I am wondering just how the apartment of a famous artist should look… Probably something like this.,Sarah is explaining the difference between nude and naked photographs. While nude photographers expose the human body as shape and object, Sarah is looking to position her models into a place where, through their naked bodies, they expose their deepest emotional states; their souls.,Sarah is describing how the idea of her Tableaux has evolved. In the very beginning, she just wanted a live photo-shoot, only soon to realize that she was actually creating a living painting. Sarah casts characters in a variety of ages, ethnicities, and personalities, with all sorts of backgrounds: from people working in the prudent environment of finance, who feel the desire to express themselves artistically, to professional artists. Most of the people coming to Sarah are determined from the beginning, whether they choose to perform naked or in clothes. Sarah says it’s 50:50. She directs them to interact with each other, and to express the strongest emotion they can feel – Some people choose tears, others laughter, some are sensual, others angry…The performances usually last about 30 minutes, though Sarah is aiming for about an hour in her upcoming 120 model Tableau.,All 7 of the past Tableaux have included a Bulgarian singing group. I am curious how an American photographer ends up singing tragic Bulgarian folklore songs – Sarah smiles, and tells me how by accident, she discovered a record of Bulgarian singing in The Providence Public Library while at art school, and thought it was the most beautiful thing she had ever heard. She has always been very musical and after she moved to New York, she decided to join a Bulgarian a Cappella choir, herself.,Sarah describes that her goals for Tableau Vivant, are not the photographs, or the documentary film. In the very fashion of the 19th century tableaux vivants, and in the spirit of old masters, it’s the performance and the experience itself, which is the ultimate goal…,
,Matt Coch is a Bushwick-based photographer, born in the Bronx and the man behind an amazing photo-blog ,. Matt says he likes to share his passion for Brooklyn and New York through the images. Bushwick Daily totally fell for his project ,.,During his walks in the neighborhood, Matt is constantly confronted with items that have either been lost or discarded onto its sidewalks and streets. Like an archaeologist who pieces together the story of past societies through unearthed artifacts, Matt has been photographing and documenting these found objects. Taken together, these images paint a portrait of our neighborhood and its fellow residents.,On a block in Chelsea devoid of nearly all advertising, at the west side edge of the world, hangs a lonely sign “Scores”, across from which is a series of large black doors and an ever growing line of sophisticated, middle aged spectators who had all signed up for the earliest time slot on this particular Tuesday evening.,A large, yet soft-spoken bouncer – in traditional security regalia of black sports jacket, black everything – is armed with one blue starred stamp and a short, bouncy sidekick on a walkie talkie – the ear piece strapped to his head.,They let us in 5-10 at a time, “good thing it’s warm out”, I thought as I took one last look down the line before I was ushered in with a handfull of strangers chatting behind me. Only a few steps beyond the door, total darkness set in, with one dim 5watt bulb hanging low in an old dusty fixture above our heads, it seemed as though it might as well have been shining darkness rather than light; I got tingle rolled down my spine. A few minutes later the line had become an exercise for my eyes, to acclimate to the deep black of the walls and the textures of indiscernible paint and concrete, plastic and metal.,Finally, arriving at the “concierge / check-in” of the hotel [venue] I was handed a playing card [10 of spades] and was told to walk to my right and make a left up the stairs.,HERE IS WHEN IT GETS CONFUSING.,By the time you reach the holding area, a smokey red velvet lined jazz lounge [sometimes] playing live music, you forget that you had just walked up X amount of flights, delivering you from the X floor to the X one. Here you listen for when your playing card is called by a crooner of a jazz lounge host, over a vintage microphone, you are ushered to the elevator by the lady of the dance floor. Then, you are handed a mask, ordered not to talk and crammed into an elevator where you will most certainly be separated from your friends. The elevator makes a random stop on either the X, X, X, or X floor, of which you have no say and no knowledge [if the liftman sees you looking at the number display he will shut it off, as I found out]. By the time you are ejected from this elevator, you realize that when everyone is wearing masks and are not allowed to speak [thus becoming anonymous] they become extremely rude, pushy and retain few physical limits when cutting you off. Granted, by now the later time slot / younger ticket holders had filtered in and mixed up the age demographic. We stampeded out of the elevator, I paused, body acclimating to the change in atmosphere.,By the damp chill in the air I could tell I was on the X floor, I walked around some bedroom chambers, a living room full of shelves, clocks and letters from Lady MacBeth. “A clue!” I thought, despite already knowing the premise. I walked in and out of tiny rooms, observing the meticulous decoration as much as I observed the other guests. When I had first imagined the scenes being interactive, my main concern had been people being too polite to ruffle through the drawers and notes. But the rapid news of such a liberally interactive installation must have spread fast, because everyone in eyesight was poking, prodding and sifting through relics like monkeys on a field trip. I circled my way through the layers of draped fabric and electric candles into a ballroom overwhelmed with the scent of pine. In the middle was a dance scene with three couples ballroom dancing in the broad sense of the term. In my corner of the floor, governess put a cloak on a young girl, then the couple hurriedly took off. I follow them; I loose track of the girl but follow the matron back up to the mezzanine of clocks, where she covers them, slowly, with cloths. I wander off to the balcony overlooking the ballroom scene I was standing on only moments ago, now on the dance floor a couple is fighting. A bald witchy woman is hissing at a man, they throw each other across the floor gracefully, landing like cats, or birds, or professional dancers. The man runs off to the side, up the stairs, across the floor – suddenly a crowd of 50 guests is hurdling themselves up the stairs trying to stay on someone’s heels. All heels are lost; I pick a doorway – and find myself on the X floor.,I see a new crowd in a corner in the room, heads bowed to peer down at something. Lady Macbeth is waiting impatiently, body contorting in spastic yet controlled, rhythmically precise movements, building with the crescendo of the song driving her madness. She balances on the edge of a bathtub before loosing her grip – her husband runs in, with blood covered hands, her back too is now stained red. She strips him nude while they embrace in a sequence of frantic kisses, intermittently pausing for his entry into the tub, his last strands of public discomfort shine in his eyes and stain his breath like pigments of hesitation. Rapidly, he rubs off the blood, then hesitantly with a staccato in his step he emerges from the tub to join his Lady; they walk back to the corner and lie down in bed. Then suddenly he sits up, jumps out of bed and leaves the room again; half the spectators follow, some stay – here the Lady rubs her hands repeating “out, out damn spot” as she throws herself violently against the walls and bed, repeatedly. I grow bored and wonder what other performances are going on as I stand glued to my spot, so I exit through the glass doors surrounding the bedroom chambers, and walk through a garden with half walls of brick and large statues of mary bathed in blue light, as I search for performances and a couple particular rooms I remember from the walk through, half of which I never do find. As I continue across the floor turns softer, and the scent of warm moist soil surrounds me. In the distance I see small mounds with white upward crosses stuck into the crests. At the end of the narrow path in the soil is an old abandoned stroller, one I would kill to have. I find my way to another staircase and climb upward.,On the X floor a scent of mulch fills my nostrils [maybe a little too much, as my tissues were coated in black upon exhausting the contents of my nose that night], enormous walls of crates and boxes unwind into a room with a pool table and a wall of 300 playing cards, many of queens, all tacked in one corner. Later, this would be the scene between two men and the bald witch, who will dance and laugh with a card between their lip-lock. The boy witch walks over, standing much too close, he urges me to move silently, seconds before the other man hurdles past and onto the wood bar with a loud thud. Two minutes later the girl on my left has her mask knocked by a stray foot in the tumultuous fray on the pool table. Another girl nearly trips over her own feet, which would have landed her face first on a wood box, trying to outrun the crowd to secure a front seat at the other end of the room to which the action has moved. The crowd is too much for me, and so I escape into rooms that are filled with black magic and dry purple flowers above my head, and others filled with musk like grandma’s. I look for an air freshener, a plug-in of sorts for at least 3minutes before I admit that if I were to find one, it would certainly not be labeled “grandma,” and that all objects, garments and fabrics in the room must contain centuries of history to smell so pungently of the past.,I wander back towards the room full of taxidermy birds, animal heads and bones as if it’s my one familiar sight in this strange massive world. The path there is a hallway of what seem to be a number of rooms and shops through wich actors move, there stands a girl with a box and a key, which a guest tries to touch and nearly gets her hand slapped. Another girl gets chosen and rushed off, pulled by her arm into a little room, to experience a solo show, a creepy lap dance of sorts with incantations and rituals I was not privy to this time around. I walk around the corner, a taxidermist’s workshop, nearby is a candy store; each room decorated and etched inch by inch to the last detail. A funeral parlor with a coffin, books, quill, ink wells and death certificates, stamped with the year 1934. And with that clue, things started to make sense. But, I have said too much already, I will leave not only the remaining X and X floors a mystery, but also the conclusion with it’s occasionally malfunctioning noose.,Folks, this is a must see. I don’t want to ruin ALL the fun and surprises so you will just have to trust me. I know here in Bushwick tickets upwards of $75 sound like less than a steal – but think of it as taking yourself on a date [yes, it's that good]. Save your pennies, and tip cheap, cut corners, don’t cut your hair – do ANYTHING and everything to get your asses to ,. A-SAP.","

"Black coffee in a plastic cup that Andrew Birk served me in his studio at Johnson Avenue reached the perfect temperature to start being sipped and I just reached a peace agreement with my perfectionist self that this week’s Tuesday Person, Andrew Birk, will be photographed with an iPhone, instead of my regular bulky Canon 5D.,Andrew, a Bushwick painter, just lit up his cigarette and took a sip of his coffee as well. Noticeably hype on caffeine, he is jumping around, trying to show me everything at once: from a number of paintings to the music he likes and to his hand-made maisonette. Luckily, my coffee is starting to kick in nicely and I am able to follow Andrew’s speed.,Andrew, still holding his plastic cup, is just running up the stairs while explaining that virtually all of his paycheck from an art supply store goes to pay the rent for this studio. He doesn’t buy much food and runs on coffee instead. Andrew likes this deal.,We were both sitting on the chairs on the wooden maisonette, and Andrew is playing with the volume button of his stereo. “My friends and I make ,. This is my voice, I am talking about wanting to have sex with girls.” Andrew comments on the music that is playing in his studio. “Are you offended?” he asks and I have to laugh because I am actually impressed.,Andrew is excited that I am taking photos with an iPhone. He says that he hates those ‘beautiful’ overly fabricated photos in the magazines.  He loves noise and red eyes and is the biggest fan of amateur Facebook photos where everyone looks a bit dorky. “Yeah, it’s perfect. It actually works way better with what I am trying to make here. Like those paintings.” He points to a number of paintings lying on the floor. “I am trying to make as many as possible. Without thinking about what I’m doing. ” He says he’s trying to awaken the primitive inside of him, that monkey who, despite all the techniques he learned at art school, paints instinctively. Andrew is aware of the temporariness of these paintings and wants to make so many that they would cover the entire floor and people coming to his studio will have no other choice but to walk on them and destroy them.,I’m assigning my brain homework: Take ugly pictures! Forget crispiness, vibrant colors or aperture. This is iPhone 2 in action. Bring on the noise!,Andrew is telling me about this kid from California he likes, ,, and is asking me if I know him. I don’t and so he goes on: This kid makes a lot of music and uploads it to the Internet almost every day. Some of his stuff is pretty bad, but some things are great and Andrew generally likes this creative approach. Becoming a monkey, that’s a life-long mission.,
,
, , is a Bushwick-based production collective who came to the public attention thanks to the number of music events they have hosted in their Bushwick loft, Swan Loft, since 2008. Paper Swan has showcased a number of the most celebrated Brooklyn ,s.,Now, Paper Swan have scored a collaboration with one of the most popular Brooklyn’s venues, ,, sponsored by , to host a series of 9 monthly fundraising music events, the first one to support ,. The first of the events will take place tomorrow at 8pm in Union Hall and will feature music by The Click Clack Boom, Feral Foster, Thy Burden, Rickety Wrists, and Free Advice. The admission is only $5.,Paper Swan is promising a lot of fun in the upcoming weeks in their Swan Loft in Bushwick, so stay tuned to your favorite Bushwick blog ,Bushwick Daily is happy to introduce an iPhone photographer Prince Franco and a selection of 4 photographs from his ongoing series ,. Multiple layers of his Reflection photos unravel objects and feelings captured consciously and subconsciously as well. Prince takes these mainly on his train rides using his iPhone, which gives him a discrete profile as opposed to a DSLR camera. Prince says that he can’t afford a DSLR camera, nor he wants one and is fully determined to explore the limits of an iPhone.,Prince Franco was born in the largest housing projects in North America, in Queensbridge, Long Island City and at the age of 18 was arrested for an assault with a deadly weapon. That’s when he realized he doesn’t want to become just another minority guy in the NYC jail system and wants to create art. He studied fashion design and realized the power of capturing an image when his best friend introduced him to the famous polaroids taken by one of the most influential personalities of the time, ,.,My look into the world of interactive theater, and large scale installation art had exactly who starting points.,The first point was planted, like a stake of a tent, securely into the damp ground of my life a year and a half ago during the month of October. I had never worked on a “run” of any show, let alone a month long run of up to four shows a day, but many cast members had. My good friend , had asked me to participate as a character in an interactive, theatrical haunted house. The concept was fairly simple – , Ok, it was more simple than it sounds, at least after all the wrinkles were smoothed out by inevitable mishaps, poor planning or namely the sponsor’s lawyer who would walk around sending emails from his blackberry to the director with notes on censorship. The brunt of the creative blow weighed on the director and the cast, some of whom were let go and some of whom remained to piece together a very vanilla s&m halloween show. The one stable force was ,, the producer of many large events in both nightlife and theater, as well as Purgatorio. Despite being paid a day rate more suitable for a PA, it was hard to be late, knowing you would get a polite inquiry and stern look from the man who was becoming the show’s emotionally unavailable mother X your mildly flirtatious middle school teacher, who was entirely responsible for your check at the end of each week.,The opposite stake of my rather figurative tent was planted this past December of 2010. I had been walking around the Scope show warehouse of regurgitated art when one booth struck me. The wall noted the exhibit [or sculpture] to be titeled A Viking Funeral, by Ryan O’Conner. There was a pile of coal with two beautiful iron gates propped up in it with a metal rod projecting vertically in the middle, supporting a generously reflective chunk of broken glass. I stopped. My two escorts who at the time were wearing body suits of silver material more glaring than the glass shard, were also stopped at the edge of the booth, looking up a ladder at a man teetering at the top, tinkering with a track light. “How’s this?” he asked. Here I stepped forward, no longer being able to hold back my objection [an occurrence more frequent than the inverse], I voiced the opinion that the chair of hammers was much too aggressive to have any business hiding in the back. An hour or two [I obviously lost count after the placement of the 5 foot hourglass shaped structure] I was sipping on Johnnie Black, discussing my choices with Ryan, who was starting to reveal some local Bushwick affiliations and friends. By the end of our chat I had determined him to be a local artist forever on the run from mediocrity as well as a small town / community mindset, despite being inseparable from some ancient staples of Bushwick party culture, mainly the Danger crew [and now Artists Wanted].,I have had a lot of worlds and stories collide, no doubt to my surprise as much as  my readers’, but this was one was – as they say- for the books. I was told by Ryan, soon after our return from Basel | Miami | 2010 that I had to see the interior of this old club that had been remodeled into 6 floors of stages, with installations on every floor but the top most, and 22 actors playing out the story of Macbeth. As Vance stepped around the massive columns of the building to welcome our small group of wayward artists and visionaries, I let out a shriek of joy – , he was producing this show. As he wound us through the tour, spouting facts and figures without much thought, it became apparent how many tours he must be giving privately in order to keep this show away from main stream advertising and press. The rooms were filled with endless stacks paper, whole and shredded, taxidermy, claw foot bathtubs filled with dirt, dirt filled rooms with forests and forests of hanging dolls around cribs and eggs in cribs of filing cabinets filled with shredded paper files. IT WAS INSANE, which I am fairly certain was the production goal. With an estimated budget of $8 million, and $75-$85 / , I would hope t0 loose an ounce of sanity, for at least the two hours of my life during which I am lost in a play.,Yours Truly be attending , in the next couple of weeks – keep your eyes loosely open for reviews.,The sound of the breaks against the rubber tires of my bike feels so good. Alas! It’s the first beautiful day in Bushwick in about million years. I just stopped in front of ,‘  house at Wilson Avenue. Allison is sitting on the stairs holding the leash of her long-haired dog Lucy. She’s pleasurably inhaling the fresh spring air and Lucy is wishfully gazing in the direction of Maria Hernandez Park.,
Allison shakes my hand and smiles. Lucy licks the handle of my bike and sniffs my knee. I understand that the three of us are buddies from now on.,I’m curiously checking out the vintage cameras neatly placed on the shelves in Allison’s living room. She’s explaining from the kitchen, while preparing aromatic Russian tea that she loves to collect them, although as it turns out many times, most of them don’t work.,
In the corner under the living room table sits Lucy pretending that she’s a little dog. On the table lies a stack of freshly made , prints ready to be hung in , before Allison’s first solo show opens on Saturday.,Allison is a passionate traveler. She saw remote villages, hiked to active volcanoes, tall mountains and seas of different shades of blue. She has traveled to Middle East, Southeast Asia and Central America, many times only by herself.,She smiles shyly, explaining she doesn’t like to be on the other side of the camera too much. Her blue eyes sparkle when she’s telling me about her upcoming travel plans to Iceland and India. She carefully uncovers her photographs with white gloves. She took those when traveled equipped only by analogue cameras. Allison says she prefers the discrete profile of her film cameras, in addition to the aesthetic and processes they lend. Actually, she always prefers the film cameras whether she’s somewhere far and remote, or as near as South Jersey.,Many weeks later after Allison develops the photos in her kitchen, she likes to look at them again. Then she discovers that some of them are more than just her travel memories.,You can tell the excitement in the air… The 1st Bushwick ballet , presented by Jason Andrew and Norte Maar premiers this Thursday and will continue until Saturday. I became a part of the family of the choreographer Julia Gleich for 2 rehearsals and followed the development of this exciting piece with my camera. Take a peak behind the scenes and get ,, because the ballet is almost sold out!, ,, ballet presented by Jason Andrew and Norte Maar, April 14, 15, 16 at 7:30pm, , in Brooklyn, Directed and choreographed by Julia K.

, and , painting on the wall of an art supply store in Bushwick today.,Over the past few months I have written some fairly subjective stories about this show or that movie, even a story about a creep-tastic stalker accompanied by an amazing video. I was going to write this one a few weeks ago but first I had to write the , to , helpful little bit.,Flashback – after hearing the said creep boast for weeks about his multiple benefits cards [supposedly he had both his and his ex-girlfriends aka last identity theft victim] I realized that I, a white girl recently from the suburbs of Boston, with a college education was not only unemployed [according to the IRS] but also an exemplary candidate for the , in New York. Thanks to my cash only income and cash only rent payment, very little money flowed through my bank; I had virtually no profit. However, as benefits are determined per household [I guess they assume you and your roommates pool money for food?] I claimed virtually nothing over rent, stating that my roommate [you have to bring a lease, 2 forms of photo ID, pay-subs / letter from ""employer"" and a 12pg application] paid all of rent, and that I got paid $10/hr for 4hrs per week distributing flyers for a party. For this, I made up a receipt from my supposed boss [me], using a co-promoters name and signature below my promotional business card which I had stapled to the top of a receipt. I was so nervous about this forgery that I had actually forgotten to include my own name on the “pay stub”. For this, I had to return to the offices [in a building only slightly less confusing than the labyrinth of where you go to have parking violation hearings] a few days after my initial application, wait an hour to submit it as proof, and another 2hrs for a receipt stating that I had submitted proof of employment [which of course got lost, causing them to call me in for the first of a number of pointless hearings].,The catch is, when you say you don’t work, you have no excuse to rescheduling a hearing. Within a brief month or two of receiving my card [which I had to pick up in the city, rather than the one in brooklyn I had been walking to], my balance was no longer being replenished on the 6th of every month. I soon received a letter in the mail, stating that I had not submitted the required proof and employment [which I had the long awaited receipt for - useless] and was going to be called in for a hearing shortly. A week or two after the first letter, I received the second letter stating that I had a hearing in downtown brooklyn, at a 3rd location [a labyrinth worse than the first].,I had done a good job dressing in anonymous ready-to-wear and no make-up for the afternoon trips to the claims office, but the morning hearing was a different story. Luckily I remembered to not put on make up or heels, but did mistakenly wear a particularly prominent set of knee high puma boots. Hiding them uncomfortably under the pine table of the inquisition booth, the judge took one look at my paperwork, and after a few preliminary questions to verify my identity, she promptly dismissed the case. My obligatory $4.50 metro card was issued to me at the end of another line and I was on my way home. I was giddy to know the three months of back pay were going to come through just in time for thanksgiving [which would have meant I was starving for months now, had I actually only $40/week to live on]. I spent it all in one foul swoop of mash and pies, as well as some bottles of wine my local organics food mart allowed me to buy with food stamps [totally illegal].,I received my next letter 6months in to my  benefits program, only 2 months after the first hearing; it was a form to send back, confirming the unfortunate state of my unemployment, and to let me know in these cold months about , [which I promptly applied to and received benefits of something like $450 over the course of the winter - a droplet in the pool of $4k we paid for occasional winter warmth].,In the spring, I received another summons, this time they didn’t believe that I was residing in Brooklyn due to my Massachusetts mailing address and license. Rather, I received a temporary cease of benefits notice, which was then followed by a summons to the tall downtown Brooklyn maze of a building. There I was scolded gently by my case defendant / spanish translator for not having a NY license, after which the case was once again promptly dismissed. It was clear to me on this day that I had to make a decision: MA health insurance – or – NY food stamps.,A couple months later, in the summer, a year since I had printed out the outdated, 2008 revision of an , from the state website [which I filled out, brought to the office, only to find out it was last years form and that I had to fill it out again], I received the annual resubmission letter, which I ceremoniously placed in the left side pocket of my benefits folder [which had grown to the size of the folded Sunday Times], and closed it like another chapter in my curious life.,You gotta love this one ","

"It is any Friday night in Bushwick. The setting is simple. There are paintings hanging on the walls and about 3 times as many people as you could possibly imagine fitting into this gallery. The beer is still warm, and the gin tonic in my hand has been clearly been prepared by someone who strongly discriminated against tonic in the said mixture.,“So… you’re a sculptor?” I’m standing underneath an abstract piece with a girl named ,.,“Yes.” she smiles.,“But… you’re really into… music?”,“Not that much into music. I’m more like into … sound.” says Audra with a smile of a person who has a really nice secret that she might be willing to share if I prove to be patient enough to listen.,Audra is the author of an experimental sound piece in the upcoming and very first Bushwick ballet presented by ,, called ,. The ballet premiers on April 14 and I am determined to find out what does sculpture and sound have in common before that.,I’m two steps behind Audra who is a Bushwick resident, but her studio is in the very industrial part of Williamsburg, about 2 blocks away from the water. The sun has just begun to set and the pipes, tubes, and huge containers filled with undefined liquid are throwing long shadows. The workers have already left for their homes. It is strangely quiet and the industrial beauty mesmerizes me.,“It’s a little sketchy here.” Audra laughs.,Audra’s studio is filled with books about sound, phonetics, speech, and with maps of sounds. She talks about the sculpture on the floor, which looks like many houses stuck together in a very claustrophobic manner. It is part of the series of sound formation in concrete, she says. Normally, these wedges are made of foam and are used in anechoic chambers.,Still curious about the sound piece for the ballet, I ask Audra to play me the piece she has created for A/V Elevator Project at Art in General, which inspired , of Norte Maar to invite her to participate at the creation of the ballet. Audra says she has created a series of layered sounds that explore communication through fragmentation. She recorded sounds of her own voice and edited out the main parts of each word to leave a series of stops and starts; a slippery language of faintly recognizable utterances. Audra explains that this way, attention is drawn to the cadence of voice without language. She calls it ,.,Audra was inspired by the work of Julles Valles, ,

							,“Bushwick is still Puerto Rican!” claims Willie Jr. passionately in the preview of the new web series East Willy B, which will premier on April 13 online ,.,The creators of the upcoming show say that they’ve created an American story told through Latin eyes. It is a story about gentrification of a neighborhood and how it impacts its locals. Willie Jr. runs a popular Puerto Rican bar at Broadway, near the Kosciusko stop, which is now facing a threat that it will have to close down. However, Willie Jr. is not ready to give up just yet and has a plan. Only time will tell how will he and the new Bushwick series do. Watch a trailer and stay tuned for the premiere of the show on April 13.,﻿,You know how it goes…. It’s a Friday afternoon and the entire Bushwick buzzes because of all the great events that are going on in our beloved hood. It can get really difficult, I know… Because there is only one Friday April 1, 2011 night; only one good-fun-seeking yourself and there is only [this] many events you can attend in a night.,But let me tell you one thing… The best fun will be in , tonight, because the , is celebrating their 3rd year. This cool Brooklyn writing, art and music collective makes zines, hosts readings, and throws art and music shows. The collective’s founder Tommy Pico promises only the best fun tonight. A bunch of bands will play and several Birdsong-related artists will be selling  limited editions of their prints.

,The last time I tried to attend the NYC Opera, it was one of those summer runs where the admission is free.,It was one of those days that’s too hot at first but becomes uncomfortably chill as the sun sets behind the surprisingly tall buildings around 66th and broadway. We anticipated the crowds and thus arrived an hour early only to find not a single seat without a placeholder sweater or bag, beside a row of family members scowling at one another or an elderly couple scowling at you. To my surprise, the free opera my friend had been raving about for weeks was just a large projection of a prerecorded show, cast on a large white screen outside the main entrance of the opera house, for over 300 senior citizens of new york to gawk at in reminiscent of when their social security could accommodate a budget of live entertainment, and if this is indeed what the 21st century entailed.,We took a vote; it was in the favor of taking our picnic to central park, rather than the stairs of the opera house courtyard which too by the hour encroaching the screening was becoming unbearably crowded with early latecomers. The group of us sat in the park, each having a private monologue about the successes and failures of the trip; concealing my discomfort on the cold rocks and disappointment with my misconceptions of what a free opera would entail with occasional laughter, I silently wondered what my first opera in NYC would be.,A little over half a year later, a very gracious friend who I greatly appreciate the company of extended an invitation to the opening night of “Monodramas” [which runs March 25th - April 8th] via the hospitality of John Zorn and friends.,I pick up the program and read the three synopses for the pieces I am about to absorb. I have just enough time to finish them before the lights begin to dim; I close the program, reminding myself to look over the notes and artists later.,The first piece was by our friend ,, which up until reading the program, I had assumed composed all the music for the evening. This first opera was roughly 20min long and called “La Machine de L’etre” [""The Machine of Being""] and focused on the direction of chaos via musical composition and projected drawings by , in his less gracefully years from the end of his celebrated and schizophrenic life as a beautiful person. The most exciting parts where:,1. the drawings [projected into two word bubbles suspended above the actors, one of which combusted into flames as a finale - which I thought was a copout] by Artaud, because I have a childhood fascination with schizophrenia,2. The man in a red zoot suit who was suspended towards the finale [because if was the only color in the costumes and because it woke me up a little],3. The fact that Zorn did not write any text for the piece, nor gave stage direction. He left all the visual aspects up to the interpretation of the stage director. What a guy. LET THIS BE A LESSON TO YOU.,The second piece was an old one by , with text/libretto written in an actual language [German] by 26 year old psychology student , in the early 1900′s translated on a wide screen at the top of the stage. It was called “Erwartung” [program translation: ""Waiting"" // wiki translation: ""Expectation""] and was the most coherent plot line of the three. It went on for about 30min displaying objective and subjective, loving and suspicious thoughts of a woman who, in a dream, is to meet her lover in the woods but discovers him dead. The drama builds, as the rose petals perpetually fall from the rafters, accumulating on the floor. The conclusion shows how she suspects herself to be the killer, or rather perpetrator of the relationship as she first approaches him still alive in the forest; an abstract flash forward within a lover’s mind.,The third piece “Neither” seemed longest, but was no longer than the second. It was intermediate in age compared to the other two pieces, being composed in 1976-77 by , to a libretto by ,. It was the most abstract but summed up concretely the subject of simultaneous objectivity and subjectivity within one persons internal dialog. The music was a repetitive nine note loop, with mildly coherent pronunciation [mostly the last line ""unspeakable home"" which resonated for hours after leaving the venue]. The tones changed whereas the notes stayed the same, to the effect of someone singing to you for 30minutes on a rather fast carousel ride. The lulling composition and brilliant soprano put me in a trance for some portions of the piece, but not enough to overlook the tacky reflective stage backgrounds [no doubt in an attempt to elongate the stage] or the musical theater kids they hired to play patty cake with themselves several times towards the height of the internal turmoil. However, the three tiers of suspended silver cubes lifting and falling made up for it all.,If you like tension, this is one’s for you.,I have always felt this mixture of sorrow and fascination with the birds captured in large halls after they accidentally flew in. There is one in Staten Island Ferry Hall flying in circles above my head in confusion as I’m sipping weak coffee and walking in circles myself, because I’m unable to sit still. Soon I’ll be on the ferry to Staten Island. The statue with the dictionary will be photographed a thousand times by the tourists on the ferry, and the skyscrapers in Manhattan will look like plastic toys. This is an almost daily commute for street artist , who bikes from South Ferry where he needs to, and frequently to Bushwick, which he has (temporarily) abandoned to seek refuge in the (relative) silence of Staten Island.,I met Veng on Supermoon night at ,. , loves his signature square faces and asked him to spray one of the entrances to their active space at ,.,The sun is lying badly today and the wind is cold and rough as I debark at Staten Island. Veng is picking me up by the baseball fields in a red truck and will let me snap some photos in his studio. Veng is a friendly smile of a person who usually prefers thinking over talking. He is showing me paintings of his buddies from the ,, which are piled up in the living room, waiting to be hung in a gallery. Despite the cold weather, he’s wearing only shorts with tiny spots of paint on them. I can tell he’s a bit tired. He was painting until 5am to finish his works for the show, which opens ,. Robots Will Kill is celebrating its 10th anniversary with a show at Vincent Michael Gallery in Philly.,His three paintings are leaning against the wall in his bright studio. Veng is almost done; there are only a couple of details to finish. He offers to pretend to paint for me while I am taking photos, but once he sits down in front of his unfinished painting and takes a brush to his hand, he starts to paint for real. He’s telling me how to mix walnut oil and yellow toxic powder in order to get the precise shade of yellow you want, and I’m flipping through books about street art that feature his work. We’re talking about the square heads on the walls in Bushwick, and I’m trying to figure them out. They seem genderless and wise in their melancholy. As if they knew something we’re all trying to figure out, but at the same time as if the knowledge wasn’t all that pleasant., ,Get inspired by the looks of Bushwick residents! We love their style!,Bushwick-based non-profit organization ,, which is fully dedicated to the promotion of emerging curators and artists, is having a ¡SPRING SPRING! benefit this Saturday at 8pm at the House of Yes (342 Maujer St., Brooklyn). Bushwick sweethearts , will play, alongside with our favorite DJs LIL LIL (of New Humans at the Cove) and James Mulry (of Particularly Random at Tandem). If that’s not enough, there will be a ballet performance by Gleich Dances Contemporary in collaboration with Andrew Hurst, and an aerial performance by the House of Yes.,
,We chatted with Deborah Brown, an artist and a board member of NURTUREart who explained NURTUREart’s mission.  The organization maintains a gallery at 910 Grand Street with a full exhibition program of emerging artists organized by young curators. In curating their exhibitions, curators make use of a registry of artists’ images maintained by NURTUREart.  NURTUREArt also sponsors a monthly Muse Fuse salon where the public has an opportunity to converse with leaders in the arts in an informal setting.,Additionally, NURTUREart directs individual artists to work with students in selected public schools in Brooklyn to develop their artistic, curatorial, and life skills and to supplement programs often cut from school curriculae for budgetary reasons. NURTUREart has been working with the Juan Morel Campos Secondary School (SS71) in Williamsburg since 2004, and in 2008 started its partnership with Charles O. Dewey Middle School (MS136) in Sunset Park. In 2011, the program was expanded to include the Grand Street Campus High School in East Williamsburg. ,The funds raised through the ¡SPRING SPRING! benefit will be used exclusively to cover the expenses of NURTUREart projects.,Come have fun in finest Bushwick fashion while feeling good about supporting a good cause!,

I was surprised. Questions like, “What demographic of press do they cater to? What other films do they represent?” arose as I compiled my slight pile of research findings. As the weeks after my group interview progressed, I began receiving emails from the same publicist inviting me to attend other screenings; apparently publicists function a lot like nightlife promoters – you’re having dinner with them one evening, you’re on a million and one mailing lists [they've sold your name to], the next. I took it with a grain of salt, and read the synopsis for the film in question.,, was being screened more than a handful of times, I chose one – midday and midweek – to avoid the younger writers I had to sit with during that aforementioned round table talk with Quentin Dupieux, some of whom could not name exactly which publication they were writing for that day, when interrogated in the elevator.,“This will be chill,” I thought as I emailed an invitation for Mr. Haley to join me, “like a research date.” Little did I know I would need a bodyguard.,We get to the Sony building on Madison and 55th; we wind our way through a series of doors and hallways, elevators to floors where they check IDs and names, followed by more elevators to other floors where they take those tickets and tell you to sit, and wait. I look around from my vaguely appointed seat; 10 scattered, middle aged, weathered individuals, with a staidly pall cast over their demeanor sit stooped and silent in their seats.,I excused myself to the ladies room; upon my return, with some speed, a healthy gait, and flourish to my long military trench, I curved around a section of chairs where a lady of indiscernible age was wedged into her large leather seat. I came to a seat directly across from her, longwise across the coffee table, circumvented by 8 square, black leather chairs. I perched on the armrest, staring down at the printed synopsis and listing of cast and awards, alternately glancing at the cactus air plants in the square glass vases – wondering about my failure to keep my own alive and how much the interior designer was paid to come up with such a depressingly modern theme of grays.,“EXCUSE ME. I’m sorry. Can I just ask you a question.”,A woman’s loud voice pierced the air, interrupting my thoughts, offending my ears, and generally starting me from a very meditative state. Her appearance was no less shocking. Beneath her large flat brim, hunter green, forest hat, complete with shoelace chin strap, was a short, plump lady with several large bags next to her seat [and may has well had just as many mangy cats heaped on her knees]. She shoved her body weight forward in the seat with effort, straining her short arms to keep her leaning forward without tipping out. [Mr. Haley later remarked, ""she looked like the white homeless women from the myrtle + ryerson intersection circa 2000, with a slightly more trim mustache.""],“I JUST want to ask – is it painful to walk in those shoes?” Oh my, could this be a compliment escaping from those weathered lips?,“No, they’re actually quite comfortable despite their appearance. They’re platforms – so they’re not so bad.” I lift my foot up an inch to the side to show her what I mean.,Like a dog given the biggest biscuit it’s ever seen, she jumps up in her seat, growing another inch – she exclaims:,“HA! NOT SO BAD. So they DO hurt. YOU’RE A SLAVE TO FASHION!!”,The possible come backs fly through my head, too fast for my tongue to grip onto a single sentiment:,“I’d rather be a slave to fashion than a slave to mediocrity.”,“How does it feel to push everyone way?”,“Do you enjoy being lonely?”,I stare for half a second before shaking my head to loosen my grip on her proverbial neck. I immediately go back to my conversation as if not a beat had been skipped, just like drunk dancing a tango.,An announcement is made, I hear her gather her pile of bags [and imaginary cats] to enter the theater, we wait a while then follow; the lights dim and opening credits roll. Still shaken by our encounter with crazy pre-war feminist lady Mr. Haley and I take our our phones to silence them - there are no ushers here, no previews to warn us about the dangers of distractions.,Another voice pierces the silence, a different tone comes from close behind. “Can you PLEASE turn your phone off, I find it VERY DISTRACTING”. She sits back down before I could snap right back. More head shakes and private threats ensue.,Despite the film preaching passive agression, I was charged with anger by the end of the two hours, hoping for a second run in. Better luck next time – maybe one day I’ll decide to be a diva and make a scene; for now, I write.,_____,I wanted to share the look with my readers [but as some of you know, I have problems keeping clothes on so here is a photo, sans Ms. Marquise]. I call it: “What a slave to fashion wears to a screening”.,Tory Burch sample dress [altered] SS10,Black cashmere knit tights,White Heels by Charlotte Ronson,Burberry wool trench coat FW07,Ari has been rummaging through the insides of his old-fashioned blue Garelli moped for quite a while now, only to pull out something which, if his moped was a human would probably be a gut. ,. “Here’s the carburetor,” Ari says, smiling. I’m making my very fake ,face at him, and nod. I’m wandering around, checking out a number of mopeds in the store and then in the workshop in the back. Both Ari and his buddy Pete are super-concentrated on the mopeds’ insides, so they barely pay attention to me or my curious camera. I like some of the mopeds a lot, particuarly their vintage looks and funky colors. Most have a sticker on their front light. “That’s a cute deer,” I giggle, and Ari explains in a serious voice, that’s no deer, but a Jackalope. And it is a pretty serious matter, because the Jackalope is their moped-gang sign.,Ari Sneider and his partner, Pete D’Addeo, opened a moped store called , barely two weeks ago at 1022 Broadway in Bushwick.,After Ari is finished pulling out what appear the random insides of his blue moped, he announces he’s ready for a ride. He parks his moped in front of the store and then pulls out a gray brand-new Tomos. For me, he says. My facial muscles fail miserably to create my well , face. And with mild hesitation, I announce I’ve never ridden a moped before. “It’s easy,” Ari says, and he starts showing me how to start the engine and how to brake; he commands me to make a small loop in front of the store. The little gray devil accelerates surprisingly quickly, but soon the moped and I find common grounds for discussion, and , I feel like a little kid at an amusement park.,I spent the next hour following Ari’s shirt, reading his signals–should I go right, left, slower or faster. We’re all over Bushwick and Bed-Stuy and finally I understand what is meant by the saying, “One try is worth 1,000 hours of watching.”  It’s incredible fun and freedom! The streets look completely different from a moped perspective, and I feel like I’m on a vacation somewhere in the Mediterranean.,Ari got into mopeds in high school, but getting a new one was never an option, so he built his moped from parts and just never stopped working on it. Ari says riding in a bigger group is the best, and his , makes long, enjoyable rides frequently. I’m starting to understand where the joy of a ride comes from, and with a large grin, I wave my gray devil goodbye.,For now.,“I’m going to a farm,” I announced on a sweet afternoon in my humble Bushwick dwelling. I have to say that my roommate, as well as myself were surprised by the sound of these words, because let’s face it, you can say many things about Bushwick (like that it’s lovable, enjoyable, inspiring), but certainly it’s not the greenest place on Earth. If I try really hard I can name 5 locations with trees in my close neighborhood (maybe)…  And now I know a place right here on 897 Broadway between Arion and Belvedere with a greenhouse, compost, heard of chicken, 1 duck and a bunch of shy kittens. Yes, it’s ,.,I am meeting Masha and her boyfriend Vinnie who have gotten things moving. With the help of community they have turned a vacant lot between two houses into a city farm. They cleaned the lot, built shelters for animals and for virtually 800 single dollar bills they had collected from donations, they bought a stack of fresh soil.  Masha says that the soil in the entire Tri-Sate Area is toxic, so they elevated a part of the lot, covered it with fresh soil, built a greenhouse and planted vegetables there.,The chickens are slowly loosing their fear of me and they are curiously checking out my camera. I’m paying my respect to the huge rooster who is proudly bossing around. Masha explains that most of the chickens are rescues from Pollo Viviero, a nearby slaughterhouse where they keep them in terrible conditions. People sometimes bring them new chickens, or they just find them on the street in front of the farm. New additions to the poultry team first have to spend couple of day in an isolated shelter for quarantine.,Masha and Vinnie also collect books and clothes. They made friends among organic grocery stores and bakeries who give them food for free. On the need basis they give it away with all the vegetables, fruit and eggs from the farm to the local people. They teach English and organize workshops where they teach urban people about farming. They have seen school kids discovering on the farm that chickens and eggs have something in common… Masha smiles that they bring generations together. Grandparents explain to the kids how they used to have chicken in the old country.,The volunteers are always welcomed at the farm and you can help, donate and enjoy at the same time this weekend already. From Friday through Sunday at 1-7pm you can come to hang out at the farm, observe social relations in the heard of poultry, play with kittens, drink hot cocoa, taste organic food and enjoy books with Masha and Vinnie.,

"We love the way Bushwick folks are fashionable. Every Friday we are bring you a bite of Bushwick street fashion. Stay tuned, stay inspired!,
,We haven’t heard from , since ,, but that doesn’t mean that great literary and arts fun has disappeared from Bushwick. Fireside Follies returns this Saturday, March 19, at 7 pm, to their regular home base, ,, presenting cartoonist collective ,.,
Bushwick Daily was curious what inspired Fireside Follies to switch from curating a reading series to throwing a comics and music party. We chatted with Mike Lala, a poet and a co-curator of the event.,
Mike explained that Julia Wertz (,) was one of the readers at January’s Fireside Follies and her comics full of edgy humor and self-irony, received such a huge response, that they decided to team up with a collective, Pizza Island, and organize an event around comics. The all-female cartoonist collective is based in Greenpoint, and the girls will be reading and projecting their comics.,
The event will also feature music from the production of David Heatley and Jeffrey Lewis.,
In the good Fireside Follies spirit, admission is free, but donations are welcomed.,
When talking with Mike, he leaked some  information that Pizza Island is not an abandoned island in the sea of Bushwick…  Soon we will have a brand new series to look forward to, called ,. Fireside Follies plans to bring together writers, ,, , and musicians, not to fit a theme for the night, but because they work so well together.,I seldom relive the few days of my life when I was in ultimate fear, which for an equally short while kept me ultimately amused. It started in a bodega, late night, on the corner of myrtle and broadway, just before half the bodegs in the area had closed, and another half had opened. I was coming home from an event, probably that weekly party I was throwing at Happy Ending, with a friend who didn’t seem to be getting the hint. He lived close by and so I took the buddy system opportunity to have an escort for the not so dangerous subway ride, and less dangerous block walk home. Little did we know that along that path we would meet a man who was not only insane, but insanely resourceful, a most dangerous combination.,I thought he looked familiar, reminding me of some friends in the industrial scene from years past, back in Boston, MA. I knew that some of them had moved to the area, and so I felt certain that we had met before. Doubt clouded my intuition as my friend and I approached the front of the line, and thus him, who was waiting for a sandwich to be complied behind the deli counter. As we watch he pulls a can out of a paper bag, and slams it down on the counter with a grin and says “here, add this”. It looks like dog food, that stuff they put in Sloppy Joes at public schools and summer camps, ground beef in some sort of sauce. He looks at us and says, “they do not sell it here, so I had to buy it next door and bring it over”. The flood gates were open. He kept rambling on, speaking at us rather that to or with, his nonsense had some sort of hypnotic effect. It was the last time I took, “you live in that house?! I’ve been wondering for years what it’s like inside!” as initiative to let anyone in. I looked at my friend, with a look that said, without mistake, do NOT leave. We all went upstairs. The stranger with his huge dog [ which later I found out he borrowed from his little brother to look more human and approchable ], my friend and I. We sat around listening to stories as the stranger crushed up lines of adderall pills on my tiny glass coffee table. It soon became bright out, but uppers effect me too greatly to just sit tight, or just clean the entire house. The three of us, and the dog left for his place to watch one insightful movie or the other for another 8hrs, into the day. Unfortunately, my friend was not as affected by the adderall, and decided to walk home soon after our group exit. I sat awkwardly on the strangers couch, mind reeling, concentrating much to hard on the movie. He offered me downers, explaining they were opiates and would allow me to sleep. I look them. I spent the next 48hrs vomiting. About a month later I found out they were some sort of generic methadone, meant to keep his younger brother off heroine.,In the following month, I would get calls and text ranging from 2 to 10 times a day about how he was walking by my house, and whether I needed anything. He would show up at places I didn’t exactly invite him to, saying he was in the area anyway. Nothing was exact, but nothing was accurate. I couldn’t call him out on anything, not even when his mother, conveniently wandering the city, meeting up with him, who was also conveniently in the city, when I was done with a walk-through I might have mentioned the week before. She seemed as confused as I was, he blamed it on her delirium, saying, “mom, you remember where I work! You’ve been there before.” The architects directory did not list him, nor his mail. The background check did. My roommate and I marveled at the 10 or so misdemeanor accounts listed in Floria, I contacted the one friend he had ever mentioned by name. He was also from Floria, but was now in Fort Greene. I inquired professionally, asking for a creative reference, of the musical persuasion, since our stranger had claimed to be in quite a few non-local bands. Negatory. I read the response between the lines, “stay away.”,As my next few responses to text messages became stern in unavailability and nondescript in location, his became angry, confused and threatening. He demanded to know why I was not telling him where I was, if not home. I became scared, looking both ways before opening and closing the doors behind me. I would see him walking around the block at all hours of the day and night. The phone calls from his number, blocked numbers, and even fake ones did not stop for days. Soon, pleading emails came in. In his head, we had become romantically involved, he had planned on proposing to me. My friends and I were aghast. For a second I thought, “maybe he took our complete lack of physical and emotional involvement during the one month were in contact to mean I was old fashioned?” but a second later I realized that would be insane. I felt sad for him, in between the rushes of fear. He was calling everyone in the room, whose number he had acquired with one lie or another. He was calling from downstairs.,After my roommate chased him out of our building, the stranger went on, stalking bodegas for someone who was less inquisitive and much, much more impressionable. Thanks to the one friend who forgot to block him on facebook, we know that a few months later he got married [the legality is uncertain] to a girl more than 10 years his junior. Their child is now over 1yr old.,On a lighter note, check out my favorite recent creep lifestyle video with man after my own heart, John Waters ::,The walk through industrial Bushwick seems neverending until I finally reach 513 Johnson Avenue, to meet Ryan Ford…and himself. That’s a joke I’ve been making in my head ever since I saw one of Ryan’s paintings, called ,Ryan is portrayed in blue boxer shorts in a ready-to-fight posture next to a huge flesh monster with several mouths, releasing what I believe are evil demons.,Ryan is a funny, laid back guy with a healthy sense of self-irony and a passion for good food. He’s leading me to his studio, we’re stepping onto iron stairs in an old factory building as he’s explaining how he saw this huge bald guy in a restaurant who had thick rolls of skin on his neck; Ryan decided to make a painting of a skinny vegan neck and a thick, fat “BBQ neck,” in a park. The painting isn’t finished yet, but it’s pretty hilarious already.,I can’t stop looking at the peculiar artifacts in Ryan’s studio as he, dismissing my objections, is serving delicious crackers, big fat black olives, ricotta cheese and a home-made iced tea, served in a jar filled with ice cubes.,I point my finger, as a request for an explanation, at a large pink mask with a number of tiny toy figures attached. Ryan inhales deeply, makes his typical grin and says, just like it was the most ordinary thing in the world, that it’s his shaman mask. Naturally.,I’m getting slightly distracted by the sweet pineapple cubes Ryan has served on a small painted table, while he’s explaining how he heard his calling–and, oh, did he hear it loud–during an art history class in college, when the teacher mentioned Native American shamans and their rituals. “That’s what I wanna do with my life!” young Ford exclaimed to himself. “I wanna be a shaman!” And he began  to research the topic thoroughly, as every young aspiring shaman should. Later Ryan came to a point where dusty books ceased to be enough, and he longed to practice his newly developed shaman skills.,So, every once in a while Ryan opens his studio to his friends, especially to the friends with infected brains, and he performs in a shaman costume and a mask he created for these festive occasions.,Ryan says that in addition to the rituals he read in books, he does what he feels intuitively.,And so this Saturday at his studio at 513 Johnson, #1 at 8pm, the fires will be flaming, infected brains will be purified, possessed bodies will fly in the air, and Ryan will laugh. You think I’m making this up? Come  to the Bushwick Shaman’s performance and we’ll see! All of Bushwick Daily’s ,!,We love the way Bushwick folks are eternally fashionable. Every Friday we’ll bring you a bite of Bushwick street fashion. Stay tuned, stay inspired!,We are loving this Bushwick graffiti/atmosphere video by Gracious Goddess on Vimeo. Enjoy!, from , on ,.,Promised Jesus after the jump.,I always wonder: who lives for those weeks of heavenly hell, when you are lucky to get 2hrs of sleep between having panic attacks and inducing them. On occasion I also wonder: who lives for the lulling weeks in between.,In the last 3 years, since moving to New York, I have found [as expected] a considerable increase in anxiety as a direct result of taking on too many projects. The truth is, the early stages of project hoarding, I begin to experience this sense of an elevated calm. It’s very difficult to explain this sensation in out of body terms other than using clichés such as “the calm before the storm,” but it is very similar to the floating sensation during the first minute of sky diving, [minus the deafening wind and ear pressure]. Maybe even closer in semblance to that last intake of air before you step over the edge of a cliff to plummet into a cold watery ravine [which I find by far more frightening than sky diving].,At times my mother has described me as a thrill seeker, dangerous unto myself; at times she’s even ventured as far as to call me a masochist. And while the latter can be held as truth on both physical and emotional levels, I have certainly not grown out of getting my kicks.,By now, you must be asking yourself, what exactly does this have to do with Armory Arts Week. This sensation, which I have now taken 235 words to describe is exactly how it felt to get involved in what is essentially a week long art faire, which like the fashion week, takes over every street in participating neighborhoods all over the city and brooklyn. It’s not exactly the Art Basel of Switzerland or even Miami [that would take too much silicone and stretch fabric], but it’s just as chaotic, much closer to home so to speak. Everyone is adding their twist on the fair, resulting in satellite fairs, private receptions, parties and carefully choreographed dinners, feet getting stepped on, and stepping on feet. Despite the its small size, I don’t think this city will ever get too crowded regardless the amount of talent it obviously holds, but at times it sure does have the persuasion of a pageant being held in you own back yard, or in this case, paved back lot. I mean that in the most endearing sense, that no matter how many dinners I walked into and how few people I knew, it felt like home every time. Whereas coordinating the events I was part of felt like the even hum of a tornado whirring within arms reach, the feeling of stepping through its spilling walls and flying debris left me exhilarated once inside, standing in the safe center of its conical walls, in mild anticipation of stepping out again and being left drained on the other side.,I used to think life was lived much like Dorothy had, waiting for the next tornado, or like Alice, poking around for rabbit holes. But in the last three year my perspective has changed; now digging furiously in gardens, and chasing tornados in a van.,This is a story about a girl who lives on the highest floor of a building that used to be a spaghetti factory. This girl gently closes her eyes when the shadows are changing into lights on her face as a J train greets Brooklyn on the Williamsburg Bridge. This girl loves how the costumes she has created sparkle during the grand finale of a Broadway musical show.  She rolls down the window of a huge car she’s driving to exhale smoke, and she turns on the radio. While walking in Bushwick, you have to smile when you notice glittery curbs, and dirt mixed with pink sparkles. You’re probably on the street where she has her studio.,This is a story about Tescia Seufferlein and her sparkly shoes.,S, might be the most popular sport in Brooklyn. Shoe tossing, or , is a practice where sneakers whose shoelaces have been tied together are thrown on overhead wires and cables so that they hang. A little bit of Internet research shows that this used to mark gang territories or places where one could buy drugs. But the newly arrived artistic community adopted this habit, perhaps not realizing the other meanings, and hanging sneakers have not disappeared from Brooklyn’s telephone cables. To the contrary, , has become a common Brooklyn sight., last year, the first rays of sun covered Bogart Street  in millions of colorful lights reflected by dozens of sparkly high-heeled shoes hanging proudly next to dirty old sneakers. I remember riding my bike underneath them and yelling with joy! To me, it felt like a beautiful Brooklyn chick had stood up to a bunch of stoners who hadn’t showered for three days and said to them: “Stop! Bushwick is going to be classy from now on.”,Bushwick girls started to discuss whether the sparkly shoes were their size, and if it would be too dangerous to climb up and get a pair. Bushwick guys started to Google “, like crazy, trying to find out who dared to hang them. All of  Bushwick was talking about them, taking photos and uploading them on Twitter and Facebook and blogs.,Many of the shoes were knocked down by the trucks driving to and from the factories in the industrial part of Bushwick, but Tescia says she doesn’t mind. Purple editions of the sparkly shoes appeared on the wires in front of the Bushwick galleries just ,And a here comes a sneak peak: soon we might get a spring edition of sparkly shoes!,
,And how does one do it? Simply. Watch the video that Bushwick Daily borrowed from Tescia.,

"All-volunteer organization , is promising a lot of fun and , this weekend in our beloved neighborhood. Performance artists, dancers and musicians will offer a condensed, two-day sampling of work at five hub spaces and a number of satellite venues. Make sure to pick up your map today, they are all over Bushwick, because , offers so much stuff that you can easily get lost! We invited the festival’s organizer, ,, to talk about SITE Fest.,You name it. If it falls under the performance umbrella, we’ve got at least a little bit of it. Performance art, durational and short form nature. Dance. Theater.  A lot of comedy. A lot of bands are playing. People are going to be doing public street interactions.  We even have writers interacting with artists, making live pieces in front of us in one of the satellite spaces…,On both Open Studios and Beta Spaces, we noticed that there were a lot of performing artists that were part of it. It wasn’t just visual artists. I am a performing artist myself, and I wanted to create a festival where I could showcase them. Often it’s a crucial thing for performers that they don’t have access to space to perform in, so I thought that Arts in Bushwick could use our existing relationships to offer space to performers for one weekend.,There are definitely a lot of performers. And it keeps growing every year… Site Fest includes both artists who live in Bushwick and artists who don’t live in Bushwick, but they are all happy to make work here for the weekend. I know there is a large dance and theater community based in Bushwick and over the years I’ve seen the number of performances and music shows increase.,Thanks to Open Studios and thanks to our long-term existence and good reputation in the neighborhood, and because of my own work as a performer at The Bushwick Starr, 3rd Ward, Chez Bushwick and Grace Exhibition Space, these wonderful organizations donated their spaces for the weekend, as they have done for the past two years. And I have traded performances,so there is going to be something going on at all hub spaces at all times!,There are five hubs: 3rd Ward, Chez Bushwick, The Bushwick Starr, Grace Exhibition Space and Goodbye Blue Monday and 26 satellite spaces, which are produced by people who wanted to curate and produce their own shows.,Gosh, that’s so hard. There is so much amazing stuff. I am definitely excited to hear , play at our launch party on Friday night. They are friends of mine but also I love their music and it’s great that they are going to be playing at the party, because they incorporate a lot of performance aspects into their band presentation. I am excited for , presentation, which is taking place at their house. And I am excited to see the relationship between the duration-based work at Grace Exhibition Space and sort of more momentary performances that are also going to be happening there. Some stuff is going to be 7 hours long and some stuff is going to be 10 minutes long. And we have three people who are doing street performances and one of them is actually coming all the way from Belgium to do it. Her name is Margarita Isola.,Three days after I spent approximately 10 hours shooting and two weeks in loose pre-production, I was back on set in my own home. Slash, studio. Slash, showroom.,This time I was the eye candy. , had been putting together a concept and mood boards outlining how I was to be an object within my own boudoir, a curiosity. Focusing on makeup, accessories and clothing which was to be worn as accessories, she put together three very compelling looks.,The make up for these looks was to be done by ,, a make up artist from Gillian and my hometown of Boston, Massachusetts. Where in many cases makeup is thought to be applied only to the face, the outline read:  feet and hands are painted and adorned with lace, ribbons and bows.,The morning of the shoot, the day after my actual birthday [ one I had been celebrating privately all week with boyfriend dinners and occasional fondus ] I woke up to to my phone ringing that they had arrived.,At 11am the three inspired ladies plunged into small vials full of brilliant pigments and soft brushes full of element only the chemists at MAC dare to concoct. 2500 watt bulbs filled the white insides of umbrella diffusers, and shone brightly on my face, warming me against the chill in the dining room native to this house. I embraced the attention, allowing for my mind to rest easy and my body to acclimate to the upright position I rarely experience before afternoon hours. Before I knew it, it was 2pm, sushi had been ordered, consumed, digested, and we were ready to set up the first set; we moved into the living room.,Look 2 : The Turret,Between Holding taxidermied jack rabbits and the long horns of a bull I steadied myself on tables and chairs, in,teetering heels and headdress crowns. Meanwhile the two ladies juggled cell phones, an SLR camera and an umbrella light mounted on a tripod.,The words “twitter” and “tweet” were heard as much as “look up” and “look down.” I knew a great many behind the scenes shots would be posted later that night, I couldn’t wait to see them [ and here they are ].,Look three was soon glued to my face. Twiggy eyelashes and glitter lips reminiscent of club kid days, but much more demure.,After we were done with look three in the studio room, I ran to the bathroom. I had a couple accessories of my own.,I put them on., Posing, all I could think was, “Move over Manson of 2001, I got this look down.”, on Saturday was simply fun and a party! Whether you were one of the hundreds who were at 3rd Ward or missed the party or the slideshows, I’m sure you will enjoy our selection of four slideshows that we liked very much. Here!,1. Postcards from Bushwick, by , of contemporary photography ,.,2. A little bit of Manhattan for Bushwick people who have already forgotten how the island looks like, by ,.,3. ,‘s project , explores the media-dictated cliche of female sexuality through images of women in pornography magazines distributed along Paradise Road in Las Vegas (Also, I want to marry that guy).,4.

It gets confusing and your own hopes and desires get in the way. Some even say you can go mad if you do it. ,–descendant of gypsies, psychic, artist, writer and drug-prevention activist–never reads for herself, either. It gets all blurry, she says. So I did it.,from an introduction to Katelan in her memoir, ,.,Kat has never fit into traditional social structures. In her early years she undertook a spiritual road trip accompanied by her cousin and best friend, Holly. She did a lot of thinking about life, society, her place in the world, and the things that are worth standing up for… Drugs would often be the key to the thirteenth chamber, a train ticket to take her and Holly places.,“,Chills run down my spine as I read parts of Kat’s memoir about the death of her first love, Brian, and then Holly. Each died of a heroin overdose.,Kat and I are sitting on the floor in her room. Her giant cat is soundlessly walking around, gazing at me every once in a while, as if she was trying to make sure her lady is being treated with all due respect she deserves. Kat is telling me how she had been looking for her and Holly’s diaries for years. And then, one day they appeared… In a room where nobody has looked in a long time. She pulls them out, one after another, from a drawer. My fingertips touch Holly’s handwriting. The air is filled with emotions, though neither of us admits as much with our body language. Pink old-fashioned wallpaper. Several decks of tarot cards. Nine glasses filled with water to honor the memory of the loved ones who have passed away. Katelan’s self-portait hangs on the wall. Five copies of , on the bed.,

, has toured over 40 cities in the world and this Saturday it is coming to , in Bushwick! The idea of Slideluck is simple. People come, have chili, beer, talk and watch slideshows showing art by local artists. Could there be a better way to combine art than with food and a party? Bushwick Daily chatted with Slideluck’s producer, who is also a Bushwick resident, Carly Planker.,Slideluck Potshow as a global initiative, as an art program it is about being inclusive, about creating a nurturing artistic environment. We are trying to bring people together instead of excluding people. A lot of art openings in New York feel cold. As you walk into a Slideluck event, it feels so friendly. It is about community experience.,It all started in the Seattle backyard of my boss, Casey Kelbaugh. Soon it started to grow, and now people just email us from all over the world to say that they want to have a show in their city. Last year was the busiest year we’ve ever had. We did the whole European tour; this year we’re launching Asia, Australia and New Zealand.,Yes. It’s simple. People like food, people like art, people like to hang out.,The last 4 events we’ve done in New York were called Slidelucks, as opposed to Slideluck Potshows. There is no potluck dinner where people bring in food. Slidelucks are smaller events. Slideluck Potshow would have 40 artists; and for an event like Slideluck Bushwick, there will only be 20-25 artists. The food will be provided by a chili cook-off, we have 5 teams competing. There will be one vegan and one vegetarian chili.,The Bushwick event is the beginning of our Brooklyn series. We will be doing other smaller events in other neighborhoods. Although, Slideluck Bushwick might end up being kind of big, because of the 3rd Ward space, which allows it; we’re expecting about 200 people.,Definitely, the whole Brooklyn series will be about younger artists. We try to sprinkle in few people who are already well established. On Slideluck Bushwick, we will have Rene Clement, Sarah Small and Nat Ward.,We were trying to keep the whole show under an hour, and we are trying to have a variety of slideshows. There is a digital projector that will project on a white wall. We have all sorts of visual artists showing their work. Also we have two artists from 3rd Ward designing victory prizes for the chili competition: Buck Jackson made a lathe bowl and Michelle Beaulieu made a big victory pin.,Art accessibility think tank , just opened its Active Space at 566 Johnson Avenue in Bushwick. The  plans Ashley Zelinskie and Jeffrey Peña have sound really great.  Bushwick Daily chatted with Ashley about the mission of Curbs &  Stoops, its current show, its artists in residency and the wall project.,My  partner Jeffrey started Curbs & Stoops about 3 years ago in San  Francisco. I joined about a year ago. Jeffrey started mostly showing  street art because that work in it’s nature was accessible.  For his  first public project, he took photographs of people on the street and  provided high resolution portraits immediately online.,The  basic idea is to make fine art accessible to everyone. Sometimes the  fine art world can be really pretentious, exclusive or really expensive.   We are trying to make art accessible. If you can’t be there, we’ll  help you to be there. I often go to art shows in Manhattan and other  places, and I take pictures, blog about the shows or stream them with my  phone.  I streamed Art Basel Miami, for example. I am trying to write  in a really simple way, describing only facts, avoiding judgments, so  it’s easy for everyone to understand.,Yes,  the space in Bushwick is our physical space. Right now, only the second  floor is open, but we’re renovating the gallery space on the ground  floor around the corner and the first floor. Part of the building will  serve as studios and will also experimental exhibitions, shows and  music. The third floor will be renovated next year. And then there is a  roof with an amazing view of the city; we would like to make it viable  to  host events up there.,We opened on ,,  with five exhibitions. The first comprises of two artists who are in  residency: Rachel Labine and Jonathan Chapline.  As a part of our  residency, artists have several opportunities to show in venues in New  York including our own. Noah Becker from White Hot Magazine will come  next month to review their work. The idea is to provide them with space,  exposure, community, and positive competition. The other featured show  was a duo exhibition with Brian Maller and Sebastian Vallejo, who have  their studios here. The “Island Hoppers” show was curated in response to  the rise of artists migrating from the Carribbean Islands to New York. And the final show is called “Suspended Animation… or Animated Suspension”.,In  April we will be building a curated mural wall wrapping around the  corner. It will be curated as a gesture towards our neighborhood. Our  conversation with the city. We will invite street artists or any other  artists who are interested in exploring this venue. The first  participating artist is our friend ,,  who did the murals for the Beijing Olympic Games and whose piece on  the Berlin wall sold for half a million euro. He’s donating prints to  the first 50 people who donate $ 500 or more to our Kickstarter  campaign. You can check out our , and donate. After that, Jorge Rodriguez Gerada will be doing a large  scale charcoal drawing exploring Bushwick’s identity on our facade. That  project is still in the works.,We’re hanging out in ,. Subconsciously, my teeth are unrolling the edge of the plastic cup, while my eyes are stuck to Richard, who is sitting across the table, casually sipping his coffee while he describes how tiring life can get–if you have to attend 9 fashion shows in one day during Fashion Week. Okay, I can understand, but it’s becoming super-difficult for me to hide my excitement. This feels like I’ve just been awarded a very early Christmas gift. In the universe of a fashion junkie, Richard is a god: Richard is showing the entire skeptical crowd that, yes, indeed it is possible to make it in fashion and to live your dreams. You just need to find a way to keep doing what you’re doing and tune out the less capable “friends” who advise you to give up.,Richard Haines is one of those miraculous people in fashion who made the leap from behind a laptop screen to the front rows of top fashion shows. Richard always wanted to be a fashion illustrator, and he established himself in fashion, but somehow his dream career as an illustrator wasn’t happening. So about three years ago, he started his own blog, where he’s been posting sketches of fashionable people he meets at random–on New York streets, at work, or while he’s getting his coffee. Richard’s blog, ,, eventually became so popular that  , hired him to sketch models during Fashion Week.,As I take my photos, and between talk about ,, ,, , and ,, Richard is sketching his fashion idol, Yves Saint Laurent, from an old photograph on the wall of his Bushwick apartment. I am silently admiring his creative mess: brushes, chalks, sketch papers, fashion magazines. My eyes stop on a photo of Richard in a Burberry trench coat taken by the Sartorialist himself, Scott Schuman.,Richard loves Bushwick; it’s easy to spot him in the neighborhood riding a bike, drinking coffee in Skips, or he might ask you about the new bar around the corner from his apartment. Wherever you see him, he will be fashionably dressed and really friendly–another Bushwick artist has found his dream.,View more videos at: ,.,Gabe Pressman of NBC New York visited Bushwick. Check out his reporting on our beloved “town in the woods” and its past, present and future.,Bushwick’s favorite cafe and our extended home , is celebrating its 1st birthday today!

"
,It’s snowing outside.  I’m in a strange home, (not) sleeping in a strange bed. The most stressful week of the most stressful month I’ve had in years has been magnified by a factor of ten by not speaking to you for five days.,Five. Whole. Days.  Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday.  Did I say days? It feels like weeks; months. Years.,In the course of playing the cards I’ve been dealt recently, I wondered if you thought of me. I feel alone, angry, abandoned. You made a very specific request for “space” (space? we’re thousands of miles apart) and I am determined to honor it.  ”Love, honor, respect, communication, cooperation,” those are the five keys to family life, according to my Dad.  I figure the guy who pulls off the 56 year marriage gets to have some say in what works and what doesn’t.,They’re saying it’s the worst storm in New York City history. Twenty-six inches in two days. There hasn’t been this much continuous snow since the winter of 1947, the year my parents married. I wonder if there’s a correlation.,It’s hard to break the attachment to relationships, even once you know they’ve gone bad. I believe we still want the same things, we’re just not willing to go to the same lengths to get them. I changed the rules for you, broke new ground, rewrote the script; you’re unwilling to do the same. Ghosts of scarcity and not raw unchecked desire still dictate your decision making process.,I’ve enjoyed a blizzard of emotional support from family and friends, and yet, without you it all seems like snowflakes on my tongue: transient, inconsequential.  Without you, nothing matters. I have always been here to listen, encourage, guide and protect you.  I’ve sat in silence and brushed your tears away as you cried in my arms. You choose to be alone, but know this: as long as I live you never have to be.,Did you know that the Inuits of northern Canada have forty-seven words meaning “this sucks?” According to Dr. Trisha Dean “language, like other social constructs, is environmentally influenced. The vocabulary of the Inuits reflects generations of living on frigid, barren glaciers.” Tingenek: this sucks. Massalerauvok: long ago, my son, it did not suck, but that’s not really true at this time. Mauja: for many moons, it has sucked. Now is no different. Akkilokipok: it is as if the great-snow tiger of suckiness has raped my sister.,To say “this akkilokipok” feels like grand understatement; the adjective adequate to describe both this god-forsaken storm and the morass our relationship has become does not exist in English or Intuit.,I choose to walk away. Clinging to anything after it’s stop nourishing you is unhealthy, and this relationship stopped feeding my soul long, long ago. There is a famine in my heart, caused by your decision to starve me of a love you created.,Tears and snowflakes, falling until dawn.,

,This is how I felt when I entered the Bushwick home of artist Mary Judge. It was a beautiful crystal clear day; pale yellow sunlight could almost make me forget about the icy snow cracking under my feet. I met Mary just a couple of days earlier, at the opening of her current exhibition at Storefront Gallery, and now I am standing in front of her house with my index finger on the doorbell. When she opened the door, I swear that the snow in a three-foot radius melted.,She directed me to her studio. I passed flowery old-fashioned wallpaper in the hallway, a wooded banister and cracking wooden staircase, to enter a large sun-drenched room full of neatly organized tubes of paint and painting brushes. Mary’s work hangs on the walls: tender flowers in soft pastel colors. Mary explains how moved is she by nature’s objects: a stone, a tree or a flower. When I look out of the window I see the backyards of a line of houses, a swing, tall gray trees sleeping under a layer of snow. Mary smiles.,She has traveled a lot, to Europe, Asia, Australia. You can feel the influence of her journeys in her house– a Japanese door, Italian curtains. Mary teaches at Parsons and giggles when she tells me she has a great life, full of social events. My blue cup is still warm when I place it empty on her kitchen table.,
The final week of , has just begun.,Happy V-Day! Show some special love to your neighborhood today!,By Natalie Keller Reinert,I’m beating her as we round the corner into the homestretch, laying my whip into her flank from high above my head, slap-slap-slap on her glossless hide. The rail is whizzing by close to my left foot, just at the height of my toe in the stirrup, and I’m dizzy with fear that my boot will rub on that hard metal rail and throw off my tenuous balance, losing what little grip I have on the little exercise saddle, or that the screech and vibration will send the horse spooking into the center of the racetrack, shaking me loose, into the dirt.,Either way it will fuck up the timed work and that is already going pretty badly. Just an eighth of a mile down, three more furlongs to go, and we’re nowhere near a racing pace. Slap-slap-slap, praying she’ll react, accelerate. Slap-slap-slap. She stumbles.,**,The horse is heaving and panting, making slow painful rounds of the rutted path of the dark crowded stable we call the shedrow. The hotwalker is texting, either his girlfriend back in Mexico or his girlfriend in Barn Four. Ordinarily I’d bitch at him, dangerous to have divided attention, that horse could spook or take off, blah blah blah, but it’s obvious that this filly’s going nowhere unless he drags her there with a chain across her lip, and anyway I’m too tired and disgusted to really give a shit about what happens to him. You can only chase these guys around so much and then it’s like, fuck it, get killed by some stud colt on ‘roid rage, see if I care. There’s a million more illegal immigrants lined up, begging for seven day a week, sixteen hour a day, way below minimum wage jobs. You’re expendable, kiddo.,I’m expendable, too, which is why I don’t go into the office to hang up my hat and safety vest for the day. I don’t need to hear Eddie give me a piece of his mind about the filly’s shit timed work, and I don’t need to hear Marcus, perched next to the heater with a Silver Bullet in his hand at nine o’clock in the morning, tell me one of his stories from his Hong Kong Jockey Club glory days.,The filly is dragging one foreleg slightly when she walks, but it’s tiny and I am the only one who will notice it.,I hang up my whip and saddle in the tack room, and stalk towards the train station still wearing my hard hat and vest.,**,C.J. Hernandez is riding her in the last race, the race the secretary writes for all the also-rans of a hundred sad slow claiming races, the race for the survivors who are looking for a little prize money before they break down. She falls at the half mile pole. She was already at the back of the pack, so no one steps on Casey. No one trips over the filly. He gets to live. A pile-up is avoided, at least for the moment. Little break-downs like this don’t even make the ,. They barely hit the blogs.,Casey gets up, brushes the clay off his white breeches, and waits for the ambulance to come and give him a ride back to the jock’s room. The filly picks up her head, and lays it back down in the dirt.,From my corner in the top of the grandstands, which hasn’t had a crowd begin enough to fill it in decades, I throw my beer bottle. It goes crashing harmlessly into the empty boxes near the balcony’s edge.,On my way out, shuffling past the cursing West Indians and the drunken old men, I see that darling of the racing board’s marketing dreams, a young girl with her well-dressed daddy. “Daddy, did that horsey die?” the girl lisps plaintively. Her father stammers.,“You better believe she died,” I tell her as I shove past.,**,But she didn’t. She’s standing in her stall the next morning, ears at half-mast, a wrapped foreleg hoisted sorrowfully over the straw. Eddie is leaning on the stall webbing, oblivious to the pigeon shit smeared over the rubber, crooning “Hey baby, come on and see your daddy, come on now babe –” Marcus is leaning against the wall drinking a Budweiser. He’s wearing a ridiculous yellow rain poncho that swamps his little ruined body, and his hard hat buckle swings loosely under his loose-skinned neck. It’s six a.m.,“She be fine in a few day,” he says to me. “She twist she ankle – no big deal.”,“She fell,” I say flatly. “Horses get up if it’s no big deal. She didn’t get up on her own.”,“Nah,” Eddie says, turning around. He smiles whitely at me. “Nah, shit, she’s just lazy. You know that. You gotta be hitting her all the time – you know she doesn’t wanna go ‘less’n you make her.”,“When I ride in Hong Kong,” Marcus says, voice gravelly with early morning alcohol, “I ride this filly, she donwanna go for no man. No man. She stop, she buck, she lay down in the dirt. I figure her out. I stand she up, let she look around, she go straight off and win for me. You gotta get inside they head.”,“You hear that?” Eddie says. “Marcus knows, he’ll help you out. Next week, get a good breeze out of her – she’ll race good then.”,“She can’t stand up,” I say skeptically.,“Oh we get her injected,” Eddie says. “That’s no problem.”,I look at the pair of them standing before the poor broken horse.,I grew up riding horses in America’s English countryside. In Virginia, in Maryland. Steeplechase horses, jumping horses, foxhunting horses. Tough, hardy horses. You knew how to treat them, how to keep them fit and strong through hard work. You never ignored a misstep, you never ran an alcohol-soaked towel over a dull coat to bring a false shine. You figured it out, and you fixed it.,This is Queens. Things are tougher here. The horses in Eddie’s shedrow are the same as the hotwalkers and the grooms and the riders: expendable. There are always more.,The filly limps into the corner of her stall and presses her face into the wall.,I can’t watch. I can’t get on anymore of these wrecks.,I won’t be able to pay my rent. I will end up on the streets. My mother will be right.,The next time she goes out, she’ll break down. And I’ll die.,I walk out.,**,She runs better the next week. She is mid-pack in a heaving mass of straining sad sore horses when she goes down. She takes three others with her.,A pile-up makes the ,Hell, it makes the New York ,.,I flip off the OTB channel.,**,There’s a four thirty a.m. A train I have to catch. I’m hotwalking for Joey Valentino in Barn Six now, and he starts work earlier. It’s a come-down from riding, but it buys bread and peanut butter. Valentino horses are gleaming and hot-tempered and mad with athleticism. They eat six meals a day, hand-mixed by a laughing, singing Jamaican man who has been working at racetracks since he was 12 years old. He says. Valentino horses don’t break down in cheap races. They don’t go down and die. He retires them to be jumpers, kid’s horses, pasture pets. He won’t put me on a single one of them, says I’m not good enough for his horses, but he’ll let me walk them and hose them off, and I take the job.,The siren on the racetrack goes off, and everyone in the barn does an instinctive head count of their horses. Do we have anyone out there? Could that be one of ours?,Everyone is in the barn; we were between sets of working horses. Rafael goes out to the fence to investigate. The siren can mean “loose horse” or “break-down.” It means the bored paramedics, listening to the radio in their ambulance, have work to do. It means everyone unfortunate enough to have a horse between their legs or in their grasp had better hold on tight in case something fast and loose goes galloping by.,Before Rafael comes back, the PA system crackles, sending my horse into a spasm of idiocy, and I hear, through my struggles, “Any available vet please report to the track.”,That’s it, then. Someone broke down.,The siren wails for a very long time. We’re all conscious of it, even as our horses settle and begin to walk semi-sanely again.,Rafael comes back inside. “Eddie Vernon’s gray horse. He die. And Marcus to the hospital.”,“Marcus?” I ask.,“Marcus riding he horses this week.” He looks at me. “Hey – you ride for Eddie before.”,“Yeah,” I say, jiggling the shank of my horse’s lead to keep him occupied. “Yeah, that gray horse, that’s Melodytime.”,“He die, that’s no good. Sorry.”,**,Eddie comes looking for me after training hours. I’m hosing out feed tubs, giving all the leftover oat hulls to the pigeons and the rats.,“Melodytime die out there today.”,“Yeah, I heard,” I say.,“Marcus broke his arm, his collarbone.”,“Yeah.”,“I need you.”,“No.”,“Come on.” Wheedling.,I don’t look away from my feed buckets. It could have been me. It would have been me.,Do you also wanna see your work published in Sunday Read? ,.,I woke up on a recent Saturday about 3 hours late. I had a note in my calendar to drop off the forgotten clutches of a dear designer friend from Boston, ,, back at her place around the corner, before cocooning myself back into my comforters and dealing with what was was amounting to be a three-day hangover.,I was awakened to her texting me: “Are you coming? I have to go to an art opening in 30 min.”,I jump into my non-pants while I balance my morning yerba matté on the sink, as I hurriedly brush my teeth, I start feeling akin to , from that British clay animation comedy I used to watch when I was 14, and stoned.,I call her. “What’s this show thing about? Never mind. I’ll pick you up in 20min, I’m coming.” It turned out to be the same , I’d gone to with friends, to see some sort of interpretive performance about occult symbolism or cult symbols–in the rectory of the church.,This time the show was about sound; appropriately titled “Sequence of Waves,” and it was quite loud. Here are a couple of shots I captured on my phone.,After climbing through a tiny tree house installation straddling one T intersection of the third floor of this rented out church building, I found one small, spiraling staircase leading down into what felt like a space between the floorboards.,It was very difficult to orient myself, I had to stoop to fit down the stairs, through a tiny glass door, which led to a paper-måchéd crawlspace, which in turn led to what looked like the newsprint-covered inside of an igloo.,Ten feet in diameter, the igloo’s center was tall enough to stand up straight, but there were others there too, so there was little room to stretch.,Sitting down, I noticed the sheets of paper covering the walls, the black charcoal spread over the upper two thirds, and the giant prismatic cross hanging, illuminated in front of us.,Once I made it through the tiny treehouse, on the third floor of the building at the end of a hallway, I saw one of my favorite installations. I think it was the only room to use natural light, which left me curious about its nighttime appearance.,Initially striking, details such as using various double-shot glasses with logos turned toward the back of the room made me pause and take a look around trying to locate traces of the artists. I found a disheveled girl standing in the corner, occasionally greeting acquaintances with quiet exclamations in the form of fragments, on the subject of meditation. I thought it was an accurate paradigm of the show.,I had some chai and salad back at Maya’s place in between breaths of encouragement about creating an installation at St. Cecilia’s Church for her next collection. I petted her roommate’s giant grey cat  as I  gathered strength to face the evening. I was going to the performance space and art gallery , I’d been hearing about lately.,I hadn’t looked at the program so I was quite surprised to walk into a minimal [compared to the afternoon affair] solo show by Steven Thompson. It brought me back to my friend’s senior sculpture project at Mass Art, which comprised only a wooden bench with pliers, large ,, and half taxidermied bits of animal husks. I looked around the room for evidence of fine art, and spotted a light beige garment hanging from the ceiling in the front room. “That’s awesome,” I mumbled as I walked past it on my way to inquire about the absence of wine. Long after leaving, the feeling of the bright overhead light penetrates my thoughts as I grasp for a greater meaning of the artwork, and I am still convinced that the answer lies exclusively in the poncho, or an interview; whichever I get my hands on first.,Check out the panoramic walk-through I shot on my phone, while at English Kills.,Also, check out my ,; sometimes I write stuff.,
,Bushwick Daily chatted recently with Jason Andrew, a Bushwick resident, curator, and everlasting art enthusiast. Jason runs the Storefront gallery, and curates a number of art, dance and literary events; he also works on his home-based gallery and maintains a daily gallery job. We talked about beginnings of ,, ,, and ,.,Right now we’re showing Mary Judge. This is her first show in New York in two years, and her first show since she moved to Bushwick. She lives around the corner. In the back room we have a show called Wavelength, featuring three artists: Judith Braun, Maureen McQuillan and Susanna Starr.,The newest project, which I am really excited about, was started by my gallery manager, Kate Wadkins, and it’s called ,, the zine department. I’ve always been a big collector of handmade artist’s zines. We will hopefully have a party every month celebrating a new zine. It will probably take over the monthly literary readings we used to have. I like the idea of giving zines a larger presence in the gallery.,I bought a house in upstate New York, and there isn’t a lot of art. As a New Yorker for almost 18 years before I moved, I wanted to bring art there, so I started a non-profit called Norte Maar. I organized a major ballet there with Julia Gleich, my collaborator and a co-founder of Norte Maar. We rented an ice-skating rink and converted it into a ballet theatre and invited a lot of friends.,
I moved back to the city when I got a job in a gallery as the manager and curator of Jack Tworkov. I came to Bushwick looking for affordable housing, like all of us (,). That was late 2006.  I walked into this apartment, where we’re sitting right now, and I thought immediately that this beautiful room works really well as a gallery, especially because of its proximity to the street and because of its natural light. So I started doing salon projects here: I would invite a group of artists, we would hang art and have a dinner party.,Later Norte Maar started to partner with ,, which produces the Bushwick Open Studios event. I mounted a show for that featuring three artists: Rico Gatson, Andrew Hurst and Amanda Trager. Through Arts in Bushwick, I became even more involved in sponsoring projects in Bushwick.  There were a lot of pop-up spaces and home galleries like Norte Maar, and Bushwick doesn’t really have a regular scene or a gallery stroll. So I started Beat Nite, which helps raise the visibility of Bushwick’s galleries. (The next one is February 18).,We started mounting exhibitions here in my apartment four times a year or more, and it grew to capacity. It was just too many people in my apartment, and there are only so many times your toilet will flush in one evening, it was just a lot…,
There is no separation between me and what I do, my projects, and promoting artists. We started to do ballets here and other modern dance projects, where I had some performing artists work in this space and everything was projected into the street. There were speakers, and people would walk by and watch their performance.,One of the artists I really wanted to show was Deborah Brown. She was working on a series of paintings called Bushwick Paintings and in this space I can only hang two or three paintings. And her paintings were pretty large, so we started to look around for a space that I could rent for a month. Deborah found the Storefront space and thought it would be a really great space to open a gallery. But it’s one thing to have an apartment gallery where you don’t have to go to work and pay rent. At that point I had never really thought about opening my own gallery. It seemed like it was impossible, but I decided to go with Deborah, and we opened Storefront. And we just celebrated our first year!,
Hell is carrots, you say at 12 am. I don’t think you mean it.,
The glistening wine that fizzles out of your lips,
when sleep congregates for other people, when the pillow,
never seems to call your name; questing for some elusive door to a TV show,
where your lust is a puzzle for another person to timidly approach.,
You’ve always wanted something crazy-famous to pin your name to.,
We call it Intervention.,Here is your third cup of coffee. The purple luggage under your eyes,
meets all travel regulations. Have another muffin. There’s no rest,
for the junkie now: fat diamonds dripping down your sallow cheeks,
from the metallic dreams you crushed in your fists. The beer aches,
for your hand and the eye drops don’t seem to ease the itching.,You weep like a baby in my arms and I stroke your cold fingers,
as if you are some whiskey-soaked kitten here for the warmth.,
I hold you and your head rages, the sinner inside you wails,
into a hurricane and the mirror we hold to your blood-broken face,
finally does you in.,
I want a woman with freckles,
dripping in her skin like a leopard’s coat,
like sunlight spotting the verdant earth,I want to name the constellations on her face,
claim her with titles reserved for the skies,
navigate her unknown terraces like Magellan crossed the seas,
touch the star drops on her cheeks with reverent fingers,An ocelot beauty,
I lust for her speckled breast,
I want to read with my lips;,my body itches for Braille.,Do you also wanna see your work published in Sunday Read? ,.","

"Ride home from the 2nd Avenue to Myrtle/Broadway the way I see it. God bless above-the-ground trains.,As I jump over a slushy puddle, I cross boroughs–from Bushwick, Brooklyn to Ridgewood, Queens. I am headed to Cypress Avenue where Chasidy, John and Donie rehearse on Friday nights. Listening to their freshly pressed EP on my iPod, I’m thrilled as I imagine how they will sound live.,Vividly Dim and are true locals. Chasidy, the band leader and princess, explains enthusiastically that she was born and raised in Bushwick,near Knickerbocker, and talks about how much things have changed. She vividly describes the sweet smell coming from a candy factory next door and how she used to get free candy at Christmas. Her grandma still lives in the same apartment–but the candy factory building has been subdivided into lofts.,I’m tagging along on a Wednesday afternoon while the gang is headed to Evergreen Park. It feels so nice, being part of the crew for an afternoon. The walk is hazardous: the snow occasionally drops from the rooftops, and the puddles are filled with thin pieces of ice. It feels like digging my spoon into a crème brulee when my step cracks the crust that has formed on the piles of snow overnight.  John and Donie are exemplary gentlemen, helping Chas and me. Chas and John have been in love for a long time now, and Donie, a tall guy in a Matrix-like black coat is their dear, remarkable friend and bandmate.,Evergreen Park is the Vividly Dim’s beloved spot. This is where they love to hang out when the weather is nice, and where they wrote most of their songs–while daydreaming, listening to Nirvana, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Sade or even Michael Jackson.,
The band finished the long-overdue EP during the snowstorm, but noted that the extra time they spent taught them so much about music and about each other.  Now seems like the right time for the new music to drop, because things are starting to happen for them. DJs and radio stations have been reaching out; they’ve doubled the number of Facebook fans; and they’re playing a show on Friday; and their EP release party is this Friday, at Good Bye Blue Monday.,We leave the park and head to Ridgewood Eats, the band’s favorite eatery. Over sweet-potato fries, the guys start laughing as they  tell me that they can’t describe the genre of their music. Independent? Rock? Even gothic was in play. Vividly Dim has become popular among Goths and Vamps–something the band appreciates, but doesn’t quite understand.  I feel a touch of eclectic and world music in their sound. But skip the labels and check out the music, and then check out this friendly bunch of locals Friday, when they perform their new music live, in Bushwick.,1087 Broadway, Bushwick, Brooklyn,(take J to Kosciusko),Friday February 4, 2011 at 8pm,One-eyed big fuzzy Matt has been proudly holding the title of showroom cat for some time now. And as a true artsy cat, he’s indifferent to the excessive display of affection by showroom visitors. He strolls by some strange new element in his kingdom full of art and peculiar artifacts–you–and with a genial nod of his head indicates that he might, if it occurs to him, bite. Meow.,With precision and ease, Matt jumps first on a vintage green glossy chair and then to a windowsill next to a tall white birdcage with plastic white bunnies in it. A blue-eyed girl with painted tears falling down her cheeks looks him closely in that one remaining eye and with one fingertip touches his nose.,Sunday afternoon rays of light are falling on Lena’s beautiful serene face; then to taxidermy on the walls; the light is merging with the crystals of a candlestick on the table, transforming the crystals into colorful lights.  Above a comfortable couch hangs white fur with red wine spilled all over it and a large kitchen knife stabbed in the middle. Lena is sitting on the couch, her hands folded in her lap. She holds her head with an elegance that makes girls and boys feel embarrassed by their own clumsiness in her presence.,Mademoiselle Lena, burlesque dancer. Lena Marquise. ,. She is one of the most artsy people you will encounter in the neighborhood. When she tells me about the latest art show she’s been to, or an artist she met, or about a particular piece of clothing she has discovered, or a painting she has just framed, I feel a flow of pure joy.,Lena loves installations. Not just installations that play with light and video, but arranging objects in their space. This passion inevitably leads her not only to create her own art, but to curate her own shows.  And the curator skin probably fits her the best. She’s got a nose for what’s fresh and innovative, for people bursting with creativity, and for inspiring spaces. Piece by piece, has been creating a unique showroom in her apartment in Bushwick.,What art does she want to get her hands on? Who are the people who inspire her most in Brooklyn? Which upcoming art shows are not to be missed? Lena will tell you herself every Wednesday here on Bushwick Daily, where her new column starts tomorrow. Don’t miss it!,By Maria Modrovich,Boats are out these days. You fly in.,You are mildly appalled by the drive from the airport. Really, these are the yellow cabs? Someone must’ve been eating a baguette in the back seat before you got in. Also, you can’t help thinking the driver is a member of a terrorist group. When he chats, it’s to distract you, when he’s on the phone, it’s to get instructions. You try to come across as amiable.,You wanted a cheap , nice hotel, this shithole looks nothing like the pictures on the website. You can’t understand a word the receptionist says. What a moron.,You let everyone know the coffee is terrible. Watery, without substance. Where can a person get a decent cappuccino around here?,You flaunt your clothes; you’ve got balls to be different. And to wear a little hat.,You’re armed with a Not-For-Tourists city guide and you know exactly what you want to see. You’re surprised how many people know about the best-kept secrets of the city. After you boxed your way through the crowded isles of Century 21, you decide to have a drink somewhere offbeat, like the Meatpacking District.,When you order beer, you stubbornly pronounce the name in Hochdeutsch, Praguer-Czech or wannabe Belgium. You also, also stubbornly, order from the busboy. He doesn’t understand a word you’re saying. You immediately add the boy’s ethnic group to the group of morons who are on Earth to make life living hell for you. Now you understand why this country is in crisis.,Your local connection suggests you meet on Avenue C. You ask if that’s in the city center. By city center you mean the area around your cheap and not-so-nice hotel in Times Square. You ponder whether your local connection is a bit on the moronic side, too, since incapable of answering your question.,The place you like most is Pain Quotidian, the one near you. You have breakfast there and afternoon coffee; its universality gives you an almost homey feeling. Couldn’t you meet there?,You walk to the East Village and arrive 50 minutes late. You’re stunned it took you so long. On the map, it looked like it was really close. And you really are a fast walker.,You don’t tip. One, the service is either moronic or annoyingly servile; two, where you come from, rounding off is considered generous. Why should you care about the local wages? Why change , habits? They’re supposed to be appreciative you came over here to spend money. Don’t they even start you on the hotel standard.,While sipping your Weizenbier, you like to discuss politics. So much shit in the Middle East. Why exactly did America intervene in Kosovo? And how does one win the Noble price for Peace with climate change? You bask in the shame of your American friends. They’re lucky to have you – to teach them to be critically aware.,Has anything been left in Egypt? You wonder out loud. Yes, you’ve been to the MET. For an art connoisseur like you it is a must. Although, compared to D’Orsay, Louvre, Tate, …, you know, what more is there to see, really.,On the way back to the hotel, you avoid the subway. You’ve seen pictures of it – they were in an art show – all graffiti and weird people; no trust has been built between you and the underground transportation. Someone might try to blow it up.,You walk about ten blocks in the opposite direction before you realize it. You are afraid of people mumbling to themselves.,You agree to take the F this time. You hold your bag close to your body with both hands. You can still remember how your camera got stolen in the middle of the day on Rambla. You wouldn’t want to be on this train, with these characters, after dark; that’s for sure. The guy sitting across the isle from you has innumerous mirror pieces attached to his ragged clothing; they’re flashing you when his meaty body jerks in the seat as the car moves. He’s smiling, you are afraid it’s at you. You run up the stairs into the daylight when the train stops.,It takes exactly one hundred and seventy eight pictures of Katz Deli and various fire staircases until you get to the place where you’re meeting your friends. It’s shocking to find out that everyone, just like you, is wearing plaid and boots. And a little hat.,After 15 minutes of close observation you start to feel inadequate. Their shirts are much more … audacious!  (Audacious is a word you learned from an essay on short stories that the professor of your Fiction I class had you read). In a painful moment of insight, you grasp that you’re sporting the plaid of seasons past. This throws you into a brief but deep depression, forcing you to inquire about the best, like, out-of-the-mainstream boutiques.,Thank god you’ve got your talent. You came here to make it, nothing less than that. Who would’ve guessed these people actually had things to add to your little lecture on Chekhov’s ,. You thought they were all just waiting tables.,For a moment, you ponder whether to give it a second shot with ,, but you decide to stick to chain-smoking your Marlboro Lights, informing everyone how criminally overpriced the smokes are and how fucking restricting the No-Smoking policy is. Good old truly liberal continent that you come from.,You laugh maliciously at a pair of French tourists who try to figure out where the Saturday Q train has taken them. When they ask if you could recommend a nice place for lunch, you advice them to go to PQ, pronouncing ‘pain’ as the English word for ‘sore.’,On the way from the train to the Polish restaurant, you pay no attention to the filigree staircases (although you kind of want to). You feel good; your shirt and skinny jeans are as hip as they get at Urban Outfitters.,First of all, you get coffee. A large coffee, please. In a mug.,You curse every foreign asshole that doesn’t tip you. Didn’t they read the guides? Why do they even bother coming here? Everybody knows waiters live off their tips.,Hello, no, you can’t smoke here. It doesn’t matter that it’s outside. There’s a marquee over your head (asshole!).,Finally, your shift is over.,You know you have almost made it; a few more weeks and the agent you flirted with at the Independent Lit Press Bar Ball will surely call to tell you how much they loved your manuscript. It’s a love story about someone who comes to America to make it and–,You don’t realize you’ve been mumbling the last sentences out loud.,On the train.,Full of crazy people, just like you.,To submit your literary piece to Sunday Read, click ,.,This clearly is a film. , plays the main role. An old record of Blondie is the soundtrack.,Scene 1,It’s dark and warm in here. We’re at an art opening in Bushwick at ,. Alicia is wearing a Lil’ Kim T-shirt and a long skirt. She throws a tequila shot into her insides, bites into a thin, dry slice of lime and yells: “You have to give your piece away. You have to get distance from it, so that you can look at it objectively, and we can create something amazing as a group.” , and I are looking at her painting: a sassy, dirty black-haired woman, licking her lips, maybe she even resembles Alicia. “XOXO”, the painting says at the bottom. That is how Alicia answered a request for a “,.”,Scene 2,This is most probably the coldest night in my personal history of Brooklyn. I’m slowly freezing to death as I’m walking towards the McKibbin lofts.  Alicia almost comes out into the street to greet me at the loft elevator, barefoot. She’s laughing about the absurd cold. This is her first New York winter, she is used to Januaries in L.A. Clearly. We’re both laughing like kids as I enter the elevator–me, covered in multiple layers of clothes, and Alicia wearing red shorts.,Scene 3,Alicia is hanging out in her loft; she’s playing an old record–Blondie, of course. Her roommates are chilling, watching TV and drinking beer, they couldn’t care less about Alicia dancing and doing a bunch of gymnastic tricks in the corner where she usually paints. Her roommate’s guinea pigs are being fed an apple at the pool table. A large self-portrait of street artist Quel Beast is hanging on the wall above the pool table. ,t has been the most influential person in Alicia’s New York life so far. He introduced her to the amazing feeling when you finish a huge painting, she says. To me, Alicia and Quel seem like twins, maybe; like two sides of the same coin. As if Alicia is the female version of Quel, and Quel is the male version of Alicia.,By day, Alicia works as an art handler at one of the world’s leading museums, and by night she paints in large scale. Tune in, because this girl is living the Bushwick dream.,

There is no message, other that these such artists works should be shown and collected just as sculpture, paintings and drawings have been. It took a while for photography to be accepted and I think it is the same with these newer forms.,The exhibition is called “Eye Transgress” and includes a series of 20 new paintings, new video, sculpture, drawings and other works by Nick Zedd. Nick is a legendary underground figure of the Lower East Side cinematic revolution “Cinema of Transgression”, a term he coined. He calls the paintings “Entities,” and they are manifestations of his “Theory of Xenomorphosis” – which is hard to explain briefly – but it argues that shocking images can transform more than the mind. He talks about the possibility of a super-evolutionary process leading to mutation through the injection of an alien genetic code. These paintings are also influenced by images of real infants born with a rare and usually fatal skin condition, so it’s a intersection of these two ideas.,I don’t like saying who is the next hot thing, because I don’t like to single out one artist. There are many artists that have been known for years and those are some really serious artists, but the art world catches up only years later. Take Jonas Mekas for example. He is 88 and has been making groundbreaking films since the 1960’s. Andy Warhol came to him to learn about films and the art world is starting to really recognize him only now. So you could say he is the next hot thing! (she laughs),Come and learn more about Nick Zedd. , will be screening 3 of his films on Tuesday January 25, 2011 at 7pm.","

"By Zuzana Kepplova,Meeting a vegan in the early nineties in Central Europe was an event comparable to a solar eclipse. I had the honor to meet one in person while taking part in an organized trip to the Baltic Republics. Fellow trip takers were so stunned by the presence of a vegan on the bus that they would stand in line at the bus alley to talk to her. They would share their food with the vegan and watch her eat it. The nights spent camping by the Baltic Sea were cold and the vegan refused to eat cooked food. So, people would bring her cups of wine, warmed up with their own hands. The vegan was permanently drunk. And constantly cold. Everyone was ultra protective of her. She was so pale and pure that one glass of wine was enough to make her drunk. Like a hermaphrodite in ancient Rome, she was special.,When the bus made a shopping stop, the mothers would send their kids to go check what the vegan was getting. The kids would run up to the vegan girl and more or less discretely inspect her shopping basket. Before anybody was allowed to touch their food, the parents would discuss whether this or that would be good for the vegan. The kids were sent to the vegan with small samples of food. Often, she would decline with a mild hand gesture and the kid would run back to inform the family that the vegan only wants nuts and wine.,The vegan had allergies to certain types of nuts. While our bus was passing by the beautiful white sand beaches of Riga, the adults were whispering the names of forbidden nuts. The fathers would write them down into their leather-bound notepads and the mothers would memorize their names. When by the fireplace, only the strongest young people with perfect teeth could sit around the vegan while she was telling the tale of her life. She was a second-generation vegan in the then Czechoslovakia. Something that was nearly unheard of. The menopausical women fainted and the people with high blood pressure were asked to leave and not listen from their tents. The kids were sound asleep by then and there was a changing guard making sure that they would leave their tents only when they urgently needed to use the toilette.,This is the moment when I would like to proudly announce that I was a personal friend of the vegan. I was near her when she ate and I assisted with the bottle opening. However, I remember only very little because the vegan was kind enough to share her wine with me. Those were very merry times.,Now, I would like to ask all the menopausical women to sit down and breathe evenly. Please, make sure there is no one with high blood pressure around or let them continue only at their own risk. Because the secret of the vegan’s shopping basket follows. It was full of the food the others would only touch after dinner was finished and the menopausical women made sure that everyone had at least three pieces of cake. The basket was full of FRUIT and NUTS; something that the mothers would encourage their children to throw to birds in zoos. And men were allowed to touch it only when soaked in alcohol. I remember an old history teacher mentioning that humanoids ate fruit and nuts.  He then wiped his thick-framed glasses and took out a schnitzel out of his lunch box.,I will be completely honest with you. I, the personal friend of the second-generation vegan, tasted some of her food. Under the influence of alcohol, deep in the forests of Estonia, while the moon was the only light, I had a bit of dried fruit and unsalted nuts. I do not want to speak about it anymore. Sometimes, when I bake and use these ingredients, I think of her ghostly cold white hands. We shared a tent during that trip. She was talking to me freely, addressing any topic without restrictions. I would listen carefully and make extra effort to assure that my response would amuse her.  I barely slept to make sure her blanket is in place…,An average looking man in jogging wear enters a café in the Village and ask for a vegan coffee. The man gets exactly the same paper cup of regular drip no milk just like me, only I wasn’t seeking attention by calling it vegan. People in this city have no shame at all. At parties, people approach me casually claiming they are vegans, munching on nuts and sipping regular coffee. They say, in a loud unpleasant voice:  “I cannot eat muffins! There’s milk and eggs in muffins. I’m a vegan!” And other people join: “I’m a vegan, too!” “Me too, I’m a vegan!” The room is often full of them. They inspect the muffins, spill milk into the sink and aggressively exchange recipes. “Who brought the muffins?”, they shout unanimously.,Let this be the moment of truth. I baked the muffins. I used two large non-organic eggs and a cup of watery milk. The recipe is freely available on the Internet. You have to type , into Google. I had to close the curtains while baking them. I went to a special non-vegan grocery store open only every other Sunday. And if you want to buy me a drink, get me an eggnog or a White Russian, please. I’ll be your personal friend. For this trip.,Bushwick Daily proudly presents 6 photographs by Ray Henders. Ray is a Bushwick resident, amazing photographer and a fine art printing guru. These photographs are the first installment of his work in progress series. With a Holga with PanX125 120mm film Ray captures Bushwick’s landmarks that are hiding a piece of history.,Not too many people know nowadays that until the night of July 13, 1977, when a major blackout occurred in New York City, Bushwick was experiencing a retail and residential flourish. However, arson, looting, and vandalism followed the Blackout. Bushwick saw some of the most devastating damages and losses. While local owners in the predominantly Puerto Rican Knickerbocker Avenue and Graham Avenue shopping districts were able to defend their stores with force, suburban owners with stores on the Broadway shopping district saw their shops looted and burned. Twenty-seven stores along Broadway had burned. Only unsafe dwellings and empty lots were left after the riots among surviving buildings. Bushwick was left with a lack of both retail stores and housing. Residents who could afford to leave abandoned the area. The neighborhood became a hotbed of poverty and crime through the 1980s…,

,How good would it feel if you woke up on a Sunday afternoon, pleasantly hungover, digesting incredibly awesome circumstances of the entire amazing Bushwick weekend, turned on your computer to check what’s new on Bushwick Daily and there would be a beautiful, new, well-written piece by a young writer of an overwhelming talent? It would feel simply awesome, right?,That’s why Bushwick Daily is now accepting literary submissions for a new column ,. Fiction, creative non-fiction, poetry, experimental prose, you name it. The limit is 2,000 words. Add also couple of words about yourself and send everything to ,We’re looking forward to read your submissions!,Happy Martin Luther King Day, everyone!,It has become a good Bushwick tradition that every third Saturday in month, all the good-writing-and-other-arts admirers meet up in , and are enjoying a group placebo effect of a large projected fireplace. So did we last night and I swear that during the fourth edition of the Bushwick Finest reading series, I felt the warmth and I could smell the burning wood more than ever. Maybe it was because the most wanted duo in the literary Bushwick, Mike Lala and Eric Nelson announced that Fireside Follies came into its finale… I know, I know… But remember: “Big girls don’t cry!” so I won’t cry and you shouldn’t either. Besides, Mike and Eric promised to come up with “something huge” this spring, so let’s see if they can beat their own success. Honestly, they won’t have an easy job; during its four editions Fireside Follies multiplied the number of the people in the audience several times, the line up was constantly awesome, and Mike and Eric were simply funny.,
,This month’s all-star lineup included a poet Tom Oristaglio, a novelist Justin Taylor, a comic artist Julia Wertz, a poet Eileen Myles and a novelist Arthur Nersesian. Writer Andy Smith who we saw reading on Fireside Follies #3 came as a DJ this time.,Tom Oristaglio reciting his poetry.  And if I were way cornier than I actually am, I’d say: Pay attention to this your poet, for he’s got the fire in his blood. In the best Fireside Follies’ tradition. But obviously, I am not , corny.,The second to read comes Justin Taylor. The author of ,r and ,a novel coming out next month.,The comic artist Julia Wertz is super funny! Make sure to check out her autobiographical comics  ,y (before she changes the name!). ﻿,
,Eileen Myles, the author of a poet novel , reads a joint poem with her girlfriend ,. Yup, the cutest couple of the night. By far.,The last to read is the author of 9 novels, Arthur Nersesian.,It was pretty crowded in the audience….,

Bushwick, Brooklyn,* Similar content appears also on ,.,Good morning, Bushwick!,Well… right here, from the top of the page, I should probably warn every lost soul surfing the internets instead of panicking somewhere on Meserole Street in loads of snow due the increasing celebration insanity… I am listening to nostalgic, smootchi, fuzzy, my-puppy-got-lost type of music. It sorta brings me to reflect on 2010 and on where I am going, who am I, whether I’m enough and whether the world is enough (I mean, it can’t be just me, it has to be also them). And what about mankind? I might even shed a tear for the orphans in Chad…,In any case, 2010 was crazy. Painfully crazy. Full of ups and downs. And I have astrology to explain this. Apparently, it wasn’t entirely easy for the most of us and it’s the universe to be blamed for the turbulences. Despite it all, there is one decision that I tend to call the “Decision of 2010” and that is moving to Bushwick. Out-of-Bushwick residents tend to blow Bushwick off, because the streets are not as pretty as, let’s say, Greenpoint. (At this point, I would like to make a small tiny point that among all the mess you can find on the streets, some items may be violently inspirational for photography, painting or simply for funny conversations with your friends. But that’s not what I want to write about). Bushwick isn’t about ugly streets, houses or the M train. Bushwick is mainly about the people and their stories; about inspiration; about being a bit naïve and going against the rationale of the strict uptight world. It is about hope, hope to make it, hope to do something meaningful with your life and spending some good time while at it. Bushwick is about inspiring others and letting others inspire you. Bushwick is about community. Unlike other places, Bushwick can still cherish the community sense and the people supporting and carrying about each other. And I am more than happy to be part of it and to be able to do my share by writing about what’s going on in the neighborhood. Bushwick Daily started like a simple photo blog, but is quickly becoming more than that. The site is becoming a platform for people to exchange their ideas. It is also a window for people who are contemplating a move to the neighborhood or others who are simply curious about what is being cooked in Bushwick. Furthermore, after the 1, contributor Pepe Lopez, also others of you expressed an interest to join me in creating the content. I heard completely awesome ideas and I cannot wait for 2011 to make it happen!,To conclude this post before I start crying and cause some irreparable damage to my laptop keyboard, I’d like to thank to all ,:,musician, tap dancer and Bushwick’s most favorite alien ,,,great story teller, blogger & writer ,,,amazing coffee shop co-owner & the greatest sweetie ,,,amazing Bushwick people’s soul thief & photographer ,,,punk ziner, writer & Fireside Follies co-curator ,,,musician, host & the prototype of a Bushwick resident ,,,always cheerful and curious photographer ,,,artistic coffee creator & the saddest eyes painter ,,,essayist & frequent awesomeness embracer ,,,(and a true beast, Quel Beast).,Many thanks go to Bushwick musicians ,,,,,and ,!,So let’s get this party started and may 2011 be the Year!","

"Photos by Robin Grearson.,I hope you spent the snowed in time in Bushwick with good people.,Dear Santa…,You know that feeling when you have so much to say about something, you really can’t decide what to say first and you get stuck? Hmm… You’re saying you don’t know that feeling because you’re a great multitasker thanks to all the practice with the rain deer navigation and all the presents you deliver? Well, Santa, I am strongly tempted to say ‘screw you’ but then again, there is a slight chance you exist and as a result of my foul-mouthness, I would be cut short of the presents this year, so I’m not saying anything… Maybe only that, dear Santa, I think… you might be Eric Nelson…,
,The third installment of ,, Bushwick’s most beloved monthly reading series, was simply great fun! With the pride own to my Bushwick heart, I have to say that Fireside Follies is becoming an awesome cultural event and a show-view of art being created (not only) in Brooklyn. After last night, Fireside Follies are officially not only about readings, but also about music, visual arts and omnipresent community sense. When Eric Nelson and Mike Lala, the curators, introduced ,, a singer and an autoharp angelic tunes player, I felt a little bit like I was taken back in time to San Francisco in the 1950s, I swear I nearly stood up from my chair and yelled: “Yeah, guys, let’s do it; let’s merge the arts together; let’s get rid of the concept of the forms of art and let’s get mutually inspired.” Just like ,, does it. Katelan is a visual artist, a writer, she is a member and a founder of several artists collectives and a drug prevention activist.,Last night’s line up included Brandon Lake, a poet extraordinaire from South Philly, who presented his visual poem – a set of double exposure black and white photographs.,
,Elizabeth Devlin performed and premiered a music video from the 7″ Vinyl ,.,
,Andy Smith read from his book ,
,The night of pure mind pleasure was concluded by the headliner Matt Gross (,). Matt quit his full-time job and moved to Cambodia for some time to write a travel novel about Cambodia in 1950s. The novel got never finished, but we heard a piece from it.,

							,I promised to post these kids from high school on Meserole St.,Puerto Rican houses on Central Ave are furiously decorated. Shinning snowmen, thousands of blinking Christmas lights conveniently purchased in a nearby Family Dollar store, Christmas carols playing from a shitty speaker ran by a tiny engine made in China, despite and because of it all. ,, , Dear peoples of the Republic of China, let me, on behalf of the peoples of the Republic of Bushwick, thank you for this holiday experience a la acid.,Huge bright squirrel sitting next to a dumb face Santa has a determined look in its eyes, as if it was trying to make sure, by its intensive presence, that this year’s holiday will not cut Bushwick short. Because it could happen easily, I am realizing together with all my Bushwick neighbors and their decoration. Bushwick is not exactly in the center of attention, it is dangerous at times and ugly always. “This not a good part”, tells me a Bangladeshi cab driver when dropping me off in front of my house. “It’s better than you think”, I oppose.,We are poor, some of us proudly, others shamefully. Cocktail of December gloominess, delis, tacky hair cutters and experimental art, which is making kids who smoke too much weed laugh hard. I slip on the first Bushwick snow when walking to or from the bar.  I’m listening to the new Kanye West album, a copy of which I have provided myself with, because I was told he’s the shit, and there is nothing innovative about rock anymore. I’m generously ambivalent about him. Although, he sounds kinda more sophisticated than the last time I checked, and , moves me. Too much innovativeness can be bewildering and to the contrary, the lack of it can be soothing, especially in the times of Venus in Scorpio. I guess, I will always be an indie rock chick.,The people who will conclude it’s a good idea to talk to me in a bar, will receive an unsolicited advice not to drink straight from a PBR can, because they might, you know, die.,The Industrial poetry of Meserole Street is smudged when I sprint past by the warehouse where the guys from Navegante rehearse every day. “It’s all in your head”, Jean Shepherd, yells in my headphones. It feels like there is a fourth dimension to their music. Short breath, my feet are in monotone frequency touching and untouching the ground. Inhale, exhale, wet hair underneath my hood, I am driven by the energy and restlessness of ,.,You’re tired and drunk when walking home late at night and/or early morning. Thoughtlessly, you take a short cut through the warehouse area in Bushwick. That’s not your habitual route home, but some inexplicable force is taking you there. Too tired to fight it, you just follow. Smell of dirt, rain is mixing with the smell of boiling rice. You take a peak through a large hole in the wall of the rice factory. There are a hundred people dancing, going insane, rough music rolling from a large speaker. Your ear canals are vibrating, your eyes stuck to the florescent photographs on the walls. You melt into the crowd… ,.,Jean hands me a roll of toilet paper as I am sitting in their studio. “I strongly advise you to put it into your ears. Cause this might get loud…”, he smiles friendly. I briefly look at Wash Duke behind the drums waiting impatiently to start and obediently fill up my ears. Suddenly everything changes, the air vibrates, Navegante fills up their rented space to 120% percent with energy. I can’t stop looking at Wash smashing his drum set. I feel like I am observing some secret spiritual ritual, like I’m invading his intimacy.,Once the set is over, their faces change, just like nothing happened. I begin to be curious about why there are only two of them. Jean explains that they used to have more members, but as the time passed it turned out that it’s not entirely easy to find people who share their mind set. The people who are willing to put everything aside and focus just on music for a year and half. It takes time and self-discipline. “It’s all in your head.”, I am thinking about their song. They played for a year in a club in East Harlem. To find their sound and to practice. “Playing live makes you think quick. What do you do when something goes wrong? You have one second to fix it when on a stage.” I am asking about Brooklyn clubs. Jeans says that when he moved to Brooklyn, he was amazed by the quality of the bands playing in Brooklyn. The clubs would pay one band to play the whole night and they better be amazing. Nowadays, there are so many bands out there that the clubs are booking four or more bands per night and they don’t care how the band sounds like because the bands are basically required to pay for their own show. And the quality goes down rapidly.,The guys further explain that they have created this effective 30-minute long set to open Rye Rye’s show ,. This will be their last show for some time now. They plan to disappear for the winter in their Meserole studio and finish their second album. To taste a hint of what is coming, you can download their , or come to Public Assembly on Wednesday.,Stay warm, people!,Good morning, Bushwick fellas. I am reporting from the warmth and coziness of my favorite coffee shop. I hope you are on the same vibe, enjoying this rainy day and all you need is a good read. Turn on your Christmas lights, get yourself a nice mug of cofee and browse through this awesome online book ,by Henry R. Stiles originally published 1867.,Did you know that Bushwick was called Boswijck in the 17, century and was settled by Dutch farmers? I know. I’ve done myself at least 4 “awws” by now.,Lofts and machinery… sounds almost like water and poetry to me.,
,She’s singing accompanied only by her acoustic guitar in a café somewhere deep in Bushwick. She’s beautiful and melancholic.,After the 4 minutes I spent breathless, I glance at the people at the open mic asking myself if they have also noticed that this girl is way better than anyone else that has walked onto an open mic stage with a guitar, just like that. ,Her name is Elli Perry and with southern accent, she explains she has just returned to Bushwick after 2 months in Georgia. And she’s happier than ever, spending all her time in the studio recording, working and creating. She’s got plenty of great material to work on.,Elli is charismatic, it feels almost as if the air surrounding her was full of electricity, you can almost hear it buzzing. ,We’re walking on Broadway towards Greene. She’s got a guitar on her back, white coat and black mittens. She’s telling me how miserable she was, nearly got sick, she couldn’t stand it anymore and had to leave the city.,But now Elli is back. The curse has been broken, the frog has been kissed, the universe has send the right vibe and now here she is knocking on the door. She has been spending all her time in a studio working with the technicians Rob Guariglia and Scott Harris, who besides the fact that are Elli’s great friends are responsible for Elli’s single “Standing in Place” that will be released in January. Elli gives me her iPhone headphones and lets me listen to it. It’s sweet, beautifully polished, and Elli has never sounded better. “This single just might be it…” I’m thinking.,It’s a late fall afternoon, and the air is cold, making our noses red when we reach the People’s Garden. It’s a garden like I’ve always wanted to find, a garden I used to read about in my childhood books, but I never knew of its existence, until now… Definitely, I wasn’t anticipating it in Bushwick. Old fashioned toys, Christmas lights, blues music blasting from the speakers and a chicken walking around. The garden keeper sets up a fire to warm his hands. Elli is laughing and doesn’t know what to play with first; she says the garden feels like places in Appalachians where she grew up.,Elli Perry will play an acoustic show in , on December 16. All songs used in this article are from her first album “The Secret To Scaling A Mountain” She’s also on , and on ,.,It’s been some time since the Ring Cycle at The , ended, and I can tell it felt even longer. But alas! Miserable Bushwick Starr-less hiatus is over, dear art junkies and Bushwick Starr premieres new piece by , company just tonight! And I went to check out the preview last night.,First of all some important practical good news: Despite the cold weather, the Bushwick Starr is nice, warm and cozy. So don’t hesitate and bring your dates, grandmothers, tax advisors, guinea pigs or just… friends and feel free to melt into your chairs.,is a dance/ theater/ installation/ chance operation comprised of 30+ segments presented in random order every night. The segments include acts of mayhem and panic with a plot about possible invasion and some high energy dance numbers. You might see scenes from the TV show “V”, blind-folded wresting with a frog, random babbles about lost virginity and not calling your parents.,Somehow despite all the uniforms, lizard costumes that the performers are wearing and the catastrophic video installations, I can relate to the message so much. In fact the play is about me. And about that girl at the table next to me. And about that guy on a bike. And most likely about you too.,Witness Relocation at the Bushwick Starr, Brooklyn, December 2010.,Directed by Dan Safer,

"The back yard of , gallery , happens to be experiencing an interesting time, space and art slot. , and , of , were working on this graffiti as part of the All City , Block Party on November 20, 2010. As we can all imagine, the Block Party turned out to be way too much fun, and the guys finished the graffiti only couple of days ago. As a result, only a very few pairs of eyes saw the finished awesomness on the wall of Factory Fresh and with the upcoming show, the graffiti will be painted over, as a good tradition of the gallery.  Luckily, my fish eye was one of the few eyes. Enjoy!,Tek33 is visiting from the UK and Dscreet from Australia. With the rest of the Burning Candy Crew, they are currently making a new film Dots, which follows each artist on a journey around the world, as they visit the places and cultures that most inspire their artistic style, in order to discover how they can take their own work further. Not content to go about making a documentary in the traditional way, Dots is directed by The Baron, one of the formerly elusive members of Burning Candy. Drawing on his own prodigious talents as a graffiti artist and filmmaker, the Baron is able to access this closely guarded underground scene with a level of insight that few, if any, other documentarians have been able to achieve before.,To fund the film, Burning Candy produced a limited edition box-set of nine prints, one from each artist. These highly desirable sets are bound to become collectors’ items immediately – Mighty Mo recently released a set of prints which sold out in less than two hours. The box-set also includes a certificate of authenticity, which gives the owner a 0.05% share of the film’s profits for the next 10 years. In this way, the profits from the prints will fund the film.

His voice sounds blasé and he closes his eyes and lifts his nose every time he pronounces the word “art”.,“And no. You clearly don’t know the secret. The secret we , know. All art school graduates.”  I’m wrapping my head into a pillow. “Christ, why is this person interrupting my sleep?”,The bearded douche bag leans even closer to my pillow and whispers: “The secret about fine arts you need to know is…. that space for the articulation of intention needs to be created and reality has to be manipulated in a non-manipulative way…..”,The gulps of dry air nearly suffocate me when I quickly sit up in my Bushwick bed. Cold sweat on my forehead, alarm clock buzzing like crazy, my heart pounding in my ears. I look around my room, the bearded guy is gone. Luckily.,Maybe it was all the discussions about art I had with , lately and maybe it was just an excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages last night.,But how will I know if my work is art again? It has to manipulate intention of reality to articulate space?? I quickly google the key words of the phrase. Nothing relevant comes up. Couple of clicks until I find a web site called ,? Only to find out that there is an iPhone application, which will instantly instruct me whether a particular product of my work is art of not. Now take this, bearded plaid  guy!,Last weekend I chanced upon an out-of-luck doll, standing un-clothed and unarmed in front Police Service Station 3, on , in ,. I asked her how she came to her unfortunate state of affairs and she told me her story. Her name is , and she came to , to seek her fame and fortune, but wound up running with the wrong crowd… It wasn’t long before she found her self walking the streets at night to make ends meet. The Sunday morning of our encounter she had just been released from a holding cell without a scrap of clothing on her back, or a solitary cent to her name. I offered her the slightly less exploitative job of , in exchange for bus fair to her family farm back in Kansas. It turned out that she was a natural for modeling — no useless arms to clutter up the highly artistic shots, and a fixed expression that seemed to tell the tale of her hard times. She’s back on the farm now, and as far as I know, Bushwick is already a ,.,I feel the look of a large yellow red head from a drawing of , on my shoulders and on my chest. It’s heavy. My throat is dry and swollen. It somehow gets harder to breathe freely when standing in front of the ,. I feel the pain, disappointment, temporariness, desolation and surrender. She’s staring at me as a silent witness of a near impracticability of finding someone compatible with you and even if you do find that person, you have to let them go most times for many reasons.,Women are the most frequent motive of drawings and the source of the deepest emotions of James Marshall. Eyes of each of them transmit a different vibe. From mother, through a good friend to his latest infatuation…,James draws them with pastels, charcoal, ink, sometimes with water colors and assorted pencils.  He says there is something indisputably elegant about drawing the line of hair with one line. James developed his technique purely empirically and through experimentation. He is fascinated by Francesco Clemente.  He never went to art school and is proudly self-taught: “Art school is good in teaching you the business of art, but who are they to teach you how to feel your art?” James says it took him some time to accept the title “artist”, bringing him to reflections on what is art and what does it mean to be an artist. Does it mean you have a diploma from a fancy art school hanging in your bed room? Surely not. Despite being a very loyal Bushwick resident, James is an individualist and doesn’t identify himself with the art scene of Morgantown. Instead, he derives a lot of inspiration from the concurrent music scene.,James was born in the Appalachian Mountains. His mom, who used to be a hippie, has been a great influence on him. He spent 2 years of his life traveling in the States, camping and attending conferences and seminars of the non-violence movement. Afterwards, in the very hippie fashion, he arrived penniless to Bushwick to pursue his art.,To see the series of drawings of James Marshall, come to ,, where James will have an exhibition starting on December 10.,…but he better try harder.,

Never mess with a man in a fedora.,“Wait… I’ll show you…. this photo….”, Rafael Fuchs is going through a slightly disorganized pile of framed photographs leaning on the wall in his Bushwick studio. You can end up looking for Rafael’s studio just like a grandma looks for her glasses that are sitting on her nose. The building on Bogart Street clearly and phlegmatically says one word: “fuchs”.,It’s kinda hard to believe that a man who created the brand ,, photographed Mike Stipe, Pink, Collin Powell or J.K. Rowling, exhibited his work in Ace Gallery or Ad Hoc, and won numerous photo awards is hanging out on Moore Street, buying organic vegetables in a store near Morgan stop and making amateur videos of Die Antwoord who came to Bushwick for a photo shoot. But yeah, here he is… A bit absent minded, super friendly, curious, inspired by every single detail and excited about life.,“Ah, here it is. So look at it…”, Rafael takes off the bubble wrap paper from a large photograph and sticks it right in front of my nose. I see a guy, doing a victory sign standing on a roof somewhere downtown Manhattan. “Hm”, I am a bit puzzled. It takes a couple of seconds for my brain to recognize everything in the photo. There are the twin towers burning behind the man on the rooftop. I feel cold sweat and shivers running down my spine. I realize how provoking the photograph can be. Rafael explains that some galleries love the , and some are offended by it. Rafael says that the man in the picture is showing two fingers not for victory, but for two towers being down. What is a better portrayal of New York life than reactions and gestures of a bunch of people randomly hanging out on a rooftop on Bleecker Street, while an event that we couldn’t comprehend is happening at the background?,I look at the American flag casually folded and sitting on a chair in the corner… Rafael Fuchs isn’t about big words, statements and patriotism. Rafael Fuchs, originally from Israel, is living his life the way it comes. Day after day, minute after minute… He consumes what America serves. His book,  , a collection of raw unprocessed photographs taken throughout Rafael’s extensive travels, is evidencing this.,While I am looking at the photographs on the walls of his studio, Rafeal is cooking. I protest that I am not hungry, but Rafael, with his ,dismisses me like a kid who doesn’t know what’s good for her. “I studied holistic health. One should eat well. It’s very important to eat roots.”, and I have to admit, Rafael clearly knows what he is doing.,As much as he travels, he always loves to come back to ,, between the warehouses and factories where the home is. He adores the neighborhood, he loves how vast it is, he likes how you meet much fewer people on the streets than in Manhattan, which allows you to get to know them way better.,The time flies by quickly. I couldn’t believe it’s been a month since I attended the first of the , reading series. My feet were taking me down the familiar route “warehouse on the right, warehouse on the left” to my most favorite fire place in Bushwick, ,.,Mike Lala and Eric Nelson, the co-perpetrators of the finest Bushwick reading series, were tempting all the bookworms to come by a stellar constellation of readers: ,, ,, ,, Danniel Schooneebek, and Alyson Paty.,Cassandra Katsiaficas is a founding member of Numu Arts Collective, poet, painter, jewelry and big plans maker.,
,Danniel Schooneebek and Alyson Paty have a collaboration poetry project going on. They write so called “torch poems”. Each of them separately writes 5 lines without discussing it before hand to come up with a sentimental unrequited love poem. In addition, both Danniel and Alyson read their own poems. Danniel frequently experiments with form. His work includes poems in the form of itinerary, manifesto or apology.,Melissa Broder is a shiny poet star! She reads couple of poems, some from her book ,, and some that were published elsewhere. To listen to Melissa’s poems is like to hold two fingers on the pulse of the city life, todayness, sarcasm, pop culture and generation of 20 something.,
,Christy Road sits in the front row. She is a punk with Cuban origins. She is holding her latest illustrated novel ,, manuscript of her upcoming piece and a laptop. She explains how ,is an autobiography. It’s s story of a gay woman from a Cuban family recovering from an abusive heterosexual relationship coming to New York. While reading, Christy projects her illustrations. Her confession takes me aback with its frankness, Christy is direct, simply describing reality the way it is without any pathos or sentiments, causing me shivers on the spine. Her illustrations remind me of a comic noir, enhancing the effect of the story. Christy is true and has so much to tell through visual arts inspired into writing.,
,Saturdays Fireside Follies made me happy, indicating the way it could follow – in line with the spirit of the neighborhood, exploding with truthfulness, creativity, confession, new forms, exploration, extreme, erasing the line between the forms of art.,(Similar content appears on ,),….the more the better…,

You probably live in , and you keep bumping into people with the same vibe all the time. Sometimes you think you must be going mad right at this moment, because it’s in the air. It buzzes, the neighborhood vibrates, you feel it with every step, you feel it with every portion of oxygen you fill up your lungs with. There are many amazing things to be created.,There are bands spending their food money on recording studios. Rehearsing in the basement all the time. Going crazy when they get to play a show. That’s why we’re beginning a cycle about ,. Connect to bands and musicians that are about to happen right now…, are a cult Bushwick rock-and-roll trio. Frank Rathbone, the frontman, guitar player and a vocalist says they met about two years ago. “John Swanson, the drummer, moved to my building and on the very same day we met on the stairs, I asked him to play a show with me. And he said yes.” Later on, at a show of some lame band, Frank met Gillian Visco, the bass player and a vocalist. “The band sucked,” says Frank, “but Gillian was super-excited about their pink bass. And so I asked her if she wants to play a bass in my band.” “And I said that I can’t play bass”, Gillian joins the conversation. “But Frank said: Sure you can. And I was like: Really? and I was so happy at that moment.” And that’s it.,
They have an amazing chemistry among them. All three of them compose their songs. Somebody has an idea, comes to a practice and they work on it together. “I never finish songs by myself,” says Frank. “I always half finish them and then the whole band works on it.”,Photon frequently performs in Bushwick. You can see them playing at Party Expo, in Little Skips or catch a glimpse of random members rocking at an open mic. It needs to be said that if Photon performs outside of the neighborhood, Bushwick people migrate like birds to Africa all over Brooklyn, even to Greenpoint…;-),Photon sounds like a bike ride underneath the above the ground subway and like the pure joy of living in Brooklyn. That’s where they get their inspiration: simple earthly Brooklyn pleasures, friends, bikes and roof top parties. You can taste Gilian’s songwriting influence when they sing about the absurdity and pain of love. It’s not an exceptional day when the entire Party Expo is shaking because the audience is singing the name of Frank’s girlfriend (yes, that’s one of their songs).,The Dynamo gang is just recording their second album. To download their first album , for free, just click ,.,
Gillian has been truly inspired lately and her distinctive songwriter’s voice called for a separate project.  The band is concurrently working on “Gillian and the Shiny Pieces” album, which should definitely not escape your attention. (= secret tip wink wink).,I mean… This is pretty simple. Without certain particular things and people life in Bushwick wouldn’t be as colorful, as entertaining and as …. Bushwicky as it is now. And thank god for them! You know, Evergreen Avenue wouldn’t be so much fun if you didn’t have a bike and couldn’t ride it down happy as a kid. Bushwick wouldn’t be as beautiful without a sudden slot between two warehouses that offers amazing sight of the Manhattan skyline that surprises you again and again on Cypress. Most certainly you grew fonder of Bushwick because of the rain deer graffiti on Troutman. And if Frank Rathbone, a musician, a guitar player and a frontman of a cult Bushwick band Photon Dynamo and the Shiny Pieces moved away from Bushwick tomorrow, the entire neighborhood would have to close down. For sure!,Frank gives you a high five or a funky hand shake whenever you meet him. Frank buys you a brownie when you keep forgetting to eat. Entire Bushwick migrates to different parts of Brooklyn whenever Photon plays outside of the neighborhood. Frank hosts an open mic and encourages all other musicians to come and play. Frank simply is and you want to be his friend. Frank is simply a Bushwick icon and a prototype of a Bushwick resident.,I’m sitting on a bench on Bogard Street, sipping my latte and observing crowds emerging from the Morgan subway stop melting into Bushwick. It’s a perfect autumn Sunday, you couldn’t possibly ask for a better weather. The air is crystal clear and the sky is ridiculously wide and blue. Bushwick is vibrant today. People have been carrying obscure objects, preparing, assembling, attaching blue posters since the morning. The art festival Beta Spaces 2010 is about to start.,Under the lead of a volunteer organization ,, the visual artists have opened their studios, apartments, lofts and galleries to the public. There are 50 locations and more than 400 individual artists participating. Ali Ashman, the lead organizer, curator and an artist explains that Beta Spaces is a self-organized festival where all the participants are responsible for their show. Despite the large number of participating artists, there are recurring motives, common themes and ideas, such as a notion of home, recycled or found materials and visitor involvement. Frequently, visitors get to participate in the show and become part of the art creation. You can have brunch at Marni Kotas’ house or you can have your broken piece of art fixed by Jefferson Orgy Body. You can play a GPS scavenger game or observe virtual objects alongside reality using a smartphone application.,Bushwick is bursting with creativity and you cannot remain uninspired when exploring warehouse labyrinths, talking with artists and curators. The festival manifests how massively rich the art scene is in Bushwick and how incredibly unique is this neighborhood with such a large concentration of visual artists per square feet. But art creation is not the only motive of the festival, Beta Spaces provides a platform for a dialogue on the role and impact of the artists in the neighborhood, the neighborhood changes and gentrification.,

"Today was simply perfect.  I’m glad I spent it wandering around Bushwick and exploring open studios of many artists living in the neighborhood. Refresh your daily dose of Bushwick also tomorrow to read how was this years Bushwick art festival, ,.,So I’m riding my bike, enjoying autumn Bushwick like never, inhaling the Indian summer rays of light, the blue sky is wider than ever, I swear. When I turn to Bogart Street, I am mesmerized by millions of colorful lights that are being thrown all over the word by sparkly high heel shoes hanging from the wires. Whoever did this, I love you! You made my day!,Brook Pridemore performing somewhere deep deep in Bushwick. (Ok, performing on Thursday in Little Skips ,Dear people, Bushwick Daily happily presents new video of a Bushwick band, Photon Dynamo & the Shiny Pieces for our concert favorite  “Five Dimensions”. Also if you want to see them live, come to , tomorrow at 8pm.,I start laughing out loud on a late night L train. A bunch of drunk people, currently not listening to their iPods with loud punk music, turn around curiously, frowning their noses with a question in their looks  “Who’s laughing? Why laughter all of sudden?” Raising my eyes from the book, I look at them in appeasement, my look saying: “There’s nothing to be seen here, people, go back to your drunkenness. I am just finishing one but last short story from The Silk City Series by Eric Nelson.”  They seem to have understood, nodding and moaning with boredom, they give me a look back saying: “Ah, right, just a book. We thought, maybe some action…” But I am not listening to their looks anymore because I’m reading again.,I’m in the Silk City, Paterson, NJ where a writer Eric has taken me. I’m standing on the sidewalks while a nervous mom walks by me with her 15-year old son, both in Sunday-church level of attire, headed to ask for money from her father she hasn’t spoken to in years. And I’m observing Italians hugging each other after a huge fight over a broken air conditioner because they’ve been ripped off. I’m in a hospital observing Uncle Punk hallucinating about Gowanus on his death bed…,Eric started to write these stories after his mother died. He went back, collected, recalled, dusted the memories of his childhood neighbors, his mom, the poverty, the families struggling, trying to stick together, fighting and finding each other again… All in a dreary environment of a working class of Paterson.,Having the pure punk in his heart, he started to publish the stories as what was to become an acclaimed zine series.  Shortly the zines came to the attention of a publishing house and became a ,. Neat. So… how did a boy with a blue collar New Jersey background without an MFA degree or any special connections publish a book again? Oh, right, he writes like a punk. He patiently plays a game with words while he scribbles into a mole skin at night, he comes to work early in order to rewrite everything on a computer. He joins a , where he meets  others. He volunteers at , zine library. He organizes ,, a Bushwick reading series where every writer would kill to read. And right now he’s editing his next work of what he calls “satire on art and urban transplants”.,Simple. In a way.,

"As a natural born gentleman, he lits up her bong while she’s inhaling the smoke dense of THC and carefully holds it a bit to the side so that her nose doesn’t get burned.,-”So you live in the neighborhood?” she asks while slowly releasing her lungs muscles.,- “Yes, right there on Noll.” he points to the dark.,-”Oh, how cool. Me too!”,-”It’s a nice street….I hear.” They both laugh.,-”So do you have any roommates.” She asks while he’s lighting a bong for himself this time.,-”Yeah, I have four roommates.”,-”Oh, that’s quite a lot.”,-”Yeah, but one lives in the closet.” He briskly offers an explanation.,-”What?

And if he doesn’t close the door, he can stretch his legs… He’s got it nicely figured out.”,-”Neat.” she replies and demands her turn of the bong.,It’s a mid-July afternoon at Bushwick’s Myrtle Avenue. The above-the-ground J and M trains are racing each other in production of industrial noise and delivery and/or removal of the peoples of Bushwick. A , truck in the nearby shade has just reached this season’s top level of sale of Colombian chicken. People are walking, bumping into each other, buying fruit flavored ice cones, cheap jeans and used electronics, their talk is melting into a chant… A hipster chick on a bike wearing shorts causes a small revolution among the topless bodega guys playing domino in the shade. A large white SUV, windows down, just stopped at the red light, proudly provides its addition to the general summer sticky craziness on Myrtle Avenue and it feels like entire Bushwick just started to vibrate in the rhythm of latin pop.  The lights  turn green, the engine roars, driving god knows where, uncovering a young Parisian photographer Axel, who just for a second, overpowered by the heat on a camping chair, closes his eyes behind his trendy Raybans; Canon 5D Mark II left rested on his lap. His hip assistant Ryan is just talking to an old guy who lives 2 blocks away on Broadway. Axel took a photograph of the guy only a couple of minutes ago.,Axel has been making portraits of the Bushwick people on a white background for a couple of days now. White background isolates each single portrayed model from the summer intensity of Myrtle Avenue. Suddenly, every single feature, every single thought, feeling and a unique story of each person portrayed by Axel talks to you from a photo in its quiet, but intense presence.,Axel shakes hands with the old guy who then melts back into the Bushwick everydayness like he just hasn’t been placed on a stage alone to tell his story and tell it over and over forever on Axel’s photograph.,Axel is a French photographer who came to New York years ago to pursue what he is best at – portrait photography and to enjoy the bitter-sweet life of a freelancer. Soon he discovered Bushwick, which became his home, inspiration, very own private third world and a melting pot bursting with creative energy. In July, he had a simple idea to portrait Bushwick in its ugly beauty, which soon led to a bigger project than one would imagine. Axel is currently preparing a photo-exhibit and a book to be published.,Stay tuned to Bushwick Daily for more about the development of this extraordinary project.,There is 12 billion bikes in the world, thanks to mainly Amsterdam, Trondheim, Beijing, Copenhagen and Bushwick.,A street bike can unintentionally become a very personal item. Usually, people don’t find their bikes, the bikes find the people; through some awkward, strange, maybe suspicious or even funny, fate-changing circumstances. Usually, we’re not the first owner of the bike and the previous owner wasn’t the first owner either. But each owner of the bike adds something personal to it. Either a funky flashing light,  or a magenta tape on the handle bars.,Just try to think of the story about how your bike found you. What season was it? How did you feel when you rode it for the first time? Who was the previous owner of the bike? What’s the story?,

"everyone and i mean everyone IS in love with this song. ok, denying the denial… Bushwick Daily too…,It was at least 200 degrees outside and a real estate broker just took me and my roommate to be to see the scariest apartment in Bushwick you can imagine. “It’s alright, that ceiling is not falling, it’s just a shadow that creates that impression.” “And yes, this apartment comes with a complimentary Puerto Rican flag. …and a grandma.” It was starting to be clear that Bushwick wasn’t such a good idea (sic!). At that moment, the only possible shush answer to the worn out, tired, dusty and whiny me was an immediate increase of caffeine in my blood. A cute little corner coffee shop came in handy. Cozy, art on the walls, great music, macbook crowd, amazing coffee and a petit smiling girl behind the counter…,Approximately 20,000 coffees later, I knew Linda Thach and the story of how she created Little Skips; a café, which can’t even be called the second home of the most young people living in Bushwick, because it’s their first home, it’s virtually their living room.,Linda is a cute little spirit, and the original little skipper, with roots in Cambodia, she can’t fight something eternally positive about her personality, even when she’s tripping from fatigue. But don’t get confused by the little girl look, being very down to earth, together with Henry Gluckroft, Linda manages her own business at a very young age and is a friendly boss to a handful of employees.,Little Skips is certainly one of the reasons why Bushwick, as we know it, is expanding from the L train towards Myrtle Avenue. Furthermore, it’s a place where the local community meets and works together. It’s a very unifying Bushwick spot where ideas are discusses and are brought to life.,Maybe you squinted last night until 3am with the flickering light of your $9.90 Ikea lamp only to finish the latest novel by Nicole Krauss. Maybe you got so inspired last night, you didn’t go to bed at all and the day light hit you at 7.15 am like a hammer making you realize it’s time to shower off the writer’s sweat and go to your day job. Maybe you already developed a chronic wrist pain because you believe keyboards kill creativity and scribble your Bukowski-inspired novel with tiny neat handwriting into your green mole skin day by day. And maybe just your bookworm Bushwick heart desires to slowly melt into a chair as you’re listening to a well written poem while the fire patiently consumes the forest wood in the fireplace…,In any case, you should have been there!

Close your eyes and let your brain slowly recognize layers of cinnamon, clove and cardamom. Feel the gentle late summer breeze on your face and comfort yourself in a large red garden chair on the roof terrace of the Bushwick apartment of the writer Jackie Summers. You are about to hear a story. A true story. A story about how nothing compares to happiness and about how nothing hurts more than the pain only love can bring…,It was about a year ago when a director of production in a popular woman’s magazine, Jackie, decided to give his stories a more tangible form and start a blog. He wanted to tell stories about how the real New Yorkers live and love.  Forget Carrie Bradshaw, forget the glamour, turn off the TV show about New York that was made in Hollywood and cross the Williamsburg Bridge. Listen to the slam of the door in a Brooklyn apartment, listen to the long orgasm moan, watch a couple hold their hands….,After a brief chitchat with death, Jackie decided to leave behind a job that wasn’t making him happy and to focus only on what is really important – to live well and to listen to his call. Currently, is this Bushwick-based New Yorker having long conversations about love with his friends and is writing a book based on his popular blog, ,., ","

"depending on how open is your consciousness to the receipt of broadcasting of the outer space civilizations when walking down knickerbocker, you get to meet temporary inhabitants of planet bushwick. Joe is an alien fox who smiles a lot and landed in Brooklyn under the pretext of music composition. he is interested in interaction with humans and observing our relationship rituals. he likes roses and dissolves quickly if your frequencies don’t match. Joe’s musical excursions will take you to a different galactic and spiritual spheres. he plays a fender guitar and tap-dances at the same time. he frequently performs in bushwick and elsewhere in brooklyn.,http://www.myspace.com/protein20g,people residing in Bushwick are amazing. different, unique, friendly, supportive of each other, crazy talented with a strong sense of community. therefore, the idea was born that every tuesday there will be one of them featured on Bushwick Daily blog. the first bushwick resident is a musician Joe Davenport. to learn more about the upcoming features, follow , or shoot us an email (bushwickdaily@gmail.com) if you want to be featured or if you know someone who should be featured., ,Happy Columbus Day everyone!,Hipster; when I look it up in the dictionary: hip-ster: a person, esp. during the 1950s, characterized by a particularly strong sense of alienation from most established social activities and relationships. Now a couple of days I spent in Brooklyn, brunching, partying among the hipsters did give me the strong sense of alienation…about everywhere else I had been…except Brooklyn.,Spending time with the hipsters boosts your artistic talent. In Brooklyn, art is in the air and you grasp it with every breath. Now don’t get me wrong about Brooklyn art. This is not the noble art white people have imposed on us; the fancy French label for culture. Dead masterpieces locked up in museum confinement, rotting on shelves, decaying on walls. Brooklyn art is alive; an ,art yet with every touch of sophistication. When you set off on your scavenger hunt looking for it, you need to have the eye to spot it. A tattoo here, piercing there, an outfit, a flashing light, an exhibition in a being held out in a factory, an amazing dance being performed on the street, a graffiti masterpiece, an unwritten story being told by a writer in a Bushwick apartment or a small concert at a local club…hipsters were performing everywhere.,the word itself sounds very artistic, yeah, hipster sounds very hip; modern. Hip-ster; the hip part make it sound sexy and could very well work for a jeans brand. I picture it on a billboard like the one for Levi’s I saw today over at Times square with a picture of three juicy booties and quoting: “All asses were not created equal” hell no! Hipsters are very different, as if pertaining to the same tribe, you can spot them, you can categorize them yet there is no conformity. It’s neither the tattoos not the piercings. There’s something about the peculiar hairstyles, the bird nests, the extremist-looking beards or the 1980 porn star moustache, but it’s not that. The clothes, the styles will definitely draw your attention. Some stylish, others seem to have walked into the thrift shop around the corner and randomly picked a $50 outfit, but I guess style is a matter of taste…and taste had no borders in Brooklyn…and unlike Paris, Rome or Milano, here, you could break all the fashion rules without getting arrested. The only one thing possibly identifying the hipsters was the spirit; the creative artistic, rebellious spirit. Modern day hippies, bohemians who settled in Brooklyn (when I asked my ex girlfriend if they had hipsters in Queens, she said no)…most of them will never make it, but they all dream the same…they all strive for success.,Ever since reading Elizabeth Gilbert’s Eat, Pray, Love and her story about how she finds a word for each city – that word would be in the head of every person in that city and if you wanted to fit in then you had to have that word carved in the back of your mind as well – ever since then I find myself thinking of ,You see I live in Prague, a nice, small, cozy city in Europe, rich in history, culture, and architecture…modern, medieval and ancient. Prague, a gorgeous city where the women are pretty and the beer is cheap…thus making it a perfect place for ,. I would definitely choose pleasure for Prague and would put that ahead of ,, , or ,It is definitely fun, if you’re only here for a while, but after some time, pleasure stops being fun, yet it’s still pleasing, and you still find yourself doing it. Pleasure in Prague simply becomes a routine. Some find it in sex in a puritan city where everyone is so liberal, others simply find their pleasure in drinking beer and crawling pubs…here it’s just pleasure, no game, no foreplay.,In New York City the world is definitely ,And this was a tough one to figure out. And I’m not sure if this is because the city is so diverse, or if because I was trying to find one word for Manhattan and the boroughs. In Washington D.C. the task was much simpler. The word for D.C. is ,The fat politicians in their black suits decorated with U.S. flag pins, soldiers in their uniforms decorated with medals, foreign diplomats…they were all leading. Even those serving leaders, were second hand leaders and were therefore leading. D.C. was all about leadership. Twelve year old students were shipped to D.C. to attend leadership seminars.,Success is the word I would use for New York City. Everybody I see here is celebrating success and the city is humming. Everyone is successful in New York City. If you’re a white collar working long hours in one of the upper floors, above the clouds, congratulations, you are successful, you made it. If you’re a businessman here in a city humming with opportunity and killing competition, congratulations, you’re successful. If you’re a scary looking foreign cab driver in Manhattan, congratulations for managing third world driving in a first world city, you’re successful. If you’re an illegal immigrant behind one of Manhattan’s many Deli kitchen sinks working from dusk to dawn, congratulations to you too buddy for hooking up a job, you are successful. If you’re unemployed in this city, looking for a job, you’ve made it here, you are successful. If you’re a pedestrian equally crossing on red and white lights and are still alive, congratulations, you are successful. If you’re a tourist here, you’re definitely successful for having made it here, visiting this city is like a pilgrimage, congratulations. If you’re a firefighter here flashing your lights and boosting your sirens so that at least the sound of you gets to the scene on time while you manage to fly over the yellow carpet spread over the avenue lanes, hey, you too are successful. If you are the illegal Egyptian immigrant selling hot dogs of a cart on 5th and 42nd while cranking up Hakeem, you ARE successful. Success here is simply everywhere, and you don’t even have to look for it. It will hit you in the face. Success is on the neon signs and giant LCDs on Time square. It is being played in Broadway shows, celebrated in rooftop house parties and danced to in the clubs. In fact, everybody is so successful, nobody seems to mind the $20 cocktails or the beer being sold at a dollar a letter (PBR – $3, Corona – $6, Heineken – $8…) and therefore even getting drunk becomes a success. In fact the vibe of success is so in the air that they even had to open an army recruitment center right on Times square. Brief, in New York City, the glass is always half full. , Of course this overwhelming vibe of success in it’s concentrated dose has a meditating effect. But coming to New York you contemplate and reflect upon your life. This could have two possible impacts one you. The overdose of success will discourage and depress you. The overwhelming atmosphere of success in the city will demeanor you, belittle you and reduce you to nothing. You will feel so insignificant in NYC that you will hate it. Of course you never liked driving on the fast lane and would rather just cruise steadily down your life…hell no, NYC is just a crazy madhouse where everyone is just running around like a chicken without a head. You feel like a total loser and all you want to do is jump of the Brooklyn bridge and take a nice cold dive into the east river or if Brooklyn bridge is not your favorite cup of coffee, maybe the Manhattan bridge or any of the many bridges or even subway stations in the city…again there’s endless opportunity.,Another possible impact is that you try to point out the success in your life. In this case NYC becomes a wholly trip and every step you take down Broadway and up 5th Avenue inspires you. You lay down on the grass at Brooklyn Bridge park, find inspiration in Central park or simply look for success in the vast horizon off the Empire state building…briefly…an empire state of mind.,Now whether you arrive to NYC, whether by boat, car, train, bus or subway, as soon as you pop out on the street it is as if you got handed a pair of 3D glasses you get at the movies and put them on. All of a sudden you’re aware of a 3rd dimension. Yet apart from the overwhelming skyscrapers, or the breathtaking concrete jungle built to be proportional with King Kong, there’s another dimension to the city. This fourth dimension is the exact opposite of what you would feel if you would visit Venice. For those of you who have experienced Venice, you might have noticed that time seems to have stopped for this town. Venice seems to be living in a totally different time zone, where the clock has stopped ticking.,NYC is on a light speed time axis, where time shrinks and all you do is keep trying to race it. In NYC, everyone is in a hurry, rush hour or not. Fast food places don’t even seem to have seats for lunch breaks and nobody waits for the white pedestrian lights. In NYC even the tourists are in a hurry…so if want to zap through your life, come spend it in this city.,Now I can’t count the times I’ve been to New York City. But I’m starting to realize that visiting NYC is just like having sex; good sex. The pleasure is indescribable, the details are volatile, but the experience is thrilling. Spending time in New York City is just like satisfying an instinct, eating after long hours of hunger or quenching thirst. The aftertaste is impressing. Every time you have it makes you look forward to the next time.,But my favorite in New York City is the Brooklyn Bridge, for no particular reason. I’ve tried to observe this bridge, just to understand why. Comparing it to the other bridges, there’s nothing particularly gorgeous about its architecture neither its location. For some reason I could live and die on this bridge, make love on it and sleep underneath it. After all, it is a bridge to the hipster world…,experience lovely existence.,Call your mom, cuz somehow that’s what makes moms happy. It’s Saturday morning and you’re no good for anything anyway. That dog’s barking is tearing your brain and vividly bringing back last night’s memories of  whiskey + beer special. You thought it was a good idea and economic at the same time. But guess what? You were wrong.,So be good and call your mom., ,merry friday, dear bushwick fellows and bushwick friends! i had some other picture prepared to be posted today, but then i saw this woman in a supermarket at Myrtle Ave and couldn’t resist the temptation , ) apparently, in Latin America, parrots are one of most common pet and people walk around with them on a shoulder or head like this all the time. I say, cheers, Ecuador!","

"Dear Bushwick fellows, by writing this article, I  feel like I am destroying a hidden oasis, not known to the civilized world yet and very soon tons of cool-clothes-thirsty people will destroy the fragile equilibrium and the magic of the place. But to remain silent isn’t an option either….,There is a tiny vintage clothing store on Central Avenue and it belongs to one of my greatest and favorite exploration achievements in the neighborhood so far.,Just a couple of minutes off the L train Morgan stop, on the  corner of Flushing Avenue, almost invisible to the untrained eye, there is undoubtedly the awesomest vintage clothing store I have seen so far in Brooklyn. In what used to be a garage, Sue, a Bangkok-born Bushwick resident for over 30 years now, sells the cutest dresses, tops, shoes and accessories.,Sue has a surprising sense of fashion and style. An old charismatic lady listens to Diana Krall while stitching together her own old dress she bought years ago in Thailand and a jeans skirt from Urban Jungle. She is interested purely in female fashion and every piece she sells is individually selected by her and altered if she thinks it’s necessary.,If she likes you, she will take you to the back room and you will see endless hangers of lovely pieces by Valentino, Banana Republic, Club Monaco, Pinkyotto or Prada. Nothing costs more that $15, but it might happen that she will refuse to sell you the cutest dress ever, because she wants to copy the cut and make more dresses like that. Pity.,Sue refuses to go big, although she has enough clothes to do so. She opened the store because she loves fashion and because she has a soft spot for local kids, as she says. She likes to help them to look great for little money, because she knows they are just starting in life and don’t have Wall Street jobs.,Sue is a great story teller. It’s worth to just pop by her store to hear how the neighborhood looked like 30 years ago when she was scared to walk on the streets after dark and strongly preferred Manhattan. But during the past year, she saw more and more young people walking around Central Avenue and thought it would be a good idea to open a store. It was an awesome idea, indeed!,The store doesn’t have a name yet and if it’s closed you could never tell it from a regular garage, but if you’re lucky and if you walk with your eyes open, you’ll get to meet Sue and her amazing clothes.,merry sunday to you all, bushwick fellows.","

"my favorite way of explaining how to get into the super cool garage taqueria is that you walk all the way on Jefferson and turn left by the Bambi graffiti. Bambi is a cult street art work nearby the Jefferson subway stop. It is one of the works that defined the neighborhood. It is one of the works that shine in my mind when somebody pronounces the word “Bushwick”.,[,cool thing about bushwick is that julianna barwick could walk into your favorite coffee place right now.,change the angle of your views and you might see…colors!,have you ever tried riding a bike and holding an umbrella at the same time?,it’s a cliche rainy monday in bushwick, but let’s not get grumpy. let’s do something awesome! let’s make cup cakes,  let’s take a nice picture, let’s sing aloud while walking to the subway or let’s kiss your favorite cafe barista, cuz it’s a new week. potentially an awesome one!,be just a face walking in bushwick. one of the crowd. pretend that choices don’t have consequences. pretend that you have not made any choices. pretend your life doesn’t have color and flavor. pretend you don’t matter.","
