"Any long-boarders here?,I need some kind of better arm guards, any advice?,new longboarder here. i decided on my first deck. bought the earthwing supermodel earlier.,what are the absolute best trucks for $60ish for cruise/freestyle?,btw the supermodel i got is 40"" 9 ply,The supermodel is a decent deck because it can do a little bit of everything, however as far as trucks go you won't feel a difference in Paris, Randal, Bear or Gullwing (All around $50) unless you are going past 30 mph- I would recommend Pairs v2's or Bears just because they are better set for DH or Freeride compared to any other multi purpose 50* truck, however if you are willing to spend $60 on trucks, I would spend $25 extra on Cast Ronins just to be a showoff even though they would not be good for freestyle.,""longboarder"" reporting in,i skate everything from downhill to street decks but i do a lot of freeride mostly. ,Comet Greaseshark and Lifelong Seeker,Been longboarding for a year and skating in general for 4 years.,the supermodel is designed for bears or indy 215s. i ride indy/core hybrids for the longer kingpin to set up larger bushings. Traditional kingpin are sometimes thought to be divey and twitchy. i suggest running a soft duro eliminator style bushing boardside and a harder barrel or cone on the roadside. on mine i run 88a venom SHR elims and sabre 93a barrels. but i weigh 200 lbs.,Yeah buddy! i have this board but with 70mm 82aMetro Motion Freeride Longboard Wheels.,Don't get bears. They are shit. If you're looking for a freestyle truck, paris v2 are the way to go. Don't get v1, because they will bend like its their job,that's original,unless its an arbiter, maven, or drop freeride, originals are shitty and overpriced,Indy 215's are perfect for the Supermodel. They're what t was designed around and they're tons of fun as a beginner truck. You won't be able to handle any serious downhill on them but they kick ass for freeride.,And even in the few cases where they're not shitty and overpriced they're still just overpriced.,downhill freeride,why do i only see kids riding longboards nowadays. you can't shred the same way as you can with a normal deck. i understand the chill factor of it, but the possibilities seem limited. no flip tricks, grinding, or anything like that. i'm at a loss., you can do anything on a longboard that you can on a street deck because there is so much verity. You don't see to much of that because most of us are trying to get away from the trick aspect and trying one thing over and over. But depending on the deck you can do whatever,Landyachtz is where it's at for downhill freeride. They're a bit more expensive than most, but they are bombproof because of that Canadian maple!,You dun fucked up kid,how so?,supermodels are not even close to a freestyle deck dude. You want freestyle pick up something that has a tail, like a regular skateboad or lbl double kick penguin",,"03/30/13(Sat)19:07,03/30/13(Sat)19:43,03/30/13(Sat)19:52,03/30/13(Sat)20:22,03/30/13(Sat)20:32,03/31/13(Sun)01:02,03/31/13(Sun)15:41,03/31/13(Sun)20:08,03/31/13(Sun)20:09,03/31/13(Sun)21:16,03/31/13(Sun)21:17,04/01/13(Mon)11:58,04/01/13(Mon)16:03,04/01/13(Mon)20:48,04/01/13(Mon)21:24,04/01/13(Mon)21:29,04/01/13(Mon)21:29,04/01/13(Mon)21:36,04/01/13(Mon)21:55","Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"

"lets make this 4!,First question:,I can nose slide pretty good, but I always get out fakie and it looks gay. How to BS nose to regs?,How about not.,How about yes.,Question: How do I kickflip more consistently? Just practice more?,How about not you fucking idiot.,sage=/=downvote you stupid cunt,how about you stop being anally devastated?,How about not dicklick.,haha mad babb cos his thread died hhhehehe get fukt kiddie,only bumping because you keep replying.,yeah, just practice, move your foot around until you find something just right,yes. this.,cancer,just try to stay in it and shove yourself forward,Don't know how well you have them, but remembering to keep the pop and flick separate (pop THEN flick) helps me,really? it seems like I do both simultaneously.,anons please. making multiple threads just makes us look as bad as the wrestling people. please, we already had a skate general going on. the reason we're trying to organize this is because apparently they realize this board is a big mess right now. please post over here.,that thread has 200+ replies. It is going to be pruned soon.,cool. i try that,http://youtu.be/F3bMVNvoL7c?t=3m7s,You can kind of see it here,pop-flick-catch-land,Practice every day. Watch videos to help with your foot position. If you get it, do them every day over and over again and eventually they'll become more consistent. It could takes months to get consistency, so be patient and don't give up. ,It's basically an ollie with a crooked foot and a little more follow-through. Pop, drag off to the pocket between the nose and the concave, keep both feet up in the air (as if you just popped an ollie) then try to catch it. You'll get it. ,What helped me was to think ""ollie"" more than ""kickflip"" while I had the proper front foot position.,damn that was a good vid,When nose sliding, keep you shoulders the way they would be coming out regular. Just try it, you should pop out automatically regular.,yeah, I kinda just automanically roll my shoulder back like im doing a 180. I'll think of that,been skating 5 and a half months how should i be by now?,thats a ridiculous question,depends on how much you skate.,What is the bump limit here? 200 seems low,Give more detail,Yeah, the thread went on longer than I predicted. Most threads I start to lose bumps around 200 posts,do all british people hate middle eastern people,Hey guys just wondering I'm getting back into skating after a while and my ollies are crazy on and off been practicing for a few days and sometimes I'll pop ones that go up probably 2 decks and others in which the back wheels dont get off the ground. Also, on my high ollies I almost always land with my toes hanging over the edge or with my front foot on the nose which makes me stumble forward. Any tips thanks guys? Thankfully I still got nocomply 180s (not the landing part but the pop which was a lot harder to learn) and power slides which were always some of my favorites...,got front shuvits,pop shuvits ,ollies ,landed some heelflips ,some kickflips,can sorta manual,i also skate a park once a week,can skate up and down a bowl and turn sometimes,You land on the nose because when you ollie higher you tend to push your front foot forward more. Try sliding your front foot up- a bit slower and stopping it when your foot reaches the bolts. Your front foot should move somewhat in a quarter circle motion.,Sounds about right. You should learn front and back 180's, and try to nollie or switch ollie. Skating a bowl is good too, helps with balance and stuff a lot. You can ollie on and off curbs and stuff comfortably?,why do people ride Mullen so hard when Daewon is better.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uhnh,why switch ollie?,and yeah onto,havent done it off yet,you seen cheese and crackers? Love that vid,skateboarding or longboarding,what other tricks sound i learn to help me get better?,For diversity's sake. Feels better to have a bigger bag of tricks to mess around with rather than only being able to skate a certain way. There are plenty of switch tricks that are easier switch than regular. You don't really understand it at first, but once you get the basic tricks down, you'll find a lot of tricks easier. I have so many tricks I can do way better switch than regular stance.,Because mullen invented everything. You simpl yhave to respect that. I don't know anyone who rides him though. Daewon my fave though,I enjoy both. Somedays I feel like bombing a hill and going 30+mph or somedays I go to a park and drop in. Whatever I feel like doing.,when should i start noticing myself get better enough to try these tricks what should i have down,kickflips and heels?,Hey guys I just got some extra cash, I'm looking at a new pair of shoes. My nikes are pretty beat up after the run they got but I want to try something new, any suggestions and opinions?,Longboarding. Too big of a noob to even ollie lol. I always wanted a board to cruise around with and normal skateboards just don't cut it.,Also here's a general question: I just put new bearings on all my wheels, but my one shitty spinning wheel from before is still a problem now. Still just doesn't wanna spin as well as the rest. Is this a problem with my trucks, my wheel, or maybe did a bad bearing installation?,you have to break in the bearings,want to get into longboarding but dont know where to start,what goods boards can i get ~~$150,skate.,I like Lakai's with shoe goo. DC's are pretty sturdy if you can stand riding them.,Honestly it doesn't matter what order you learn tricks in. All you have to do is have the basic flip, 180 and shove tricks and mess around from there. I tried everything and never cared whether I landed anything, i'm pretty patient though. For kicks and heels just do ollies a lot. The better you have ollies, the better you can do flip tricks. Don't take them too seriously though, a lot of people suck at one or the other for the longest time. Some people can tre perfect and suck at kickflips.,Maybe you should clean the axle,respond please,i still cant fucking ollie i feel like giving up,OG Buzenitz. Cant go wrong with these niggers. Don't even ask why, just go for it. Addidas ftw.,yeah ive been trying to constantly land heelflips and kickflips so fucking annoying cant constantly land them,oh god the jelly is building up. it took me one and a half years to fucking kickflip.,I've had rough patches myself, just keep going at it and you'll get through. Only faggots quit for reasons like ""wahh wahh i cant ________! sum1 halp!! DDD:"" and then they start to longboard or scooter,skateboarding is so empty without tricks and the pleasure of landing a good trick bolts or the feel when you land a kickflip,Choose one.,youtube has trick tips and it in slow mo, there plenty you can do beside ollie. search ""aronl"",Busenitz is never a bad choice.,I couldn't get heelflips good for months, I just did shove it tricks, tried stalls on curbs, flatground mannies and nose mannies, basically every other trick. It just clicked one day after I had been doing ollies up stuff for about a week. I could do a bunch of other tricks at that point.,longboarder detected,Hell, even longboarding isn't really an affective method of transportation. You end up sweating your balls off (depending on where you live I guess) and you risk hurting yourself (and thus making yourself late for wherever you need to be). ,Biking all the way. Longboarding still fucking rocks, though. But for fun, not transport.,Any tips for ollieing higher and more consistently? I heard 180s are a good place to go after ollies but I can never actually pop a proper ollie when I'm focused on rotating and I only end up doing a tiny ollie and rotating 90 deg.,Really snap your back foot down when you pop and bring your legs up when you jump,just twist your shoulders as you ollie man its that simple,ollie like normal, dont even have to think about the turn,ollieing higher has a lot more to do with how far you push your front foot up the board then how hard you snap your back foot, the second part about bringing your legs up more is right though,There's more of a risk when skateboarding, and it depends on your path. Usually I bike to CC, but sometimes I'll walk and carry my skateboard, then coast down the giant hill on the backside of my neighborhood to cut my time in half. Biking's more distance for less energy, but skateboards are more portable,Biking is the fastest and least tiring method of transportation. I like my board though, it's smaller plus doing tricks whenever I want. You can't really walk around at mall or store with a bike in hand.,Just ollie around and get comfortable with them, learn to do them going rolling faster and on and off off curbs. For 180 you just wind, then unwind your shoulders as you ollie, simple as that. At least for front 180s. back ones are harder to learn but more fun when you learn them., skate threads on the front page ,and yet no wrestling fans complain about it,also got fakie shuvs, fakie pop shuvs,I want to try skateboarding and have some fun my senior year of HS during the summer. I have been told to buy a prebuilt complete, but they are all $100 and I'm not sure if I am going to stick with it? Do I just stop being a faggot and fork over the cash, or are there other options that are a bit less (even just 70 or 80 would be better)?,okay /asp/ so i watched this video, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g557,You're not going to get a complete skateboard for under $100. There's just no way.,Yes you can, if you get a shop complete that isn't built with brand parts,This. I got a shop complete for $89. It wasnt the best when you're broke you make with what ya got,Anyway, I say go for it. ,You can try getting a deck off a friend or something and see if you get a feel for it but the only way you're really gonna know if you want to do it is if you take the plunge and buy one,How about all you faggots who have questions figure it out yourselves? For fucks sake its not hard figuring out what you're doing wrong.,sage goes in ALL fields.,Right, so basically go to a skateshop and buy one of their house brand completes? Is the savings mainly out of the hardware or the deck, or both? because I figure I will have to replace the deck eventually anyway. Thanks guys!,This thread is jokes, there's literally no right or wrong way to kickflip, just keep at it and fucking learn it, you're not going to develop a style if you're just copying what everyone else is doing, I love skateboarding but it's become so fucking robotic and Mountain Dew powered it's disgusting.,Inventing so many tricks is fairly easy when theres a clean slate to work from. Words from Mullens mouth himself. Compared to other things he has accomplished in his life, his list of invented tricks pales in comparison.,A clean slate? He redefined skateboarding, Daewon does what he does within the realms of possibility, Mullen on the other hand... Not to Mention Mullen has about 20 years on Daewon he can't even skate anymore, If Mullen was a younger man I think you'd think different.,Mainly on the hardware, in my experience, the wheels aren't the best and the bearings aren't as smooth as something like bones, however these won't be an issue until you decide if you want to take it further. the only issue with a shop complete is that you might need to do some adjustments on it to get it set up how you want it,The best part is that you can replace the parts as needed.,ya.,I had to re-teach myself entirely, mostly the flick though. I found that moving your foot ore towards the center of the board gives you a lot more control, and a better catch,Anyone able to shed some light on FS flips for me? I honestly don't understand how they stay under your feet, board seems to float away from me.,feels bad man,Anyone got anything for BS 180s? I can do back heels, big flips, even back 360s down gaps, but I just can't grasp back regular old back 180s.,For me its just focusing on setting up like an ollie and just turning my shoulders as I pop (I always try to pop those mother fuckers high to have more time to rotate).,Make sure you transfer your weight to your switch backfoot that usually cleans mine up if they're shitty.,Also they're easier switch hahahaha,Yeah, I can already do them switch, nollie, and fakie, just not regular. You say you pop it higher, maybe I should do that. Take it a little slower. I've tried the pivot, but I can't do it backside for some reason. Thanks, I suppose.,Don't pivot them regs, never worked for me. Just pop high full rotation and shift your weight balance,Learn how to ride switch. That way when you do a back 180 you're landing in a stance you're familiar with. Also don't be afraid to wind up your arms.,I'd rather have all them hardflips + nollie BS flip in exchange for FS flip anyday,What do you want instead? More wrestling?,shut up faggot,some people are cunts in every group man, thats how it is,there are cool skaters around,been skating 6 months with not much luck landing tricks ,anyone got any advice/motivation?,keep going,but constantly not landing tricks and skating with people 10 times better than me thinks i wont get better how do i stop this thought?,You get better. Ask them for help and just keep practicing. Skating with people better than you is motivation, become as good as they are. Don't give up, don't ever give up.,this,i dont wanna give up but my mind keeps telling me maybe its a mental block,I've been where you're at, you just need to turn it around and use it as motivation to get better. It'll feel good when you land your shit, you just need to work at it. Skating doesn't come quick, or easy.,how do i keep motivated?,and i will im going to try and skate everyday ,gotta have balls havent grown them yet,Skate videos make good motivation.,They make that shit look fun.,well what can i do too better my skating easy tricks?,dont do the same thing every time you try it,if you keep fucking up and you know youre doing everything you think you should do, try something different, see if it helps,Just land them tricks.,*10000,cubegleamers dot tumblr dot com best skate blog on tumblr!!!,pls no,please recommend others too thx,Got a few tricks filmed today,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlMZ,There's no quick fix to skateboarding, There's no tips or tricks or easy ways out, I've been skateboarding for 11 years, I'm now 21, skateboarding's always come pretty easy to me, but you have to put the effort in, I didn't land my first kickflip till I'd been skating for about year and a half, and I'm not like at a terrible level now. It takes time and practice, just like everything else.,These where popular when i started skating,My biggest issue is getting my feet back over the board. Particularly the front foot. I'm sure once you get it once it makes perfect sense but my legs and feet just feel retarded and don't really know what to do while the board is doing its thing.,Oh shit I remember those.,Skate mini ramps or small parks/banks. You'll get more control of the board. ,Too many kids just stand there fucking up flips aimlessly for a few weeks, then quit. That's not skateboarding. If they could even carve a small bowl, they'd get it.,Where is this beautiful park? Image search gave me nothing.,Shut the fuck up, no one ever like those,fucking D3s,Anyone from FL here? Anyone from 561, 407, or 386?,Edge Skatepark, Redmond, WA USA,It's OC.,I remember wanting a pair of these in 7th grade. Never got them though. I'm glad skate shoes don't look like that anymore. I remember eeing an interview with jerrry hsu and he said he skated a pair of d3's like once and never again.,what shoes?,skateboarding is for teenagers.,Hes basically right.,But yeah, also a troll.,Those shoes look horrible for skating.,pic related in my opinion are the best shoes,Your opinion is meh. These are the best shoes.,That's overboard,i want to learn to longboard,what are some good kinda-cheap longboards to start off with, $150 & below,Has anyone skated Half-Cabs?,Friend has a pair that didn't fit him and I'm wondering if I should bother..,Pic related, this style,Cruiser board is you're only option, because longboardings for faggots,I don't skate mine (I have those),but they're padded just thee right amount and nice and I feel like they'd skate good,I'm wanting to into longboarding.,I was thinking about getting a used board on craigslist so I don't have to drop a ton of dosh on something IDK if I'll get into or not. ,Is buying used generally a bad idea?,Gravis skate pretty well for me.,Gravis, the grey ones are The Filters and the other 2 are Arto's pro model.,go away man,No, since longboarders don't do anything to wear their gear out most of the time. They just sort of ride down the street and then stand around with it waiting for someone to say something or ask them a question.,Oh they also love taking pictures of them.,buy a real skateboard.,I'm a traditional/popsicle skater and I think both cruiser and longboards are neat. A skate nerd should explore experiment with all board shapes.,buy used because like , said, a lot of longboaders really dont ride enough to cause any damage.,longboard=skateboard and vice versa. dont be a kid,I posted the link in a thread a few days ago, people didn't think it was chill so I haven't done it again. I like seeing other people's shoes, and I'm sure that goes for other people too.,who the fuck are you calling a nerd u fucking dork,I agree, I've skated everything I could get my hands on. That said I don't really like the longboard ""culture"" at all. People that just wanna ride whatever whenever are dope though.,Sort of related, I just recently saw Ben Raybourns retro session on that 80s deck, I think it was for the Skateboard mag? Shit was sick.,we got beef?,kids,grinding bowl coping-way easier on a sakateboard,airing bowl coping-way easier on a bike,in redwood city theres a skater that hops in deathtrains with the bikers.. fucking 6foot airs over the hips and all that, fucking nuts,wrong redmond.,Can anyone help me understand how get the flip in an Inward Heelflip?,I know I'm nowhere near being able to do them, I'm still sorting out my Heelflips and Pop Shoves. When they come together I can get some pretty nice ones but consistency is a problem at this point.,What I don't understand is how you can apply the heelflip as the part of the board you flick off of is moving away from you and likely rotated away as well killing the pocket you'd normally be aiming for.,I have trouble with this trick also. This, and it's cousin, hardflips. I get hardflips better though. You'll go on youtube and they'll just say ""HUR DuR ITS JUST A BACK POP SHUV WITH A HEEL ADDED TO IT HURFURFFUR"" and other obvious shit.,flick inward and maybe a bit down, not up or out. I can do every inward but normal, annoying trick.,fuck you guy. I've been skating since November i cant even ollie,what kind of music do you guys listen to while skating?,I find primus is some nice stuff to listen to, but if it's not your cup a tea maybe some ""scratching"" music feels good as well.,Fuck you, I've been on and off for 7 years, and I can't do heelflips or front shove-its.,Sup people,I've been skating for about few weeks right now. I'm 26 years old and never trying skating all my life, so I'm starting from the absolute zero. Feels like a retard trying to skate at such a late age, but I don't give a shit, I ride at night so I don't grab much attention.,I manage to stay to stay on my board almost all the time, I kinda pussy out when I'm entering a downhill because I'm not enterily confident in my ""stoping"" abilities.,Any advices for complete noobs, beside skating and learning from my mistakes ? Until now I'm able to ride and lean to curve the trajectory,you did not apply yourself. its clear,,i've been skating 5 years on and off.,mostly slacking smoking weed, going to parties with the bros.,but every few months that i really apply myself.,i allways find new trick and higher pop.,ride and dont give a fuck.,try tricks, fs, bs, suvs. nollies,everything, have fun,some thrash metal and old THPS soundtracks. Those games got me into skating for life.,All about fun, don't worry about what people think, as cheesy as that sounds.,Just look confident and like you're having fun and you won't look like a chode.,I was skating before THPS came out but they really cemented it as a huge part of my life and were sort of my gateway to the actual culture of it, as young as I was at the time.,I don't care what anyone wants to say about it, those games did great things for skateboarding.,learn to ollie if you can. it changes everything,heelflips:,do an ollie with the front half of your foot hanging off the side of the board.,done.,shove-it:,use your back foot to push the board in the opposite direction of your front foot. too many people try to DRAG the board around with their front foot, the trick is to actually push it forward with your back foot.,Hey anyone here skated with vans stage 4 low? I am thinking about getting a pair. They seem pretty durable, but i am not sure.,i actually switched to DC and loving it.,favorite Vans gotta be Dustin Dollins,Am I really weird for doing my heelflips without my toes hanging off at all? I learned them without any outside input, didn't really have any resources or better skaters around when I was little.,I just kinda, flick out with the front outside of my front foot, my heel never hits anything. When I do them with my heel hitting the pocket they just feel really sloppy and bizarre to me.,I remember being really confused about why they were called HEELflips when I first learned them.,I bought a pair 3 days ago. They are super nice to skate in, especially if you're used to thin shoes. Excellent boardfeel but good heel cushioning. They seem durable so far, i've had plenty of shoes with holes in after three days but these have barely any wear on 'em.,Vans Chukka Lows are nice,I've been skating a secondhand pair of Es's and they're my favorite shoes I've ever had, too bad they're not made anymore.,lakai would be master-race if they didn't rip so god damn fast,currently using the DC mike mo's which are pretty great,this isn't facebook or tumblr.,What are the advantages of having good trucks over standard shitty stock ones? Is it worth getting good trucks? Is it like bearing where it improves over time? What are good brands?,mmmmmmmmm,pls no,good trucks are extremely important. yes trucks and bearings are like wine. you want to stay with them as long as possible. ,the big 3 trucks brands are independent, thunder, and venture. of course there are some other brands that arent so big like ace, krux and theeve which are also good, but obviously there is a reason why the big 3 completely rule the market.,Indies for life.,No exceptions unless you're a Zumiez faggot,Your kingpin and axles wont crack and break off and cause you to eat massive tons of shit,so its only prevalent when doing grinds or and trick involving trucks? I don't think I'll bother then,no how did you even come to that conclusion. but yeah dont bother.,the second poster who replied to me was saying how I would each shit if the kingpin and shit broke off. I guess it only really breaks of when you abuse them with grind and shit,been obsessed with skate culture since i was a kid but never seriously tried doing it myself. lurking all of the threads on this board along with not having shit to do athletically speaking has really motivated me to pick it up. i'm only 18 so i feel like im not too late (i know its naive to think age has anything to do with it) plus i've been talking to a few friends about it and it seems like i can get a board pretty cheaply just to get me going. i just wish this interest would've hit me a little earlier before i got in the middle of engineering school.,I'm 18 as well, I started skating last month. We started too late. When you see a kid who's about 12-16 you would expect them to be shitty to ok level but if you see us 18 to like 21 year olds people will expect us to be doing tre flips with our eyes closed. ,unless you have understanding friends expect them to think you're a child ,don't buy a shit board, that's what I did. Less than a month and my wheels are being chipped out, the bearing were complete shit ( I got to a good speed and slowed down to a halt with 3-4 seconds on level ground) I replaced them with bones read anyway. My deck also snapped within 3 weeks (shitty Chinese maple) I replaced that with a Santa Cruz deck. And the trucks are squeaky as fuck but too poor to replace them.,if you're American you're in luck your skating gear is cheap as fuck. I posted here before gut my new deck was £20 cheaper than it would be in my country.,save up and buy a Santa Cruz complete,just dive in. simple.,yeah im not really concerned with how good i appear to others tho i know what youre saying, i'm just really eager to try this out.,when it comes to footedness tho, reg or goofy, is it just whatever feels more natural? like did you all have to experiment a bit when you first started to see which you preferred?,also do you all know of any more skaters that have a style similar to Gou Miyagi's? i'm not sure if there's a name for it, but just odd and creative street skating.,anyone have any tips for dropping in?,back foot on the tail, front foot on the bolts, lean forward, stomp it, don't be a pussy,cant get any simpler than that.,Go have someone stand behind you and shove you hard, so that you are pushed forward,go do it, now,If you stepped forward with your right foot, you ride regular,Tips for getting comfortable doing Ollie's while rolling?,just do it,Do it slowly. then go faster.,Or probably get more comfortable rolling first,Just fucking do it. Don't lean back.,Put your board on the quarter pipe on the coping with only the tail touching and let go. Watch as the board drops and rolls down. Imagine you;re on top. Just let the board do that and you'll be fine. Just do it. It's freaky but you gotta fucking do it, it gets less scary each time.,I think you got that backwards, if you catch yourself with your right foot you'd ride goofy. ,Also dropping for the first time isn't as easy as people make it out to be. You don't just ""lean forward,"" you have to 100% commit to it and throw your whole body in enough that it stays centered on the board. If you hold back at all, which will be natural if you're scared or unsure, you will definitely fall down. ,Nice thing is once you do it once you're pretty much set for life. I still can't drop in while rolling though, that shit scares the hell out of me.,ride down the side walk and ollie into grass a few times.,I just finished an edit from some clips we got yesterday.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLCO,See if you can find a pair of these Airwalk NTSs. Best skate shoes I've ever owned. Things laste forever with all that rubber on em.,OH GOD NO I WANTED TO FORGET,Vans confirmed for best skate shoes.,Uplifting music mostly. Edward sharpe and the magnetic zeros, band of horses, of monsters and men, tame impala, the lumineers, foster the people to name a few bands. I like skating to all sorts of music except for the overly edgy metal/thrash kind,Holy shit this.,I wanted to skate so badly as a kid but never got far. I'm ungraceful and unathletic as fuck, and I live in a crowded ass city. What do.,don't even bother, if you CBA to buy a board and put time in effort into it you would probably just quit anyway,I was a dumb kid back then.,I'm willing to put effort in, I just don't know where to start.,why are you making it so hard for me not to insult you? Just buy a bloody skateboard and get out there at night time and practise. I'm , and I just felt like picking a new sport and try to do the 10 000 rule with it.,if you couldn't do it as a kid with shitloads of free time, you can't do it as an adult with a worse body and no free time.,305 MUTHAFUKA,me too. id rather not skate with you though.,why? we can go scare some old people,i guess thread is dead,My question is, does it make me sound like a dumdum if I say I want to go S-boarding? Referring to this hobby as s-boarding? I like to S-board?,you sound like a faggot,That hurt my feeling,Guys I have a problem with my ollies there are some days when I can ollie about 6-8 inches like 7/10 tries. Then today I could barely ollie 3 inches 3/10 times. Does this happen to anyone else? Are there just some days which suck or is it because I just bought a wider deck after my deck snapped? Also I just learned fs 180s and no comply 180s where should I go next Ive heard either back 180s or bs pop shove its,there is not set trick list of things to learn, just do whatever you want, you dont have to ask for that. as far as your height, it may just be you getting used to a new board. its not a big deal.,can anyone give me some tips on landing heelflips i land them sometimes but kind of sketchy thanks,red is your toe area. Back foot toe and ball of your foot should be no further than the middle of the tail. Put your feet like in the picture,l pop, kick out.,as much as everyone hates them now they are said to be the best selling skate shoe of all time,Just kick your front foot forward (the way you're facing, not toward the nose) and your back foot back. The board should already be spinning by the time you get the full flick. You should practically be fully extending your legs as the board will be horizontal between them pretty much. I recommend trying them fakie first. They flip easier and you get the general feel. There's very minor tweaking once you do them in regs. Either way, I recommend setting up with only your toes and the edge of your ball on the board and your front foot in the middle of the board with your toes hanging off.,I got them very shortly after getting shuvs and I didn't even have heelflips at all so you don't need to know them to be able to do it.,Agreed man! I ride a 8.25 and I bought a stereo vynal cruiser and I absolutly love it!,This guys has it right!,Jackolantern,buster's mom is a whore,Tim and Eric, guys that skate for Roger fit the bill. Goofy fun stuff, but creative.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpS6,laughed out loud,Is there any trick to the cool looking kick to catch your board?,Dork-tricks the movie.,turn your fucking sholders ,faggot,yeah the trick to doing heelflips is not doing heelflips cause they're fucking gay,kickflips nigga, and flick off the nise,tfw BS and FS noseslide masterrace,FUCK.

Some Material May Not Be Suitable For Children. A PG-rated motion picture should be investigated by parents before they let their younger children attend. The PG rating indicates, in the view of the Rating Board, that parents may consider some material unsuitable for their children, and parents should make that decision. The more mature themes in some PG-rated motion pictures may call for parental guidance. There may be some profanity and some depictions of violence or brief nudity.

"SURFING thread. all surfers (yes the kooks too) get in here. i want this board to last, and i think surfing can make it happen.,post a pic of your home break and tell us what kind of board you ride ,*please do not spot-drop, just tell us your area, unless it's a commonly known wave*,this is from last weekend,bump,no surfers at all?,few more bumps then i'm moving to /out/,Florida east coast here, give me a minute to scrounge up some photos.,yeeew just as i was about to leave too,Ok, I don't have any of me but these are some of my local break.,nice that's what i like to see. you get any during sandy?,unfortunately not, I am up at college right now and missed out on it.,What boards do you normally use up in Ny/NJ?,Down here I mostly use longboards and fish.,ah that sucks, but it's better than what we got. couldn't surf for weeks after because of beach access and water quality.,in the summer i use a small wave quad shortboard (short, thick, and wide) and sometimes a longboard or fishy type funboard if it's really small. when it starts barreling and is 5 feet+ i use a rounded-pin step up.,i would definitely recommend getting a groveler shortboard though, you'll be able to ride it like a high performance board in shitty waves and it gives you break from the longer boards,I love the longer boards though, the main one I use is a 9' 6"" Stewart Longboard with a thurster fin set up. Thing turns good enough that as long as the waves are under 10ft I have no problem riding it. Other than that I have a DaveO 6"" 1"" that is a mix between a fish and a short board (very wide but not thick), a 10' 4"" Hobie, and a 7' 4"" DaveO funshape.,oh well if you like that stuff then stick to it, i can definitely have a ton of fun on boards like that but i can get kind of tired. i love the looseness and maneuverabilityof shortboards so i'm always trying to get on one even if the waves are less than average.,have you been on any trips?,I have found that with short boards it is more about placement than timing, and with long boards its more about timing than placement. For example, when I use my Stewart its all about paddling x distance in x time to be right on top of the wave as it starts to stand up. For short boards I find its more about finding the the right distance in the break, and paddling into the wave when it reaches its peak right before it breaks.,yeah that's true but if you spend enough time on a shortboard you get used to it. when i first started surfing them i couldn't catch anything because i had no idea when to paddle and thought i could just cruise in like on a longer board. usually the better the waves get the easier it is to see where you should be on a shortboard though. and you also need to make sure the board is the right size and volume for you paddling/surfing ability. there are way too many guys out there who can't get into waves cuz they're riding some potato chip kelly slater model. i'm not saying those can't be ridden, but you need to work your way down to a board that small.,Holy flying fuck, a surfing discussion on 4chan?,fuck yeah making it happen. i have buddy that surfs cape cod, nauset i think. he commutes though so you probably wouldn't know him,what shapers?,nauset was my shit 2 summers ago (pic related), but the winter storms fuck with the sandbars so much around here you couldn't find even a tiny line like that anywhere right now. shit's sooo variable.,Log is a Stewart, fish is a Canyon. Don't know the shapers.,My friend has a custom by Sean Vecchione of Vec Surfboards. He's a pretty cool local shaper and I surf with him occasionally.,never heard of him, i'm assuming he's local where you are. do you surf at all in the winter?,yeah NJ has been like that recently especially with all of the fucking beach replenishments going on. sandy was a curse but also a gift for us on the barrier islands, because we got a bunch of old spots back. usually the winter storms and hurricanes make the sand better here, i wonder why it's different up where you are. you guys have reef breaks and points right next door though right? not really anything like that here, just the good old jetties.,Yea, Vec's a local guy who runs a little shop in town but he's pretty well known up around here.,Just started surfing in the cold this year. Went out on wednesday actually. It's decent for a quick fix if the waves are good but I really fucking hate the cold.,Beach breaks are it on the cape. There's a shitty point or two in the Rye, NH area but not much else. Have you got some secret spots I don't know about?,that's great, you just have to get used to it. when i started it sucked, but it gets easier with every session. i don't have a ton of money to spend on gear so i use a 4/3 all year and that can get really shitty. either way it's worth it because the waves in the summer don't even compare to the winter. hopefully we get something again soon, looks like maybe tomorrow and then next week if the wind is good.,and nah i've only been surfing up there once my friend just hypes it up to me all the time. i've heard new hampshire has some really amazing points though you just need to do a lot of driving and looking. again, i've only heard that from other people so i don't know any specifics,Yep, same, all I could get was a 4/3 but it's a nice ripcurl flashbomb so it's warm enough for an hour or two. Same deal up here with winter waves, though. Sooo much better when they decide to show.,I only surf up in NH on occasion so I don't know too many breaks other than the main ones. I'll have to do some exploring next time.,Posted this last night but pic related is me at a spot I hold dear. It's not my home break but my family owns property there. It's somewhere in Southern/Central California. This is from about a month ago, we got some unreal surf. It was freezing cold though, especially coming from Hawaii where I live now. This was a smaller day when my friend's dad was filming.,Another,Part deux. ,A lot of East Coasters posting here. East Coast has been firing this year huh? I'm originally from North Carolina so it pains me to see all the good waves you guys are getting this winter. But I live in Hawaii so it eases the pain., oops forgot pic,Gonna dump some random shit. I have tons.,Julian Wilson at some random wedge in Costa.,Dusty's style is unreal,awesome pictures. yeah this winter has been ridiculous, so many great days. that's probably the norm where you are though haha it just seems so great this season cuz we're used to shit.,what island do you live on? my friends uncle lives right outside of diamond head. i've been trying to make a trip over there,What is the water temp in Cape Cod this time of year?,I live on Oahu, pretty close to Diamond Head actually.,North Shore is still firing this time of year and a lot of the people are gone. I try to make it up as much as possible.,This spot is really localized and everybody there is pretty damn protective. Luckily we got this session mostly to ourselves because it was a smaller day. Towards the end of our session a couple of steely eyed older guys paddled out. They couldn't say shit since we were out first, but they wanted to.,We slept in a cave on this trip and did a ton of hiking and exploring. It's an unreal area.,i probably won't be able to get off until april though are there still any waves then?,and are you living in hawaii for the waves or did something else bring you there?,Looking out of the greatest place on earth.,yeah April is interesting because you can catch North or South shore. It's really a transition month. North shore usually still has some swell in early April though. How experienced are you? North Shore is not for the uninitiated.,where was that?,Dane Reynolds at a spot I used to surf frequently. I lived in the Santa Barbara area for about 5 years and while it doesn't get incredibly consistent waves, it has such a unique vibe and some really good waves when it turns on. There are lots of hidden gems as well.,Still below 45. Fucking blows,Hollister area.,This is me at a semi-secret Caribbean spot a couple years back. The place gets unreal but it also has a lot of wind. Another downside is there is exactly jack shit to do when there are no waves. It's a pretty desolate place. But when I lived on the East Coast it was a great little escape to go surf down there for a week or so when a swell lined up with good wind conditions.,Pic related, same island. Big set feathering on the outside section at this big offshore right. This place is literally in the middle of the fucking ocean. Land is just a thin strip when viewed from the lineup. You need a boat to access this wave. Really fun, long, down the line rippable yet powerful wave. That's me just waiting for a set.,that picture is sick,i'm only 18 but i've experienced my share of large surf. i was in puerto rico 2 years ago and we got a 12-15 foot swell. i surf year round in NJ and everyone knows how heavy a beachbreak can get in the dead of winter. i'm more freaked out about the locals, are they really as bad as people say they are?,Sequence from a small little day at another reef pass on the island. You need a boat to get to this spot as well. Really fun wave. Super high performance and fast. I don't think this place ever gets dangerous. There's a really hollow Teahupo'o style left across the channel that is scary and shallow as fuck. Lots of sharp reef and current.,shit, you get around. what's your job? judging by the places you've lived and these trips you're talking about i'd guess it was something to do with the industry. thanks for posting this stuff by the way, awesome and kind of weird to see this on 4chan,Yes I do know how heavy East Coast beachbreak can get! Fucking right man. I'm from North Carolina and we get some pounding swells sometimes, especially up in the OBX. ,You will probably be fine on the north shore. Show respect, keep your head down, and understand the rules of the lineup. And obviously don't paddle out at Pipe and expect to get waves.,Some good spots for beginners are Chuns, Haleiwa, Pu'ena Point, Rocky's when it's smallish, Val's/Kammieland, etc. There is a lot to be explored out at the Mokuleia area as well, wind permitting. It can get heavy there when its big but there are a lot of spots and minimal people.,No, just that my dad and uncle have been surfing since the '60's and they love it and are passionate about it. They own a lot of property around the country in wave rich areas and every time I go on a trip with my dad it's a surf trip so it's a pretty rad setup. He still rips but recently got neck surgery so he's out of the water for a while...,I'm out here in Hawaii working and going to school.,Pic is a shot I took of my roommate at Ke'Iki shorebreak on the North Shore.,oh do you go to UH? i'm looking at colleges now and that's one of my main choices. that friend's uncle went there and after living in jersey for quite a while he uprooted his entire family and just went back last year. i'd like to go over there and look at the college and surf with him, cuz he said he'd set me up if i went.,Any of you guys surf alone?,I really want to learn to surf and I have a couple of boards but none of my ""friends"" like to swim, surf, or go to the beach. fucking sucks. I have no experience so I'll look like a retard and probably get in the way of other surfers. I guess I shouldn't let that stop me, right?,Yes I go to UH. Im at the Shidler College of Business and it's actually a pretty good school considering it's in Hawaii. You should at least come out and check it out. Hawaii is a unique place especially if you surf.,Yes I prefer surfing alone sometimes. Solo sessions are where I surf the best and improve the most because I'm focused on what I'm doing right and wrong and focused on improvement. When I'm out with friends I bullshit and talk story and don't pay attention. Also they occasionally jack my waves. Assholes.,Pic is Nias.,don't let it stop you but also don't let it get you into trouble. where do you live? try to find a place that isn't too crowded, or go down a few beaches from where everyone else is (assuming it's safe and there are still waves). since you don't really have many resources i would start on internet forums like swellinfo.com ,another good way to get advice on where to surf, what board to use, etc. is to go into a surf shop, buy something small, and then mention that you're new to surfing or the area even. they might think you're a kook but at least you'll have gained some knowledge. lessons might also help because depending on how old you are surfing is hard at first. learning to paddle into waves is by far the most difficult part for beginners, and that's usually where they end up pissing off other people.,at crowded spots there's almost always a pretty strict system of priority, but it's the same everywhere so a lesson or a surf with someone more experienced will go a long way.,i only have 1 or 2 friends that actually surf so i'm alone most of the time, but if you're a beginner you should definitely start with someone,Wow that pic. What's the story behind this? It's absolutely firing, how fucking stupid do you ahve to be to get a boat anywhere close to that lol.,Where are you from?,pic related, punting in Indo.,yeah i'd love to go to school there and will definitely try to check it out this year. what were your grades like going in? also how safe is it where you spend most of your time? i've heard mixed feelings and don't want to be living anywhere too sketchy,not sure i found it on magicseaweed, i think it's indo though probably mentawais. and i'm from new jersey,So, as a guy that has never surfed before, what would be a good starting point? I have at my disposal:,80 dollars,water,Ho sup you fuckahs?,I'm in Cali right now i wanna try surfing, but brah I have a feeling im gonna suck haha,that depends on what state you live in,Forgot my name on this post but that's me.,And also,,is right in the regard that somebody more experienced will really help you get up to speed. I was speaking from the perspective of having all the fundamentals and basics down and just freesurfing by yourself. But yeah learning would benefit greatly by someone more experienced.,Pic is my buddy John snapping on a small day in Mexico.,Ya that's def Lances Right in the Mentawais. That's gnar.,Jersey has been absolutely firing this winter. My friend lives in NY and has been scoring.,Baja, on Mexico,Thanks, I'm 19 and live in Hilo on the Bigisland.,surfing spots are limited- either Honoli'i or pohiki (unless I drive pretty far) both of which are usually pretty crowded but I'm sure I could find a spot. I'm also white, so It's kinda easy to piss some people off for no reason. we have 2 boards here, a larger one and a smaller one. both have one fin too. any idea which one I should start with? I'm pretty good at body boarding and a decent swimmer.,Get a boogie board to figure out how waves work. It's fun as hell too. Other than that $80 won't get you too far. ,What state you live in? This time of year you'll be freezing without a wetsuit in everywhere except, like, Miami or South Padre Island, Texas. Lol.,My advice is wait til the summer and try boogie boarding. Low budget, fun, get to see if you even like waves and the ocean, etc.,It's fairly true but there are a ton of beginner spots. ,But yeah honestly we could use much less people in the water so don't even try.,What part of Baja?,The part with the guns and the killings. ,The northernmost part, tijuana.,North Baja gets some unreal waves. You'll just need to travel, and you'll need a wetsuit. All the other advice applies as well.,that's pretty much right, but there will always be people like me willing to help you just have to find them,Mikeyboiy might know more there because I don't know anything about Big Island. as for which board to use, definitely start with the bigger one. do you know how old they are or their lengths? because if they're longboards then the single fin is fine, but i don't know how easy it would be to learn on a retro single fin board. being good at swimming and body boarding is a definite plus, and will help you with the hardest part (getting into waves).,$80 might be able to get you an okay board to learn on, it's going to be a piece of shit though. don't worry about a wetsuit if you're in baja, although i don't know if it gets cold there at some point. also a boogie board might be a good idea like he said because it will help you learn the basics of paddling and waveriding and they're cheap,North Baja gets really cold this time of year.,fuck is that the offshore spot you posted before?,Being an inexperienced white boy learning to surf on the Big Island is a sticky situation. Big Island doesn't exactly cater to haoles.,If you're familiar with bodyboarding you should know a few rules of the lineup and how to deal with angry mokes and whatnot, so the same concepts apply to surfing.,You should start with the biggest board for stability and paddling power.,But to continue this, when you get down to the essence of it:,The fact that you know it's possible to piss people off easily is honestly the biggest hurdle. ,The people who get themselves in the biggest trouble are the complete scrubs who just think surfing is a happy go lucky sport with beach boys music and smiling friendly people. ,Purely based on the fact that you understand that localism and pecking order and rules of the lineup exist, I think you should be fine. Act accordingly, stay out of people's way, and try to learn at mellow beginners spots.,how often do you get to surf in the winter living on the south shore? are there waves nearby or do you have to drive north to surf? and i can't imagine classes let you do that very frequently,No waves on the South Shore in the winter. You have to go North.,East Side can get good sometimes, same with West Side but West is sketchy as fuck.,Pic is Okinawa on a cyclone swell. Looks sick as fuck but this spot is probably flat 360 days of the year. Look up okinawa on a map lol.,To clarify, this is on the West side of Okinawa. This swell came from the direction of China. I'm sure the east coast gets fairly consistent waves.,I'm from the Jersey Shore, all the kids who surf in my area make me jealous because we live on the fucking water, and they've found a way to waste time efficiently. Anyway, I'm going to Peru this summer with my Dad, so I'm thinking of taking lessons there (which my Dad says are actually useful). I doubt I can learn how to surf in a lesson haha, but I want to see what the hell surfing is all about since the subculture around it is so giant near me...,Anyway, I guess this is unrelated to the thread, but I see NJ popping up a lot in here so just thought that was cool, haha.,so then going to school in hawaii would probably provide less waves than somewhere like california right? assuming the drive is about 45 minutes are you still able to go a few days a week?,I take classes 3 days a week, so 4 of my days are free to surf essentially.,What part of California are you talking about?,shit tons of NJ guys on here. ,surfing isn't really about productivity, but it's also not a waste of time. while there are obvious immediate benefits like the exercise, most of it is purely mental or spiritual. there is literally NOTHING, not even sex that can you give you the same feeling as surfing. now annoying little scumbag kids usually aren't great at surfing and might be doing it to look cool, so they aren't really reaping the full potential the sport has to offer. but in the end, it just comes down to an obsession for riding waves, and it sounds corny as fuck, but it's all true.,anywhere really. i'm just at the point where i need to decide on a college that is going to give me waves as well as an acceptable education even though i have no idea what i want to do. are you currently studying for an undergraduate?,Hey surfbros. I wanted to get into surfing, but ave no idea where to start. Any help or advice you can give me?,Haha, I'm a bit high, sorry... I didn't mean to say ""waste of time"" in a derogatory manner, I meant it more as in how a hobby can kind of consume a lot of your time and sort of be the thing you choose to waste your time doing... ,I mean there's sports like hockey and football and whatnot, but then /asp/orts like skating, surfing, whatever. I just dabble in more alternative sports, but still find myself succumbing to weed to be the thing I choose to waste my time (mainly because I don't have the skills/dedication to keep up with my activity of the month, haha).,Anyway, pic from NJ the day before Sandy...,I think it depends on the area quite a bit. For example, there are a few surf spots where I live. There is Spanish House, Monster Hole, Sebastien Inlet, and Fort Pierce Inlet. The first two you wouldn't know about unless you have been surfing for a while, while the other two are tourist spots. Though depending on what break you are going for you can go from grommets learning to surf to a fierce locals. At Fort Pierce you will find a overall nicer crowd but when the waves kick up it gets very competitive with locals. Then at Sebastien if your not a regular your pretty much not welcome near the pier. ,So my suggestion is look around and find a nice spot thats not to crowded, with a smaller break. Often you will find people a lot more laid back at places like this.,alright guys it's 1 am here in jersey and it looks like there are going to be waves in the morning so i'm out for tonight. this thread may last until tomorrow and if not i'll just make another one. great talking to everyone,Read the rest of the thread kook. Theres plenty of advice.,Sebastian Inlet isn't exactly a tourist spot. The locals there are fairly protective, not to mention the militant fisherman.,So can I get a crash course on surfing? I want to start, I live in San Diego btw, I guess I shouldn't have a problem finding 'spots', r-right?,And surfing is not for those who have problems dedicating to something. It is a sport with one of the steepest learning curves. As in, you will suck ass for at least a year, possibly 2. And you will hate a lot about it in the beginning like getting pounded, water up your nose, board hitting you in the face, going over the falls, getting yelled at for getting in people's way, cutting yourself with your fins, etc. But once you get past that stage and begin to get good it is incredibly rewarding.,see,The learning curve is INCREDIBLY steep. Most people who start quit within a month or so because the learning process is so slow and daunting. There is so fucking much to learn, from reading conditions, to reading waves, to paddling properly, duckdiving, learning where to sit, etc, etc etc. And that doesn't even take into account actually standing up on the wave without eating shit or going over the falls.,But the best course of action is to buy a decent wetsuit ( can find great ones for under $200 brand new nowadays because wetsuit technology is so god damn advanced now that even the entry level models destroy anything that was out even just 10-15 years ago) and buy like, a soft-top board and just get out there. Learn how to pop up on your feet while still on the beach, and then learn to paddle. The list of things you need to learn is honestly very long but there should be some decent resources out there for a complete beginner. Check youtube and the like for the absolute basics.,Gonna continue image dump with The King himself.,Well I used to skate regularly for 5 years, did grinds, stairs gaps all that good stuff. I've tried snowboarding like every other winter and I've been decent at it. I guess I've got pretty good balance and a feel for boards.,I've never tried anything in the water though, I'm pretty sure it will be different. I'm a quick learner too, I hope I can pick it up quickly, thing is I don't know anyone that surfs so that I can get taught the learning ropes of what and what not to do y'know?,And well, lets be honest, no one likes newbies.,Pipe in the 60's. I can't even imagine.,Ok that's good, it's a start. That will help you a lot but reading water conditions and waves is an art in itself. Just get out there with a cheap soft-top and give it a try.,Do you know anything about the San Diego surfing scene though?,Oh and skateboarding and snowboarding, while similar, really feel nothing like surfing. Like, some of the concepts are alike but there is really no other sport that compares to surfing in terms of mechanics. You are generating your own speed on a moving wall of water, on equipment that feels worlds different than skateboarding and snowboarding. I do all three extensively and surfing is just incomparable in many aspects.,Yep. It's a pretty great place to learn, possibly one of the best in all of California. There are tons of accessible spots for beginners.,Got no pic, but my home break is canoes (dropping name cause it's not exactly a secret spot). I've been a few other places, but usually with people who are born an' raised locals (mainland invader here),Hoping to eventually get good enough to handle larger waves but for now I pretty much ride a funboard (around 8ft) on loan from a friend till I get the money and space to store my own board.,As someone who's spent a lot of time snowboarding I find it strange how aggro surfers can be. I mean shit, after hearing about the culture and seeing stuff like step into liquid I figured it'd be a lot more chill than it is. I guess it's cause everyone's waiting for the sets to roll in and there's no guarantees? Whereas snowboarding the mountains not exactly going anywhere. Whatever, it's been about a year and I've personally only gotten the occasional angry remark, but I've seen some shit go down at other spots. It's why I stick to canoes.... it's location and riders make it hard for people to be dicks.,D-does skimboarding go here?,Surfing is aggro because every wave is a resource and it invokes primal territorial and resource based aggression, same as food or women to our homosapien brain. Since you are sitting out there waiting for one to come in, the best waves of the set are coveted and the alpha males think they have claim to it and the more experienced people think they have claim to it. So everybody is jockeying for position and hoping to be the one to get the next wave coming in. That's my opinion anyway.,But yeah it is different from skateboarding and snowboarding in that regard, in that you are not sitting there waiting for a resource among people that only 1 person will get to ride per wave, and only 3 or 4 will get a wave in that set.,no.,Great way to bring newbs into the sport.,And yea I hear you about canoes. When I feel like I'm no longer a scrub I'll start branching out, for now I'd rather not deal with the drama until I'm confident in my abilities. There's another spot I like on the south shore that's usually pretty quiet and has good waves, just takes a while to get too because it's a bit from shore and you gotta maneuver around all the coral.,Is that outside of Waikiki? I live out East, in Hawaii Kai area.,It's out of waikiki but near it, and yea to the east.,Where? Toes? Wailupe? Secrets? Tuna Bowls?,Describe the area. chances are I know the spot.,Well to be honest, for most surfers and particularly the aggro ones, keeping people out of surfing is kind of the goal. Bringing newbs into the sport is seen as a negative thing. I tend to fall along this line of thinking as well. I've been surfing for 15 years and the explosion of the surfing population has been detrimental to say the least.,http://www.wannasurf.com/spot/Centr,Salsipuedes. El mejor ola en Baja cuando las olas se venga.,Lo siento mi Espanol es perezoso ahora.,CJ,I have the pleasure of this beautiful spot. Thursday had the best surf of my life!,Goldcoast?,Is that you,Have you ever been mugged, carjacked in Baja? Escondido Ca native here. Me and a couple friends were planning on driving all the way down to los Cabos, and wanted to take a couple board with me. Only been surfing for about a year and a half.,Any advice?,ausfag here with a custom goddard board.,fucking don't have the specs, because i've had it 2 weeks and my dropkick best mate won't give it back because he's having too much fun with it.,That be Gold Coast, overcrowded arena of the gods,Lennox Head here. I don't often bother venturing an hour North to contend with the Goldy circus out in the water. Epic waves, but the crowds are so brutal. Guess it's not so bad when it's challenging as it at least keeps some of the lesser skilled at bay.,that looks like north jetty,Yeah the crowds outweigh the benefits of surfing at snapper, usually Duranbah is best to go to because there are more waves spread out so not all going for the same wave,I usually head south for the quieter spots in between Cabarita and Byron.,So in an ideal world the surfing population would die out every generation or so? The surfing population has been ""exploding"" since the 60s.,Ricebowl / Tonggs,Not really. It exploded in the '60s and subsequently tapered off in the mid '70s through the '80s. When the Kelly Slater / Momentum generation came into the spotlight in the early '90s surfing really saw a second explosion that has been fairly steady ever since.,I just think keeping the wrong people out is good for the sport and I believe in passing the torch to the people who really do it for the right reasons.,Yep I know ricebowls and tonggs. We should surf some time. You ever get around to the other side of Diamond Head?,Because it is,glad to see the thread is still going. i made my name NJ for now so we at least know who we're talking to.,venice?,i've surfed in captiva before, god i love the gulf when there are waves. it was really small when i was there and i didn't have a board so i had to rent a Bic from some kooky tourist shop but i had a blast.,these are some pics of one of my usual breaks from last spring. sorry for the shitty quality i took them with a cell phone,is that the right?,Nah it's the north jetty in Fort Pierce Florida. Its kinda a cool spot, there are multiple sandbars scattered north of the jetty and depending on the conditions different breaks will pop up. My favorite one is just to the right of the no surf zone when we have a storm to the north east. Perfect longboard waves, start off as a large swell well before anything else, and when they start to break you have already been on the wave for a good 50 ft or so.,sounds smooth as fuck. i've actually never surfed on the east coast of florida, but i plan on making a road trip along the east coast some point soon so i'll probably end up surfing there a bunch.,this is a picture i took in long island NY on March 9th. was probably the nicest day all winter and the waves were just unbelievable all day.,If you do visit the east coast check out Monster Hole if you aren't afraid of sharks.,another one from 3/9,yeah i've heard crazy things about that spot (good and bad). i've also heard it's difficult to access?,Compared to the rest of Florida yes due to it being about a 20 minute paddle if you jump in, or you could do what I did and get a friend with a boat.,Surfing on 4chan? Weird.,Anyone else from Britain, specifically Cornwall?,Local spot is Gwithian, absolutely terrible wave most of the time but has it's days. Usually packed with 2-300 people,Looks super fun,South Los Angeles, Beach break, board is shaped by Proctor, da monster is the model. ,haven't been in the water in a while tore my rotator cuff playing hockey.,View from the local surf cam at my beach a few weeks back.,I always got the impression that England water was cold as FUCK year round but I just checked it and it's only 48. Yeah thats cold and all, but I just got back from central california , , , , where it was 52 and I was fine in just a 4/3, boots and gloves.,That makes me want to visit UK to surf. I've seen Scotland firing before when I was on a train and I heard it gets really good up there.,I've surfed in Ireland in Sept and early October. 4/3 and booties are all you need. A hood is nice some days but that is more to keep the wind out of your ears than anything else.,I do not surf, but I have some friends who do. If you ever come to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, you should definitely check out the Itacoatiara beach. Its about 30~40 min by car. This beach altough there are more people who bodyboard, is nice for surfing too.,If you're interested you can check this video on youtube (with english subtitles),[spoiler]http://www.youtube.com/wat,It gets pretty chilly from November to March, starting to get better now. In winter you need AT LEAST a 4/3 and boots and hood. Spring to Autumn you can get by in a 4/3 and wear a summer suit on the warm summer days.,It's definitely not as bad as a lot of people think it is but there's big problems with overcrowding whenever the surf gets half decent., I've done a couple of trips to Scotland, it gets amazing up there and as long as you can handle the cold you'll get some pretty empty waves as well,Fucking just got denied from UCSB literally 5 minutes ago. Cocksuckers.,Accepted to UCSC though, so hopefully there will be some waves in my collegiate future. Cold is a non-issue coming from MA,I'm a banana slug alumni, Best 4 years of surfing in my entire life. If you got any questions about Santa Cruz throw them out. ,You will love the lane.,Wow man that sucks.,Ever think about SBCC? They have a direct program into UCSB. If you go there for 1 year and do well in classes, or sometimes even just 1 semester, you can get nudged right into UCSB. Just a thought. Oh and SBCC is the #1 community college in America too.,Pic related, one of the most amazing fucking waves in the SB area.,I'm going to taghazout for 6 days this sunday, what suit am I gonna need? I'm a hardened northwalian, and don't get cold easily (was in 'straya a couple of years back and everyone was in full 3/2's, I was in boardies and was fine).,would rather not wear a suit if I don't have to,You will probably be fine in a decent 3/2. Get a good one though. It'll last you for years if properly taken care of. Wetsuits these days are so fucking good that you can surf in water temperatures that used to require a 4/3.,If you're a resilient cunt show those pussy maroc cunts who's the boss and paddle out nakey.,I surf torrance/elporto all the time brah.,Board Is by Don K.,pic related, spot is Haggertys. The cliff just south of torrance/burnout makes for a nice break because of the underwater canyon that funnels friendly angled swells exclusively to elporto and torrance, drives up the floor to be higher there. its nice!,my pic is Torrance, I usually surf torrance/topaz/burnout I live a block up from topaz,Caribbean,UCSC is another one i'm considering. not sure how easy it will be for me to get in though because i'd be coming from new jersey. it's also expensive as fuck so i was considering doing this , until i became a resident , i think UCSB would be a little out of my league unfortunately. right now however hawaii is looking the best in terms of grades and whatnot. i just need to be able to take a look sometime soon.,i love this picture and the article about that spot. definitely try to find it if you haven't read it,Visited Rincon when I was in SB looking at the school. It sucks to have to let it go but honestly, all I'm looking to get out of going to school in Cali is consistent waves I can progress on. I feel like New England just plateaus my surfing sooo hard because I can barely actually surf.,Fuck yeah dude, don't know if you're still in this thread, but how easy is it to get from campus to a decent break? Am I gonna have to find someone with a car or what?,I read up a bit on SBCC and drove through campus, and I'm still contemplating a few other schools before I accept anything. As of right now it looks like it'd make more sense to go to UCSC. Maybe I'll transfer but probably not. SC isn't a terrible school, and I just wanna fucking surf.,Bells Beach mother truckers live along the great ocean road,I've surfed about four times and I'm comfortable standing up and turning (on a 8' longboard). I'm also good in other board sports like bodyboarding and skateboarding. I am looking to get my first board soon, and I've heard that fish boards allow you to catch waves easily, without sacrificing the ability to move. I'm a pretty small kid (5'0 and 100 pounds) and I usually surf Southern California.,Pic unrelated,any of you ausfags know anything about bond university or other colleges on/near the gold coast? i'm obsessed and would love to live in australia for a while but i dont know how difficult it would be to attend coming from the US and obviously there aren't too many people here that would know alot about that,That's not Rincon. It's a much, much, much better wave than Rincon. Rincon is overrated and overcrowded.,Bond is extremely overpriced and most of their degrees are seen as inferior to other universities.,Griffith is fairly popular and has a large student base, some would say it's bad but those are just freaks from UQ in Brisbane.,Southern Cross is the special olympics of universities, anyone can get into a course there, though it's right near some of the best beaches on the coast and is on the southern end of the coast whereas the other unis are on the north end which have overpopulated beaches with terrible surf.,There's also one or two other universities no one has ever heard of and I don't really remember the names of.,French bodyboarder reporting in.,I'm on the Atlantic coast in Vendée and the past few days have been awful... too much wind, not enough swell... I hope it'll get better soon.,I'm not in the best area to surf but we still have some good breaks not that far, pic related.,tunas..such a fun wave.,my home break firing, not a pic of me.,ride a 6'0 fish, deep swallow glassed on twin fin. completely black with pink pin lines, fiberglass and resin,real clark foam blank. fuck epoxy.,forgot pic,WHERE ARE ALL THE SURFERS?!?!?!,I've not been out past diamond head to surf, been out there for hiking (Kuliou'ou is a sick way to start a day) and to go to sandys to hang out. That's about it. I got 19 creds at school this semester and I work, so I don't get to go out very much which is why I don't have my own board and why I'm still newb level. If you wanna go sometime despite all that I'd be down, could start an anon crew.,the next south swell all anons should meet up and surf, we can even do waikiki for the less experienced till they get better.,It's supposed to be good the next 2 days.,I'm down.,Califag here. Never tried surfing, but it's always looked interesting and maybe something to try this summer. I live in SoCal, but the only real surf spot I known of is Rincon up near Santa Barbara. Do you guys have any pointers or anything for a prospective beginner?,where is socal? there are a lot of good breaks for learning,Well, I live in the Valley, but I'm about an hour's drive from Malibu taking the canyons. Like I said before, surfing looks pretty interesting and I always pass by surf shops either driving around town or heading out to the coast so I might pick up the hobby this summer if I've got nothing else to do. Rincon looks really pretty and quiet whenever I go out up there, but I'm thinking it will get crowded once summer rolls along.,It's not quite a ""pick up the hobby if you're bored"" sort of thing, but good luck.,There are a lot more spots closer to you than Rincon, I guarantee it. Rincon isn't exactly a beginner wave either.,South Africa, reporting in. Local spot is Elands Bay - pic related. Gets hella crowded though. Oh and I'm goofy so the left suits me just fine :-D,San Diego says what up. ,Here's a tip: shlongboards. Just like surfing, except you have to be a hermit or a retard to be unable to find a spot to ride it.,I wouldn't think so but, well, I don't really know anywhere else. I was thinking of just stopping in one of the local surf shops and just asking around about good beginner spots and maybe some tips.,You're gonna need to enlighten me as to what the heck that is.,different anon but here's another tip, remove two letters to decipher to super hardcore code.,Goolwa in Australia here.,Thought I'd get back into surfing recently, haven't surfed in like 10 years? Maybe more.,Got the old board out (don't even know what it is, old single fin), drove down to the beach and..... Nothing,Like barely a wave full stop. ,There's always tomorrow I guess.,agreed bro.,im from goldy/ tweed, and i don't even bother with snapper anymore, just a fucking shitfight. D'bah is usually pretty packed, but if you're not a kook, you'll atleast get some fun waves.,Kingscliff and fingal are decent too,Centralamerifag reporting in with my local break (on a small day),Don't have any shots on me unfortunately.,Literally the board I learned on, the first one and only one I've owned. I'm pretty glad it's lasted so long., What , said is pretty spot on, although a little exaggerated. Bond is a good uni, just way too expensive, if you don't enjoy the company of rich brats, steer clear.,If you're just looking to surf and chill and don't give two shits about education, then SCU is for you. its not a bad uni, but definitely nothing special. I've lived southern goldy all my life, it's a lot less exciting than north, but wayyy better beaches.,North East droppin in.,Last time i was at gwith there was only 4 other people but was cross slop.,El Salvador?,thanks for info, good to know the colleges' reputations. so are the north and south sort of divided by coolangatta? would the popular beaches like kirra and snapper be considered north?,and it's not that i don't care about education at all, i'm just sort of lazy so my grades are just average. would a degree from griffith look better than bond? and would southern cross be a total joke or can i at least get a decent job with a degree from there? sorry for these stupid questions, i just have no other way of finding out about this stuff,Kirra and Snapper are considered south, Coolangatta is actually to the south of Kirra. If you went to Griffith it'd be about a 45 minute drive up on a good day as well which is something you need to consider. Job wise I'm not really too sure, I know a guy who got his master's in education at southern cross and now works at a private school doing higher level stuff so yeah.,wait isnt griffith north of them? if they're within a fairly short drive of a decent break i'd be okay but if i have to drive 45 minutes to surf everyday that would be a bit much,SoCal fag reporting in,I live right by The Wedge,feels good man,Griffith is north. Coolangatta is south, it's the last town/suburb before New South Wales. Theres plenty more surf spots as you head further into NSW too. ,Depending on what degree you study decides whether it'l look better from bond or griffith. What are you gonna study?,the...the jettys? shit i never knew anyone from around here went on 4chan,I can't even believe there are people on 4chan who actually surf, holy shit. I don't think I know anyone who surfs irl who even uses the internet. Is it because this is really incredible or is it because I've been on 4chan way too long?,if any of you people surf the cliffs in SD on a regular basis holy shit i might die,Also, hilarious that this board ends up with the name /asp/ even though it's probably the least aspie of the bunch.,fuck that, we're the w/asp/s,might even get a w/asp/ sticker for my board if this place sticks,lol holy shit 4chan could sponsor 'CT surfers.,wud b laff,they could have black and yellow striped team suits/boardies,fuck i was i hoping someone would recognize it. i usually surf on the other side because i drive in from north. is that your spot?,i'm not entirely sure what i want to do yet. do you know what the big degrees are there? independent of those schools i was originally thinking meteorology, political science stuff (international relations), or maybe law? as you can see i honestly have no idea and i'm definitely open to any others. my strongest subjects are generally history and english although i hate writing,i was personally hoping moot is a closet surfer and was naming us after the tour,classic filename. i really hope they don't get rid of this board, does anyone know the likelihood that will happen?,Well, of the 3 new boards, this one is the slowest. But it has been fairly popular so far thanks partially to the wrestling fags I guess. But I feel like if communities grow here moot will let it stay. Hell, it's a lot more civil and refreshing than say, /r9k/, for example, and he brought that shithole back. I think this board is actually faster than some of the boards on this site.

It's where the cold water classic is held. Nice part about steamers is it's almost never blown out and it jacks up off the cliff when it smaller so even when everywhere else is flat you get chest high surf there. If you don't have a car I'd at least find a bike. You could walk it but it's about 2 miles from the base of campus to the water. ,SC has one of the prettiest campuses as well up in the redwoods, get used to living with super liberal hippies though.,Yea, I've been to steamers once before. Pumped on that spot being so close.,As far as cars on campus go, I'm from across the country but I'll probably drive out over the summer to get most of my shit over. Is it easy to have a car as a freshman? Is parking stupid expensive? Should I rely on making friends to drive me around or what?

That'd probably be during winter though, I'd be undercooled in no time even with a wetsuit on.

Tend to stick on the other side of the jetty on Croatan side or go up to like 79th steet area.,yep i know that spot. don't know why everyone insists on sitting right up against eachother on that jetty when the wave is just mediocre,came here to find this thread, stoked. floridafag here recently relocated to socal.,here's a pic of the break I walk to every day.,landed my first re-entry air today,any link to this article or spot info?,venice. lel,surfers aren't stupid.,is that scorpion bay?,shit idk it's from surfer magazine i think probably about a year or so ago? i tried googling it but didn't find anything.,pretty sure its scorpion bay. check out some vids on youtube the place is amazing, almost never breaks good though,scorpion bay is in mexico that picture is of some secret break in the caribbean,am i missing something here? i thought it was an unspoken rule that you never post pics of your spot,meant this pic:,Surfing sounds like fun.,Whats the word on going to LA for a weekend and taking surf lessons? Should I just look on craigslist for someone who offers or should I goto a legit company that does this? I heard surfers are often unfriendly to beginners is that true?,ah yeah that looks like it could be.,if that was a rule surfing videos and magazines wouldn't exist. no one is giving anybody directions, and most of the spots named here are already overcrowded or common knowledge,Parking wasn't too bad when I was there, you have to park in a lot that is kind of off from where ever your dorm will be, but you can hop a bus get the car and then park in a 10 min spot closer to your room for board loading. It was like $240/340 for the year or $46 a month I think I graduated in 2005 though so I bet its gone up, East something was the name of the lot there is also a west one also. I had a beat up Suzuki for the second part of my year in dorms. Some people would park of campus in residential areas and then hop the bus down to there car when they needed it. That works better if you know someone in a house you can park in front of though. , There are a lot of sick spots that having a car would really be nice for. ,I threw my junk email in here if you have more questions.,I blew out my shoulder climbing and haven't really gotten back into the water yet. I 've been swimming for a little rehab I should get into the water in a week or so.,I don't know anything about the surf camps. everyone I know learned form friends. Most surfers wont be dicks as long as you don't get in there way. Try to find an uncrowded area of beach to learn in and you should be fine. ,You won't learn how to surf in a weekend. IT takes most people a whole season of going a few days a week. It's totally worth the work though.,youre a kook. go surf jenks brah,op is confirmed a kook,Need some help.. How would I go about getting better at surfing? I can get up on a long board and go left and right but that's about it ( biggest waves 3 feet ). How long would it take me to not look like a kook?,I'm very knowledgeable about waves and ""water-manners"" ( for lack of a better name ) because I'm good at bodyboarding.,you're past the biggest learning curve and at this point it's just practice. i would recommend trying to surf bigger waves, and maybe getting a different board, probably a fish or something.,Grew up surfing New England; RI, MA, & NH. Moved to SF. I surf from Bolinas to Santa Cruz, and sometimes Santa Barbara or Morro Bay.,Where in SB do you surf? I lived there for 4 years or so. I have a bunch of SB-area pics way further up in this thread.,I just surfed Sunset today (well, the top of Sunset not the proper West Bowl Sunset peak) and got pretty pounded. I spent half of my session duckdiving overhead closeouts in less than 2 feet of water over sharp ass reef, and it was pretty damn windy too. If you've ever surfed the spot you know how easy it is to get stuck inside here. ,Most of them were too lined up so it was closing out and it was really frustrating, but there were some nice corners to be had on some. Also it's nice to be in boardshorts in March lol, especially considering my hometown water temperature is below 50 right now. I got a couple really strong turns in which felt refreshing, and overall I was feeling more strong and flexible than usual. ,inb4 cool story bro I just wanted to share my rad session ;_;,sounds pretty great compared to the lack of size we've had here. i missed what will probably be the last decent session for a while b/c of school... on the brighter side i'm probably getting a board shaped this week,bamp,picked up my board earlier today i'll try to post some pictures at some point,Oregon summerbro here. Conditions are finally starting to clean up this week enough to pull out my favorite longboard.,New Boz wetsuit is ordered and on its way.,I'm sick of 50 degree water when the air is 70+, but I love my job as a teacher too much too move to better surfing locations. I doubt Australians need another american in the Byron Bay area or Nicaraguans need another educated gringo looking for ""modern life"".,bumpin,bampin ,Also, Indian Ocean reporting in.,Use a 6'1 REBEL board double concave square tail, with a pad. nice one that can stand little waves as well as more violent ones.,Maybe I could ask you a question: what do you guys think is the better thing in surfing? the most rewarding thing? ,I f°°°g love getting a barrel of course, also love it when I manage to pass a section that is closing. Also, feeling the movements of the sea under you when you are waiting, finding the best place to catch the wave according to the reef, the streams, the sets coming and your abilities. ,Pic is me in my homespot, really windy day but no one in the water.","HELP:

"So, can I post about SCA shit here or will I be laughed out of the board?,Did you go to Gulf Wars last week? Heard it was pretty good.,Even though it technically belongs here, I think you'd be better off on /tg/. I see these kinds of threads pop up there pretty regularly.,Personally, I really want to learn military fencing... maybe Bolognese. It's impossible to find education in it around where I live though... teachers just don't exist. You have to learn fucking italian and decipher ancient texts yourself to even think about learning the basics, and even then the books are ambiguous as fuck.,Anyone know of some good material for self-teaching, maybe?,I also just realized I ain't got shit for medieval-type pictures.,http://grauenwolf.wordpress.com/201,That page just raises a ton of questions, though. What the hell is a half-shield? A passing step? What does he mean by ""rolling the buckler""? What is a ""volta""?,I'm more lost than before!,Please, do post all you wish. ,We need more posts if we want to make it.,Yeah, he's really annoying with his ""I know more foreign words than you. What, you don't know what Vertch means? Oh, well."",But his workbooks are really good at getting you through the basics and giving you some drills to practice. My basic rule of thumb with that site is, if it's not in a .pdf, ignore it.,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH,/k/ommando here:,Even if SCA doesn't cut the mustard, I'm pretty sure it's /k/ related as well. ,On topic, I do like the swordwork you guys do. It's very different as compared to my knife and MA training.,I had a buddy who was into SCA. I used to rag on him for LARPing, and using a boffer to whack his friends in their tinfoil armor...until I actually went out and watched them train. I stopped cracking so many jokes after that.,It really impressed me. Those rattans aren't a joke, and their moves looked quite good. I also took a swing at my buddy with his stick to test out his kettle helm. I was quite favorably impressed with its performance. He was probably bullshitting me about little he felt it--acting all macho--but the fact that he was unfazed spoke a lot for the helmet. When I unload with a club, something generally breaks. As well as the helm protected him, it was a nice piece of gear.,I would like to give SCA a try somewhere down the road. Seems a good way to learn sword and board without having to go out of my way to find a place affiliated with HEMA or ARMA.,I am so lost and out of my depth...,Maybe I should let my dreams of martial training go, since I will never experience glory on the battlefield anyway... wrong century...,http://grauenwolf.wordpress.com/201,I've been doing SCA fighting for about a year and a half now. Lots of fun to beat people with sticks. I wanna try battle of the nations style fighting too but the cost of the armor and weapons for that is out of my price range for now.,Im okay with this,I cant ever find a place for posting SCA and WMA stuff,/tg/ is too much LARP oriented and /k/ is more about the weapons itself than the sport of Armored Combat,anyways pic related, its some of my set.,Nice sallet. Honestly, the best place to talk about SCA/WMA stuff is probably the armour archive, myarmoury, or the hema forums.,Yeah, but none of those places really have the 4chan ambiance. I just want to be able to call a fighter who over-values the edge of the blade over the point a ""Cutfag."",fuck what does sca stand for? ive been lookin to get into this shit for a while,You ever read Patton's method for the 1914 cavalry saber? He literally says that there's no reason to ever make a cut, or even parry. Instead of parrying, he says, just make another thrust.,Guy's an absolute pointfag.,That is very true. You a thrustfag?,Society for Creative Anachronism: http://www.sca.org/,thanks, the sallet is based on a replica they found under a convent or something like that. ,They dont know what the brass studs on the back were for, but I think they were for helping put it on.,heres my current set,heres a pic of me and my greatsword ""Clementine"",Honestly, I have no idea what manner of fag I am. There's no group close to me, so I don't have anyone to spar against. I'm just doing footwork and drills out of books until I have the leisure time to make a two hour commute once a week to join a group.,You should have used the ever dreaded hello kitty tape for clementine instead of just hot pink.,I just have a semi-decent late 14th century kit. No good pics of it though.,I made most of my stuff with the local garage armorer from my household except for the helm and gorget.,I mostly fight sword and board but wanna get into polearms soon.,believe it or not ive only been in the SCA for under 2 months heh,heres Clementine and Buttercup my Greatsword and Polehammer. First SCA weapons I ever did make. And as far as the armor I am self taught as far as arming points, positioning etc. go,forgot pic,I some questions for all you SCAdians out there,Do you prefer authenticity or comfort when choosing armor?,Sport armor or real armor?,I feel like I am at a serious tactical disadvantage against someone in plastic armor,I prefer authentic armor. I just think it looks so much better. As long as it's well made and fits you it shouldn't limit your mobility too much., A lot of metal SCA armor tends to be too heavy though especially if you're using 16g mild/stainless. Period armor would be made of hardened steel so you can use much thinner metal. Still won't be as light as plastic but if you're using something like 18-20g heat treated spring steel it will be a lot lighter than 16g mild and closer to the weight of historical armor.,i used to play football in highschool. that was the last time ive done a contact sport. ive been 6'3 250-300 forever, so whenever me and my friends tried doing backyard football or w/e they would all puss out and say id be 2 hand touch and they all could tackle.,all i wanna do is beat up some dude with a sword. i live in chicago, any places i can do that?,Not who you were replying to, but do you live in the LA area? I don't practice SCA, but I practice shinkendo, and we don't do live sparring, and I've been looking for a sparring partner (or any weapons sparring groups). I've contacted the SCA group out here but they require a yer of training with them (my 3 years of pre-set partner drills aren't enough I guess).,Rural Michigan, sorry.,Just go to the SCA or HEMA website and find a local group. Chicago should have both. I think there are also some ACL (Armored combat league) fighters near there if you wanna try battle of the nations style fighting but that is a lot more expensive and hardcore.,thanks for the info,Its not so much mobility for me as getting tired way faster than someone wearing carpet armor.,My girlfriend and I were sparring right now and after a solid hour I was so winded I couldnt even lift my arms to parry. and she bashed me with the polehammer easily (she was wearing nothing but work gloves lol),Well if you've only been doing it for 2 months you could just not be used to wearing the armor. You'll last longer the more you fight and you can just do general /fit/ness stuff for that.,Also here is what battle of the nations looks like for those that don't know: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCL8,yeah I will admit I am out of shape and have shit stamina lol,Im from the Kingdom of Caid btw (southern California) in the Barony of Dreiburgen.,and Battle of Nations is fucking hardcore, full contact with blunted steel is no joke. The only thing I dont like about BoN is that lots of times they seem to bash people more than what would seem realistic in a fight. Like not going for a ""lethal"" shot and instead just hitting the dude in the head for more points.,I'm in the East Kingdom.,Yeah the thing with BotN is you have to either get them to submit or knock them down and thrusting isn't allowed for safety reasons so pretty much bashing them repeatedly in the head is the best thing to do if you can't knock the guy over.,I have so many aspirations for myself in the SCA. Unfortunately there isnt a large amount of people in my area like there used to be. I would love to do unit fighting in wars eventually. Something that I believe I would fare better in than 1 vs 1.,I really wish the rules of the Lists as it were, would take into account armor type and locations. Instead if it being ""everyone is assumed to be wearing a chain hauberk"". For example if I am fighting a dude with leather arm armor while im wearing my metal plates. and either of us strikes each other in the arms, both of us would lose that arm no matter the type of armor were wearing.,That sucks that there isn't enough people locally. The best thing to do would be to just make the trip to any of the larger wars you can get to. And yeah I know what you mean with the armor types but the assumed standard also make it a little more even/balanced since it takes the same to kill everyone. There are some events like the combat of the thirty at pennsic and the deed of arms at gulf wars that do use modified rules where you take hits based on the armor as worn.,...That makes it so much simpler.,[spoiler]Maybe I can at least have an epic battle with the local plantlife.[/spoiler],I'll set to carving myself a training cane straight away!,...I don't think I know how to make a buckler though.,HOW DO YOU SEE.,I'm too used to /tg/ I guess, that I would forget there are no spoilers here.,Pic unrelated, a actual sport.,bro you need to train them fucking legs.,Sport (or, primarily in North America, sports) is all forms of competitive physical activity which,[1] through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and provide entertainment to participants. from wikipedia,Anyways I love fencing and I fenced in college. But this =>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC,What does SCA think of HEMA? My HEMA group is mostly SCA guys and they all kinda look down on SCA. Mostly because you use real steel in HEMA for everything save for some tourneys. ,Yeah its a sport, not a martial art. An Olympic fencer might score a one light point on a SCA but the the SCA guy will beat the shit out of him a second later. Fencing is as bad as amateur boxing.,I joined my uni's SCA group, but I haven't been to any of their meetings.,I'm kind of scared.,Is SCA a good way to go if you just want to learn how to do some medieval fightan and have an excuse to buy/wear plate armor, or are there groups which focus more heavily on the fighting end? I've heard SCA comes with a lot of RP stuff, which I am not opposed to (fa/tg/uy here) but ultimately I'd rather learning swordplay take priority.,Yes and No. The SCA has rules that can sometimes limit the realism, such as strike zones, the above mentioned armor rules etc. Most Talhoffer techniques are illegal.,There are lots of other cool stuff in the SCA like arts and sciences stuff. I have heard of people meeting their wives in the sca too,If you just want to learn swordplay look for a HEMA group. They treat it as a serious martial art rather than as a sport or some kind of game.,A lot of SCA guys also do the HEMA stuff to pad out their training.,all tose nice, bloodsoaked Memories...,Just curious as to what weapons you SCAdians out there use?,I use the aforementioned greatsword and polehammer. It seems lots of people like to go sword and board. Ive never trained with a shield at all though.,lol it saysd dick and it also says berned like dickberned,Pfft- those underoos are almost as hilarious as the turtles pajamas.,haha yes my clothes are very historically acurate,Sure is second-rate in here.,Enjoy your right-of-way rules you burning homosexual.,holy shit, it's the dark knight.,Bitchin',flicking each other with what amounts to a radio antenna vs clubbing people with sticks while in armor. Are you even trying fencing?,sup guise dark knight here,I am about to punch a hole into my breast/backplate to add a place for an arming tie on the sword arm pauldron.,Tell me what you think but its just not quite sitting up on my shoulder enough in my oppinion. pic related. ,ill be using a ball hammer, and a punch pin to make the hole and a rail road rail as an anvil finish the hole and bend everything back into shape,Ask here before you do anything: http://forums.armourarchive.org/php,This is why that girl is your gf.,Are the slippers mandatory?,Aethelmearc bro here. I started two-sticking cause I wanted to bring in the bitches and because shields are for pussies. Even though I was good with them, year and a half later I have come to realize Shields ain't really for pussies. Basically fight with a shield and you'll learn where their weakness is. Also I love fighting Great weapons, they die so easy.,Is it sad I know these pics are from Pennsic because I recognize the landscape?,Nah it's pretty obvious it's the combat of the thirty.,aw shit man, what barony? Bmdl? I think I might know you. Is that shiro you are fighting?,Sunderoak. Specifically Stormhaven. Though I've went to more than a few bmdl practices. ,No that's not Shiro. I cant remember his name, just that he's a very large black man. And Shiro is more of a older white man.,I would really love to get into this. Unfortunately it seems like the chapter that used to exist in the region where I live doesn't exist anymore. Anyone here active in Michigan?,I'm really interested in the coinmaking guild that they have. I belong to their mailing list, it would be awesome to learn how to do this stuff.,A couple questions about SCA:,Oh I know who you are talking about. I forget his name, but I know him. I think I recognise your armor, although I haven't been to as many fight practices as I should.,beatsticks and swishy-pokes don't cross over. Different armor/safety standards,As far as I know, the timeframe of the SCA just recently expanded to include some firearms[spoiler]much to quite a fews cargrin[/spoiler] So i've heard some meantion of things like that, it's prolly few and far between.,Sorry, don't know. Not interested so I never would have payed attention.,If you've seen me you would have seen my friend too.,Out of curiosity does Ün approve?,I'm pretty horrible with names, but knowing me, probably not.,I'm not sure if I know you. I recognise both of your armors, but I don't think I know you. Maybe I'll see you around at a practice one of these days.,Epee all day,You best keep going by ""Dark Knight"" now.,It's the perfect name for the least-white knight in any given fight.,How do you make a safe-for-playing-around-with musket, exactly?,If there's a market for it, I might just join these games as a specialist gunner. I could handle a dozen muskets easy.,Gonna be honest, fighting as a Musketeer would be pretty awesome. Or if you wanted to go full Stormfront, a Conquistador. One shot, then go in with bayonet or rapier and dagger or cut-and-thrust sword an buckler.,Search Martial Arts for some HEMA groups around LA. A few of them do basic sparring from the get go.,search meetup com that is supposed to say,My nigga,Here's a handy chart to help understand why what you do is not a sport.,Personally I love fencing small sword, but it's not a sport either. You claim HEMA/SCA is dueling, but it's not. Dueling is dirty, dueling is pommeling your opponent in the throat, throwing dust in his face. You not simulating duels. You're not the real thing either, but you're awful quick to judge fencing.,Yeah, and I'm a pretty good shot with my sidearm, who cares?,By that flowchart logic, Archery would not be a sport.,Bzzzz, wrong.,Any players tried siege? I've been trying to get into SCA for a while, but being an amputee, I have trouble with my stances when it comes to the standard heavy fighting, and I don't have the mobility or skill with a bow to go proper light, so I was thinking I would go siege. Means I can rest my leg, and not ruin it so later on I can enjoy the social side to the fullest.,In the Lochac kingdom, in the shire of Bordescros, so I'm not entirely sure on the legality over here (Australia) as we do have some pretty strict regulations thanks to the insurance over here.,Any Michiganders here involved in this?,I never said anything derogatory towards fencing,I used to fence in college. I just find armored combat to be more FUN. And by your flowchart it is a sport,this dude has all this ornate engraved armor but his blade tape is going the wrong way according to his hilt,anyways I think I got my pauldron where I want it now it sits a bit more where i think it should be. It still articulates well and all that.,lol meant no on the eating part,that comes after the battle,Well, this didn't take long /asp/ies.,It is part of the culture in every form of martial art/fighting/simulated war.,See paintball vs. airsoft,Except the melee based versions all have one thing they are very good at simulating, and very bad at everything else.,SCA- Headshots and pretty armor, but no grappling and not much offensive shield work, no shots below the knees.,Heavy boffer games(Belegarth, Dagorhir and the like)-No headshots, but shots to the shins are fair game, but grappling and shield bashing/edging are allowed and encouraged,light boffer games- fencing with cheap equipment and a lack of skilled participants,fencing-a different style of swordplay that isnt heavy armored combat and focuses more on small bits of finesse where in heavy combat types you can just power through blocks with enough effort.,Is that supposed to mean grey wolf or horrorwolf?,What's the matter, too complicated for you, pleb?,anyways Im about to head to practice in a bit will come back with videos,It's mothafuckin' Snoop Doggy Dogg!,Right-of-way is for faggots,If I was to do it, I'd make a pistol rapier as my melee weapon, and my ranged weapon would be just two or three muskets that I'd practice quick-switching.,There are considerations that would need to be made, and I'd probably have to adapt or invent techniques for all of this, but it'd be worth it to see all the mad I could cause.,I still don't see how you can make a safe-to-use-on-people musket, though. What would it be, spring-loaded?,I think you'd probably have to have something like an airsoft gun that shoots 1.25"" diameter balls to make it work.,single shot spring paintball?,Nerf anything. They make dart launchers, football launchers, and foam ball launchers. I'd recommend the foam balls.,That's you, and you're stupid. Any move that results in a loss, or a draw when a win is attainable, is a bad move.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUL,Where do you guys meet? I'm from the San Bernardino/Riverside area and have been interested in getting into this for awhile.,http://www.dreiburgen.org/Meetings.,The RP stuff mostly comes into play in the political structure. For me, I go to my local group and train rapier once a week, and then occasionally head to some event. I mostly go to the ones with tournaments though, besides having to deal with the stuff at the events, I haven't had to deal with any RP.,For main hand, it doesn't really cross over. So you won't usually see a rapier versus a longsword for the simple reason that the safety and rules just don't exist. You might see a dagger main hand against a rapier main hand though. In rapier, off hand weapons are crossed all the time. Rapier/cloak versus Rapier/cane is a very reasonable thing to see.,Your girlfriend is a fucking troll,I think it's rubber bullets or something. I don't really know.,nah, the paint would ruin some of the equipment.,and get in peoples eyes through bar grills or eye slots...,that too, which is why a normal airsoft bullet probably wouldn't work either.,SCA doesn't have a strong presence in Michigan, unfortunately.,That's a shame, but understandable. Who regulated the rules with SCA, out of curiosity?,The SCA has set of rules that are society wide and encompass the whole organization and then each individual kingdom is allowed to add to the basic rule set.,No idea, I just started in January. I'm mostly interested in learning rapier right now so anything else is just whatever spills over. From what I understand, you can get other weapons approved, like someone at my practice does Scimitar or something like that. I don't think it's harder to get new weapons introduced because a lot of consideration has to go into it and then it needs to get popular if you want other people to fight with it.,Thanks. How big is the group by the way?,No idea. I'm on the other side of the country, I just found the local barony for you.,Scimitar, that's awesome. I'm not even sure how you would properly wield that one.,Oh okay, I assumed you were there guy I was originally responding too, sorry to bother.,meant for,Opinions on EMP?,I saw a few videos of EMP pit fighting. It seemed pretty cool.,Another fencefag here.,Haven't done it in probably about six or more years now, but I did enjoy it. I was always a foilist because it made for more impressive bladework, back and forth and that stuff, what with right of way such an important thing to attain. ,I never knew much about epee but it's my understanding it must take a lot more strategy considering double-touches and all of that stuff being possible. But I never liked the idea that if you're coming in for an attack the guy can just attack you back and...then what? Two scores or somebody just backpedals. It seems to me that any intricate actual sword fighting back-and-forth would eventually devolve when some guy, who is parried, instead of preparing to parry the opponent's oncoming repost, says, ""Fuck it, I'm just gonna go for it,"" and continues through, while the other guy reposts, resulting in a double-touch.,I suppose it's more realistic but in a realistic fight everyone would be cautious as fuck and not just ""go for it."" But again I truly knew little of epee, someone educate me. ,I always wanted to take a class at my old academy, they called it Historical Fencing - Rapier. I've always loved the rapier because of the fact you slash and thrust with it. The offhand dagger stuff was always kind of neat too. But, it's not a sport, so I didn't know how much there was to it.,And then I understand sabre is just about charging at each other.,nice boat,Saber seems the most removed out of historical accuracy for the other two, but I don't know much about it. Always liked the look of it though.,to answer your question the fighter group I attended tonight there were like 7 of us,add this group to your FB, you will see me there and we can kick it, forge, make weapons and most of all fight.,add Dreiburgen newcomers on facebook,cool, just sent a request to join the group,/sp/ had battle of nations gamethreads when that happened,bump,According to that chart, chess is a race.,I'm the fencing guy and I'll agree, right of way has gotten way out of hand.,And that's why Epee is still best weapon.,I've done some small sword vs rapier at a classical fencing club. It's interesting, but turns to infighting quickly and rules rules rules.,Epee doesn't have shit on pole arms,Should do small sword vs rapier with only the most basic safety rules so nobody dies.,what is robocop doing in the 15th century?,Fucking all the bitches as they be mirin' his armor,That is some excellent looking armor.,Is there any of this in England at all, or is it all Post-colonials trying really bloody hard to live a history they bought out of?,(I'm just fucking with you, guys, I'm actually just really interested in this and want to see if I can join in. My gut says it'll be super expensive, though.),There is more western martial arts (HEMA, etc.) in Europe than SCA. There's also battle of the nations which is going to be in France this May I believe.,That's correct. The epee was a gentlemen dueling sword.,I don't associate with the common filth of foot solders. You don't need a dueling sword because you have no honor to defend. ,Pic unrelated, faggot foilist looking cool.,Except Pollaxes, Pole hammers, etc. were knightly weapons. Too expensive for common rabble. Those fuckheads get spears and bills made by the village black smith,.,So I stand corrected. I asked some people from my practice today, and if you do cut and thrust rapier, which has different rules and safety than heavy rapier (which is where you will generally if not always start), you can actually use any sword. As long as you know the rules and follow them, you can use a different sword other than rapier. Which I believe is how the guy here uses a scimitar.,video from tonights practice,me getting owned by one of the higher ups,I also got one of my gauntlets broken lol,http://tinypic.com/r/24y4ap4/6,I sincerely hope that you are the Black Knight.,We call him the Dark Knight. Because he is the armorfag we deserve.,You'd be amazed if you knew how many times that joke's been made on /tg/ before this. Frankly, at this point, I find his choice of pajamas and legwear funnier these days.,Bitch, you better quit while you're ahead!,Dark Knight here,And this is why you dont parry with your hand lol,Todays project will at very least be repair but I want to curve the edges in towards the palm for added finger protection.,tools are ,That's a pretty major failure. Did a rivet break/pop out or did the plate actually rip open?,the rivet popped out from the washer after i took a huge hit to the hand from the kingoms Duke (he was going easy on me too),Ah ok that isn't as bad then as long as your hands didn't get fucked up from the blow. You could also use steel roofing nails as a replacement rivet instead of a bolt but I'm not sure what kind of bolt you're talking about. Make sure you cut the nail/bolt to length before you peen it down too.,thats a really good suggestion im having trouble finding a good thin bolt int he garage,what the fuck is this,larping?,It's more of a sport than larping. There isn't really any role playing in the fighting aspect other than people having funny names. No magic/hit points or shit like that either. Just look up SCA heavy fighting on youtube.,SCA Heavy Armor Combat,Full contact sport with armor and rattan (solid type of bamboo) weapons. ,2 days of practice I got 2 bruised shoulders, bruised elbow, smashed hand, blood from someplace unknown. All in good fun mate,And didn't utter a single complaint, did you?,I like that about you SCA bros, you guys don't whine. Catch a rattan in the calf, you swear, the other guy says sorry, and you butch up and keep fighting.,Use fishing weight? Non lead, of course, don't wanna poison that ground),to be honest i actually enjoyed it haha,my dad does.,ever hear of will campion?,Fuck yeah SCA thread.,I recently picked up padded compression shorts since my hip has been sore and swollen for about a month. Later today I'm going down to my buddy's shop and I'm gonna finish up my new splinted legs, then I'll come home and finish up the garb I need for Ice Dragon next week.,Make the muskets airguns and use bean bags or similar ""large"" ammunition.,Was able to repurpose the same bolt and washer,its all fixed inside and out,my first actually repair job from battle,and a view of the inside of the bolt,I basically filed down the flat edges so I could fit the washer back on it...then I flattened the inside end of the bolt to hold the washer on,only issue I ran into was it doesnt articulate as well as the other one now,not that critical but still,Did you peen the rivet all the way down? For articulation rivets you really only want to flatten it just enough that the washer stays on so that the plate can still rotate freely on the rivet. If you smash the rivet head down too much you just end up locking the plates together.,SCA is pretty cool. There is a lot painstaking attention paid to a lot of the artsy/craftier stuff, a lot of effort towards making things historically authentic and legitimate in how clothing, equipment and other types of crafts are made. ,About the only thing in SCA that /isn't/ very authentic is the part every is most interested in: Heavy fighting.,It's certainly an admirably developed and complex way of fighting with sticks, but anyone interested in learning swordsmanship as an actual martial discipline without the trappings of the culture of SCA would be better suited to find a HEMA/ARMA place, I think.,I think the actual plate is bent from the impact the rivet still has enough length to articulate but it just wont because of the metal plates hitting,todays project:,theres a good amount of info here > http://www.bellatrix.org/school/,specifically aimed at SCA combat,legs just need to have straps put on but otherwise they are done, today after I eat and watch star trek I'm going to make a pattern for chausses, make some chausses, and finish my new gambeson.,Musketeer Anon here.,I already mentioned I'd like to look into the sport, but I don't know where to begin and google isn't helping much with the musket stuff. Can someone point me to the proper rules and regulations for muskets, and maybe an event list or something that'll let me find events in my area?,I don't think there are any rules for muskets since nobody uses them as far as I know. There are rules for archery and crossbows though. If you want to try to make a musket I'd try to line up with the archery rules and then you'd have to get it approved by a marshal to try out at an event. Here is the main website for the SCA: http://www.sca.org/ you're going to want to figure out what kingdom you are in and then go to the kingdom website. From there you can find a local group and see the kingdom event list.,From what I can find care of Wikipedia, the muskets use surgical tubing loops that are fired rubber band gun style... and they require the same armor standards as the fencing.,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCA_fe,saved,why did he delete his file, i cant see it?,posted in another thread here ya go,On the other hand, Rapier uses real swords; not live blades, but still. I don't remember if I heard correctly, but I thought I heard one of the older knights in the Kingdom of the West saying that they used to use real swords and stuff. Not sure how true that is.,Snoop? Niggawhatchupromotinnow?,I had to quit the SCA when the only group in my area banned headshots as valid blows, and instead started calling them unsportsmanlike.,I have somewhere around 6 inches on almost everyone else around me. This rule put me at such a major disadvantage that I could no longer enjoy myself.,I dare say, that stabbing someone in the belly with a mace, cracking all the ribs and letting the poor man lie in his own feces for minutes before death is far more unsportsmanlike.,I know, it's fucking absurd. Worse is that it was basically a knee-jerk reaction because some kid got himself hurt.,What the fuck? The flatsnap to the head is like the most basic and standard shot in the SCA.,Sounds like that kid needs to learn how to parry.,Dark Knight here,What Barony is that? What a shame,also todays project:,tools:,Anyways, Anyone from Cali going to the Knewbie Knockabout in Wintermist,What are you making the cuisses out of and are planning on just using floating cops or articulation?,motherfucking pickle barrel unfortunately,I am going to attach the plastic plates to my metal knee cops seen here ,I need to have better knee/leg protection for knewbie knockabout and I cant afford the Milanese cuisses I want right now,I am basing the pattern something similar to this dude - http://www.angelfire.com/oh4/Boris/,also I dont have a forge or blowtorch so I will be heating the plastic to be shaped with a barbeque full of red hot mesquite lol,Is there a decent presence in Florida? I want to check it out. I heard you can dick around and bad it up if the instrument is in the proper time period is this true?,You could try to make gambesoid cuisses if you can sew. They'll look better than plastic. Or if you need the rigid protection make the gambesoid cuisses with either very little filling/none and just have a pocket sewn in the inside to put plastic plates in. At the very least cover up the plastic by gluing fabric over top or something similar.,Also you can get cheap canvas at walmart for like $5 a yard.,thats a really good idea, i am ripping apart an old jacket of mine that has quilted patters and nearly the perfect shape. heavy canvas too, thanks for the idea,You know if you go to Home Depot or Lowes (or any hardware store really) and pick up a box of roofing nails (galvanized for steel, aluminum for aluminum or plastic) and a set of smaller bolt cutters you can just use the nails as rivets.,Does this gives you physical condition?,wat,Enjoy your second-rate sport you low-tier loser.,Let me know when you can actually handle a fight with a real swordsman.,It's good for physical conditioning. It really helps your health and all that. Good exercise.,Your English is a little hard to understand.,Minimums except for vambraces and thighs. Calontir signing in.,Nifty thread for a new board! ,I'm moderately practiced in Escrima. I enjoy it greatly and practice pretty faithfully (on trips into the worse parts of the city I even bring my rattan sticks). My question is this: if I were to get in to SCA, what sort of limitations exist on the type of weaponry you can use? I'm sure I wouldn't be able to just bring my sticks in, nor would I necessarily want to, but how close could I get to the same weight and length/feel of them with what I am allowed to use? ,Also, will I be at a disadvantage scoring-wise using Escrima style? For those unfamiliar, its dual sticks, focused around very quick stings and smacks on armored opponents in an effort to fatigue them to the point where they can't defend the seams in the connecting pieces of their armor. ,tl;dr Escrima knowledge/proficiency translates well to SCA y/n?,For SCA rattan has to be 1.25"" diameter at the minimum for any portion of the weapon that could contact another person (you can shave the handles down if you want) and then you just tape it with strapping tape and then a layer of duct tape to make sure splinters don't go all over/into people. Sticks can be pretty much whatever length you want for single handed weapons. Pole arms can be 7.5 ft max, spears 9ft max. Plenty of people fight with 2 single handed swords so you should be able to use your Escrima style. I'd imagine most of it would carry over but I don't know very much about Escrima.,I don't get that stuff. You get all dressed up in seemingly authentic armor and then it devolves into tackling each other and pushing people down on the ground because your weapons aren't worth the dirt you're standing on.,I wouldn't say the weapons aren't worth the dirt you're standing on. If you look at a lot of the armor after it's been through some battles it's dented to hell. But even so, the armor works so pretty much most weapons aren't that effective. Even in period the best way to kill an armored man was to get him on the ground and stab him through the eye slots with a dagger or some other gap in the armor.,It's better to thrust at them with some sort of spear or wail on them with something else. Getting hit in the head even witha good helmet will do a lot if you aren't just using a small sword.,If you're one on one it might be easier to get him on the ground, but since it's a battle you'll just open yourself up to his buddies.,Are there any special allowances or rules for strange and gimmicky weapons or fighting styles?,I have been reading on unusual medieval weapons in general because of my plans on a gunblade...,At this point, I'm of the opinion that just about any kind of weird concept must have at least one or two attempts, even if it's a crazy idea--like the axe-musket and similar.,With that in mind, I have some other questions--are there rules in place for blunt-striking with things not usually used in melee, like the body of a rifle? If you were to get the previously mentioned axe-musket onto a mixed combat field, or a bayoneted musket... would you be able to make strikes with the butt of the rifle as well? Would they count at all?,I'm thinking that I'd want to try using a rifle in a fashion like a short spear, a shortened poleaxe, or some sort of half-length staff. If possible, I'd like to be able to use a musket to the complete exclusion of a 'true' melee weapon (for style's sake) but I'm not completely sure about the rules on things like that... it's really hard to find the official rulebook. I can't seem to track it down. Can we call this thread a general and get a link to it for the OP post or something?,It has to be canon. If you can find an example of it in history, it's fine. Generally most weapons don't have rounded or curbed ends to prevent accidents like breaking arms by torque or whatnot. The ends of rifles don't count as martial weapons unfortunately. ,A half-staff isn't a bad idea. Look up the idea of Christian fighting style - it's one shorter stave and one sword. As far as a general, it's too early to determine that.,Well, I suppose it depends on how strict someone considers ""Canon"",There are a lot of strange things that you can find poking around.,The only problem I have is that the specific combination I want shows up in fiction, and in fiction only... because, to be fair, it doesn't make that much sense... or, honestly, any sense at all.,I fell in love with Paulus Hector Mair's teaching of the scythe, you see..,Anyway, I'd settle for being able to use axehead muskets and such, but I'd really love to be able to have a rifle butt treated as a blunt weapon. Is there at least an appeals process or something I could give a try to?,If not, I suppose I'll just have to fall back on the good old extremely justifiable rapier-pistol gunblade,SCA Rule book: http://www.sca.org/officers/marshal,Dark Knight here,What a fucking chore it was to put the flanges on my knee cops.,I used only hand tools, no electricity, hack saw, metal file, ball hammer, masonry hammer, carpentry nails, anvil.,In retrospect I should have chosen a easier shape than a club with 3 circles lol. It took me so darn long to just make one of them.,Also I sort of raged when I couldnt peen down the rivets. Basically I tried to put the rivets on both the outside and inside but couldnt get the right angle to hit it with the hammer and peen it. So I raged and just bashed the bolts down into place. Surprisingly its actually sturdy.

Most everyone can trace their heritage back to some place besides the US. It may not be as immediate, but so what? Besides, do you have to be from Europe or Asia to have an interest in the culture and the history? Definitely not.,shiny armour in the southeast is kinda a poor choice, while yes it looks nice, it makes you a target like hell. ,means the armour is new and doesnt have many miles on it. and or that person doesnt have much practice. while get you beat to shit or the armour dented. ,pic from when i was younger,but you will see polearms around here to,Has anybody tried these pole hammer heads for SCA fighting? http://revival.us/talhoffer1467rubb,Anyone have links to beginners gear on the cheap or instructions?

"I've been practicing Jiu jitsu for about 2 1/2 years now and I've recently come into a plateau. I am a blue belt, and I was given my first stripe a week ago and yet i don't feel like i deserve it. I don't feel like I'm at this level since there are so many others around me who are so much better when we spar. Does anyone else go through these doubts and what did you do to get help?,you should punch them,Just talk to your teacher if it bothers you that much. Ask him why he chose to raise you up a grade. You aren't fishing for compliments or anything, just ask him to give you a rundown on what he feels your skills and weaknesses lie. Otherwise, just roll dude, belts are just strips of cloth anyway.,He keeps telling us (the two other blue belts and I) That we're ready and we know our stuff and all that. He does say that I need to be more aggressive when we spar and actually use muscle instead of being a ""dish rag/jellyfish/rag doll/etc."" But i have this paranoia about losing technique if i use strength.,3 Stripe blue here. Don't feel bad, blue belt is a weird ass level, the skill sets are more varied in this division than any other,it is after all the longest jump between belts. Try popping into some other schools and rolling with some fresh blue, you might get crushed or you just might succeed.,What.... you get your tech down through fucking up white belts and drilling it over and over, when your roll... crush their asses! wtf man,I guess I'm too nice when I roll. I work escapes and defenses and really try to let myself get in a bad spot then find the best way out but in terms of dominance, in terms of ""winning"" the fight, I submit opponents from inferior positions more often than starting out strong. It's not a good habit to have all the time and that's why i feel plateaued because i am afraid to try being aggressive.,afraid of what? being called out? hurting someone? Always be aggressive, always be dominant. I'm not saying be a dick and grind your chin into peoples eyes, but if your rolling people at your level or above and you are not in it 100% of course your gonna lose, wtf else would happen?,I guess i'm afraid i'd miss out on learning my escapes and helping my defense. I have always been more of a defensive person than offensive. I wish i could be aggressive when i spar but i always seem so concerned with trying to learn that i don't actually learn...and then i get hurt by the aggro white belt trying to kill me,There you go, you just answered your own problem, don't be weak. you can still learn plenty with using strength, don't buy into that old school bjj bullshit about jiu-jitsu not requiring strength, that shit sickens me, watch top tier black belts roll.... THEY ARE COMING AFTER EACH OTHER!,Hey thanks alot, I realize that my problem isn't really a big deal but you guys really helped me out. I'm going to try being aggressive tomorrow when i go train and i'll be sure to keep in mind that you learn while being strong and not being a ""dishrag/ragdoll/jellyfish/ etc."" I've been called those things wayyyy too many times.,Ah, this is why I practice Chinese martial arts.

If not then no.,ever been to a tity bar? bitches compete for tips.,I have never been to a titty bar and this saddens me greatly.,how is that possible? it is a right of passage for any male,i saw poledancing competitions at the arnold sports festival. looks pretty athletic and there are competitions so i'd say it's a sport,Pole-dancing is a genuine form of gymnastics that has been taken for use in strip-clubs. Is gymnastics /asp/ort?,I understand they are little kids and they are just playing, but you realize that school is scamming those parents that think their kids are actually learning something.,at that age the are still able to grasp the basics,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L1a,no, it is an exhibition.,sports have points which the player scores directly, exhibitions are opinion based and scored by judges that determine the winner.,all have scoring systems which make them sports.,pole dancing?,NO,I need to make sure to watch more Judo,Now that's how you tebow!,I'll dump some gifts I guess,it looks like he probably got his ass kicked after that.,Whoa.,Does anyone want me to keep dumping?,Yes, please,looks like he tried to tap out as he was picking him up.,I'll continue posting after the new season of Game of Thrones is over,Cool, thread should still be here.,So...anymore poledancing gifs?,HOLY SHIT,IS THISREAL?!!,my goodness, that was the best feint I have ever seen,is there a name for that move or did he just make it up on the fly,Don't know if faking or setup, awesome either way,no I saw that on TV, the guy in white just got cocky and went in for the kill but left himself open, the other guy was hurt but not hurt enough to pass up his chance,the gif is a little slowed down, happened faster than how it looks,What, how he ended up in the bottom like a dipshith?,when the judo guy finishes his throw, his opponent land's feet first against the cage wall, the guy then kicks off the cage wall before the judo guy can roll on top of him into mount and the judo guy winds up in guard instead.,Yes, that was my point. He is on the bottom. He failed.,Look at those little autists,Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,,those good ol' forbiden techniques...,he did,wasn't really an ass kicking, more of a boring decision, the other guy pretty much LNP afterwards. But the judo guy didn't really have much of a guard, just held him down and didnt go for any subs,I remember watching this with /sp/ as it went down, we all lost our collective minds.,Still hope for a rematch eventually.,Holy shit, that Harai o Goshi.,Also, behold this beautiful Ashi Gatame.,isn't that an illegal move? you aren't supposed to use the cage like that,As long as you don't grab onto it to prevent a takedown you can do whatever you want,Why in the fuck does the guy put his hands down at the last second?,That occurred in like the last minute of a 5 rnd championship fight, dude was tired.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZBa,I was gonna say it looked staged, but that makes sense.,funny thing is he switched from MMA to boxing",,"03/30/13(Sat)17:02,03/30/13(Sat)17:03,03/30/13(Sat)17:05,03/30/13(Sat)17:06,03/30/13(Sat)17:09,03/30/13(Sat)17:16,03/30/13(Sat)17:20,03/30/13(Sat)17:21,03/30/13(Sat)17:22,03/30/13(Sat)17:25,03/30/13(Sat)17:26,03/30/13(Sat)17:28,03/30/13(Sat)17:30,03/30/13(Sat)17:43,03/30/13(Sat)17:46,03/30/13(Sat)17:47,03/30/13(Sat)18:25,03/30/13(Sat)18:29,03/30/13(Sat)20:04,03/30/13(Sat)20:10,03/30/13(Sat)20:10,03/30/13(Sat)20:14,03/30/13(Sat)20:17,03/30/13(Sat)20:19,03/30/13(Sat)20:20,03/30/13(Sat)22:55,03/30/13(Sat)23:07,03/31/13(Sun)22:51,03/31/13(Sun)22:52,03/31/13(Sun)23:07,03/31/13(Sun)23:09,03/31/13(Sun)23:10,03/31/13(Sun)23:11,03/31/13(Sun)23:12,03/31/13(Sun)23:17,03/31/13(Sun)23:18,03/31/13(Sun)23:19,03/31/13(Sun)23:22,03/31/13(Sun)23:23,03/31/13(Sun)23:26,03/31/13(Sun)23:27,03/31/13(Sun)23:30,03/31/13(Sun)23:31,03/31/13(Sun)23:35,03/31/13(Sun)23:36,03/31/13(Sun)23:36,03/31/13(Sun)23:38,03/31/13(Sun)23:39,03/31/13(Sun)23:41,03/31/13(Sun)23:42,03/31/13(Sun)23:43,03/31/13(Sun)23:44,03/31/13(Sun)23:46,03/31/13(Sun)23:47,03/31/13(Sun)23:48,03/31/13(Sun)23:52,04/01/13(Mon)00:25,04/01/13(Mon)00:33,04/01/13(Mon)00:40,04/01/13(Mon)00:48,04/01/13(Mon)01:01,04/01/13(Mon)01:23,04/01/13(Mon)01:24,04/01/13(Mon)01:25,04/01/13(Mon)01:38,04/01/13(Mon)01:42,04/01/13(Mon)02:00,04/01/13(Mon)02:33,04/01/13(Mon)02:34,04/01/13(Mon)02:35,04/01/13(Mon)02:36,04/01/13(Mon)02:37,04/01/13(Mon)02:38,04/01/13(Mon)03:34,04/01/13(Mon)03:44,04/01/13(Mon)04:08,04/01/13(Mon)05:19,04/01/13(Mon)06:19,04/01/13(Mon)13:18,04/01/13(Mon)13:20,04/01/13(Mon)13:28,04/01/13(Mon)13:40,04/01/13(Mon)14:05,04/01/13(Mon)15:06,04/01/13(Mon)15:23,04/01/13(Mon)15:35,04/01/13(Mon)15:52,04/01/13(Mon)16:14,04/01/13(Mon)16:20,04/01/13(Mon)16:22,04/01/13(Mon)16:28,04/01/13(Mon)16:29,04/01/13(Mon)16:30,04/01/13(Mon)16:31,04/01/13(Mon)19:18,04/01/13(Mon)22:04,04/01/13(Mon)22:07,04/01/13(Mon)22:26,04/01/13(Mon)22:28,04/01/13(Mon)22:29,04/01/13(Mon)22:30,04/01/13(Mon)22:32","Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"
"Old thread hit the bump limit ,man you know that one paintball kid and hes all yea dud i go down to camp pendleton like every weekend to get my tags on and hes like super into paintball and in the end everone is just like ahaha what a paintball kid,Riveting tale, chap,repoting in,thinking about getting a smoke lens for my proto switch. anyone use smoke lenses? it won't impair my vision that much, would it? i'm assuming that it would be just like wearing sunglasses,Lol'd,I bought a Torque recently. It's really not a bad hopper once you configure the magnets so that the drive cone isn't constantly spinning.,Pretty much. And just like sunglasses, wearing smoke lenses indoors will seriously affect your ability to see. But they're fine when used outside.,might get a mirror lens instead, but i'm still wondering about the visibility.,sage because i just bumped a second ago and this is a slow board,awesome, thanks. i don't play much indoor anyway, but i'm tired of playing outside on a bright, sunny day and having to look past the reflection of my eyes in the lens,even if you have the Smoke lens indoors it doesn't effect you much. indoors/outdoors it works fine.,Maybe if the place is well-lit, but in my experience most indoor fields have pretty poor lighting.,you go to camp pendleton too? We've got to play some woodball together,Any recommendations on gloves? Fucking, it seems like Empire is the only company that makes gloves and they're shit tier quality.,golf gloves > professional gloves,I like fingerless bike gloves, but BLACKHAWK!, Hatch, Camelback, WileyX, and Oakley all make great gloves. You just have to step out of the ""for paintball"" mentality and look at military gear, too.,Pictured: My favorite set of gloves when I was active duty. I carried a pair at all times.,Unless you can get them for insanely cheap, you should never buy gloves or shoes made by paintball companies. They are always overpriced.,Get some Ironclad Tac-Ops gloves. Good gloves, they're like 20$,captcha never drkill,Mechanix gloves.,Do you even Operate?,They're nice, but a bit thin for my tastes. Some of the other guys liked them, though. And I was Signal, which meant moving big, heavy, fragile and expensive shit around.,I got some smoke lenses on my grills. after a couple seconds you don't really notice. i usually forget i'm wearing them.,What about Eclipse? I have an older pair of fingerless gloves that are great.,Very true, though they're usually great for padding/bounces. Empire used to make pretty awful stuff though.,Personally I only use it to mark trees and bunkers. Not as a means of aiming aid. I suppose it wouldn't be a bad idea, however the refs have given me enough shit as it is so I rather keep it down to a minimal use.,Not to mention that I've been called out falsely before by other plays for ""shining them in the eyes"", when I didn't even have a battery loaded.,heres my flexes that my buddy was borrowing.smoke lens on all my goggles son! except my grills, they have a clear lens for night time/cloudy days. ,owning mulitple goggles > changing out lenses,that shit stung,During training one of my soft ears fell off and I got bunkered and shot up all in the temple and ear. That has got to be one of the worst feelings I've ever had. And I've been OCd at 440 point blank.,I got a pretty bad welt on the side of my leg that was there for a week my first time. We were holding a hill, I was personally pinning down like five or six guys. I thought my friend was covering my left flank. Then I got blitzed from that side. , is the pic.,Paintball's got nothing on the pain meter compared to the military version, Simunitions. 9mm plastic, paint-filled bullets fired from a replacement upper for an M4/M16. You're guaranteed to bleed if they hit bare skin, and I was unfortunate enough to find out what getting hit in the tip of the dick feels like.,who needs gloves, most jerseys have thumbholes these days,guy in my first unit got a blue tattoo on his forehead with one of those. Biggest piece of thieving, lying, creepy shit to ever enlist.,He's still in, will probably do 20 years.,'murica.,How? Was his helmet on wrong or something?,Thanks for the suggestions.,http://shop.camelbak.com/impact-ct-,first one,Every other answer is wrong. Maybe not everyone gets them free at work but you can buy boxes of these.,Have fun with that.,wool? nah brah. And its still snowy and cool here.,And I did have fun with that today. There's thinner, more breathable ones for summer. They're grippy as fuck, light and breathable as fuck, and dexterous as all fuck (I just typed this post with them on). Plus they are quite inexpensive.,I mean, they don't offer much protection, though it's much better that bare skin. But don't be a pussy. I get shot in the fingers 7 out of 10 days played. It's not so bad.,I've got bumps grown on my knuckles from sparring with shinai without gauntlets. But choice of gloves is personal, and cheap throwaways aren't for everyone.,My newest order. Too lazy to crop. Dangerous Power G4 - white w/ black accents. Anyone have experience with it?,Use the Snipping Tool instead of Print Screen. It lets you do a drag crop of what's on screen and save it directly as an image. It's under Start>All>Accessories.,Not saying you have to like this choice better, but I can wear 1 pair all season probably. They are only throwaways when you're throwing around heavy, sharp steel plates and tubes all day at work lol.,The highlight of my day was my girlfriend shooting out two guys and both of them screaming, waving their arms around like a wacky waving inflatable arms tube guy.,I've been shot in the hands plenty of times and am certainly not a fan of it, but I just don't like the feel of gloves.,It's not so much getting shot in the hand hurts, it's getting the dirt, paint, and grass all mixed together that fucks with my hands and grip.,I'll say upfront that I have never used a Dangerous Power gun, but I have heard their G series and Fusion line of guns have a serious issue with vibration. Like to the point where extended bursts of fire can rattle screws loose on the marker.,their gas lines also tend to have faulty fittings which leads to leaks,overall i've seen way more DP guns going down on the field than every other brand,Dye gloves are the best gloves if you can get over the price. BT gloves are also good.,http://www.rap4.com/store/paintball,What is the opinion on the new spire hopper, I personally am upgrading too one from my 1st gen rotor in a month or so but I still want some last minute opinions on the hopper itself.,post some pictures nigga. I don't feel like googling that shit right now.,there's a spire torture test on youtube where a guy submerges the whole hopper under water and then cracks some eggs into it and it still works fine. seems like a good choice to me if you need a hopper that can take a beating.,i still rock a viewloader revvy. never even owned a halo or anything else. probably wouldn't work as well as the spire with some eggs in it hahaha,My rotor started jamming, then then the engine just died. I got four years out of it so instead of fixing it I'm deciding just to upgrade.,Holy shit, have you had to replace the shells yet?,God damn, it's been 4 years since that thing came out? I'm getting old. Feels bad, man.,You think that's bad? I don't even follow the sport anymore. I just go out with an old teammate to local speedball places for shits and giggles. I couldn't tell you what the hell a Spire is. Last hopper I bought (and still begrudgingly use) is a VLocity.,i've only had to get a new shell once, about a year after i bought it. i slid into a bunker a bit too hard and slammed my hopper right into it and snapped it off right at the feed neck.,recently i've only been playing once or twice every few months, more if i'm lucky. that's probably the reason it lasted me so long.,What's so special about it...,From what I have heard it is easier to take apart then the rotor. I'm not entirely sure though. Other players I have talked to say it seems to feed better and not jam quite like the rotor, even though my rotor has never jammed.,the rotor is already dirt-simple to take apart,instead of taking 30 seconds it probably takes 20,a friend of mine had some issues with the spire keeping on spinning even though the paint was already fully stacked,also I personally don't like the concept of a g-force sensor,the rotor keeps on spinning until paint is stacked and spring tension is reached, no sensors or fancy electronic sensors that can go down,on the other hand it seems to handle reballs way better than the rotor,which leads to the last point,mine neither with paintballs,I did have some stoppages with reballs though, but they were already used and reused so many times that they kept sticking together,if you want to buy a new hopper there's nothing wrong with the spire,but i don't see the point in switching from a rotor to a spire,dafuq am I writing,should be,These are all reasonable points, but from a tourney stand point it has,That's why, to me, it's a good idea to upgrade to a spire from my four year rotor.,very well,go for it then,whats the best paintball game for pc?,I have a BT TM-7, and was thinking about getting a rip clip as my next hopper. I used to have an Empire Magna, but it broke when I did something stupid. Does anyone here have experience with the rip clip? are there any better alternatives? Should I just get another Magna?,in my town everyone who has owned DP has had a problem with theirs. I wouldnt suggest it.,I don't think there is a wide selection for PC. Most of the good stuff is console exclusive. I do remember enjoying Digital Paintball years ago but I'm pretty sure people stopped playing that long ago.,Does anyone know how to address the issue of blowing the top off your fucking tac-cap every couple of shots? I had a problem where it would blow the top latch open, so I taped it down, then it just started blowing the top piece OFF. I was thinking about getting a feed gate for it. Anyone know if this will work or any other solutions?,I posted in the other thread saying I was thinking about picking up an NT. Now I'm torn between that and a Cyborg RX.,I'm an indecisive faggot.,felt fucking good man,It's been about 2 years for me.,TFW discover a dedicated baller's thread on 4chan.,So, who plays tournament and who's woodsball? Or both?,i'm a rec baller. my main field is north shore paintball in vancouver, but i'll go down to panther once in a while to mix it up. it's just that north shore is like 15 minutes from my house, and it's the first field i ever played at. feels like home, you know?,just picked up an 02 impulse with vision, cricket board, max-flo, and delrin bolt. i've been looking at impulse maintenance websites to learn how to take it apart and care for it. it really is a blast from the past looking at sites from 2004. makes me feel hella old.,i used to have a wgp trilogy autococker, but something happened to the cocking rod. it seems to be stuck inside the velocity adjuster, which sucks ass since i'm stuck shooting at 200fps with no way to change it. i could take it to a tech, but i figure it would cost me more than the gun is worth just to fix it so i ended up grabbing that impulse.,just ordered a new clamping feed neck from ebay because i always have a really hard time taking my hopper off,Can you unscrew it at all? Like, unscrew it a little bit and it gets stuck at some point?,This is my a5. Probably about to pick up a Tiberius Arms T4. The First Strike rounds are a big motivator.,Anyone have any experience with the T4 or First Strike rounds?,Haven't played for almost two years.,I would play with you until I bleed,Where do you live, bro? Doubt it's near me, but you never know.,You could be awesome and give me an x7 or two. Haha. I have a bunch of friends who want to play but don't have markers.,Thanks, there's an old WW2 bunker network on my summer house property, used to play great scenario battles there. ,Sweden :/,awww shit nigga. That is so far. That's a whole other continent.,Are your friends faggots?,No, that is part of the problem.

When I started training everyone kept saying that I should exploit my tai otoshi but I could never, ever got it right on randori so I dropped it and tried shit like harai goshi, uchi mata, seoi, which are easier. But I feel like I owe this shit to myself, to get a great taio.,All shit gi related, man. Thanks to national holidays here I have no dojo until next wednesday.

After training with his gi he carried onto becoming the greatest motherfucker that ever exited. By armbar.,That sounds exactly like BJJ except with the ippon.,pls no,Sambo, maybe. BJJ and the IBJJF are pretty similar to judo and the IJF and they'll turn the sport into shit if the BJJ'er let it. All the guard pulling, berimbolo'ing, refs restarting and shit show how much BJJ'ers let the rules of the sport dictate their martial art.,Don't get me wrong, BJJ is nowhere near the level of stupidty judo got itself into, but it's on its way.,Seconded. I despise what the IJF has done to the sport in recent years. Seriously, competitive Judo has now become a game of poor politics, regulated only by those who think they know best for the sport. ,Some good comments are made on this video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srB,My sensei always tells me that two people in a judo match are like a rubber band, pull on one side, and the other side goes forward (use your brain for the rest of this),To achieve a Tai Otoshi from standing (both opponents postured up with no movement) is very difficult without very precise timing between leg and arm (which is difficult to achieve by just doing fits as opposed to the actual throw),If I ever go for a Tai Otoshi, it's always on people who prefer a bent over/defensive position, people who lean back or keep a good square center of balance are not good targets for this. ,So first try pushing the opponent, making them readjust both legs by using any combination of inner or outer foot sweeps. As they rebound back into you, going against your pull (think rubber band) you want to pull them into your leg for the Tai Otoshi. ,Make sure not to straighten your leg too early, often times people won't have the proper balance and straighten the leg to avoid falling, however, both knees should be bent, and the leg that is tripping should be popped up as their shin meets the back of yours. ,As for the arm motion, a useful strength exercise is cutting wood/using a sledgehammer. Think about the hand on your opponents lapel being below the blade, and the arm being the bottom of the handle, connect the two into a line, and swing downwards. It's a simple idea, but many people try to generate the force of the throw on their leg, as opposed to generating the force through their torso and using the leg to trip the opponent.,Hope this helps.,Start a competing Judo federation?

"I usually don't start threads but figured it might help this board get a permanent spot and I also haven't seen a hula hoop thread (maybe that might be considered an alternative spot?). ,I'll post a few videos of hoopers way better than I am and some tutorials that I found useful, but if you want to ask me any questions let me know. Haven't been hula hooping for long though. ,Here's a few: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LWd,what do you think of the cyr wheel?,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBBy,Just some tutorials:,Hoop smiles has quite a bit even though some are pretty difficult:,http://www.youtube.com/user/hoopsmi,Those look fucking awesome but never tried one. Professional hoops can get expensive, even just adult hoops are about 30 bucks (I'm short and scrawny enough to use a kid's hoops if I duck tape it to add weight. I'm not really sure what those huge one's would cost. ,Not really off topic, it's still a hoop, I don't know anything about them other than what they look like and what tricks people do with them. ,Just looked up how much they would cost and holy shit they are over a 1,000 dollars. Even though I only found it being sold on etsy,,so maybe there's some other sites which are cheaper.,From the sounds of it 1000 bucks is about right. It may be cheaper to have a machine shop make one for you. I'm just an intermediate juggler without any acrobatics training. I couldnt work one of those things if I tried unfortunately. :(,Juggling is fun to watch. Maybe there should be a circus related thread... ,Here's a hula hooping leprechaun: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyXA,fucking zumiez,I can't believe that place is still in business tbh.,its your fault for even walking in there.,b-but i had to ;~;,I was going to try them on there then buy them at another, further away local shop or online.,man are those Herman's sick but with the cost of those I can buy two other pairs,anyways i fucking hate Zumies, everyone shops there, which is the reason why every single local shop ran out of business and shut down,sad, but true.,And the winner is ....... OP,/asp/ can close down now since we've had a perfect thread.,OP wins!!!!,They already have a recurve thread, so can we have a compound thread? ,PSE Nova with carbon express ,Scott Silverhorn release ,Mid-level,Recreational shooter looking to begin competition,Who pissed in your cornflakes? ELB is fun, but a realistic precision tool it is not. An ELB with woodies just can't hit as accurately or as fast as a bottom end compound. Fact. Different strokes for different folks lad.,Not that impressive bro, I can even shoot that on a recurve and I started shooting this september,This,Put you in a wood. Give you a block of stone. Make me a compound. With a decent yew stave I can make a longbow. Maybe. :P,Although I do know what you mean. But I feel a much better connection to a longbow than I ever did to a recurve or compound.,Also, there are plenty of barebow archers who often get 540 on portsmouths, at the UK Uni championships I know someone who was using a wooden, twisted old club bow and shot 475ish barebow..,Ok not to tear you apart guy but... A recurve is just a faster longbow. Unless you get them HEX Border limbs or a Static recurve in which you get even more for your draw. Even a target built recurve is still holding draw weight and releasing an arrow. Compounds are the only different kind of bow. ,Also, 540 portsmouth is hilariously bad, even barebow. I know people who shoot barebow, 560 on a FITA 18. I shoot about 500 barebow on a FITA 18 myself. ,The reason people don't take archery seriously as a sport is the attitude you've displayed just there. YOU don't take it seriously enough, why should an outsider?,Could you call Milsim a sport?,,and why/why not,(what is milsim?: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milsim,And you think that'll continue? HAHAHA,If you only knew her libido...,But besides that, fuck you, Paintball doesn't need pricks like you anyways.,I like to think that Milsim guys are basically combining LARP and Airsoft. While the average guy who plays airsoft is in it just to shoot people and fuck around in a competitive environment, these people enjoy roleplaying while doing that.,I mean fuck, it's better than most fantasy LARP's out there. I'd rather shoot plastic bb's at people than hit them with a foam sword and yell out numbers.,I play scenario games. I prefer them more than speedball.,But i dont do the whole tactical thing.,80 acres. Last game had two teams with 565 people.,We have bases. You have to run to get drop boxes, which have mission cards in them.,Capture and hold missions.,Engineers can ""blow up"" bunkers and kill everyone inside them. and shoot nerf cannons at ""tanks"" (atv's boxed in with wood),Medics have cards with limited number of uses Headshots cant be revived. You have to call MEDIC and not move. They have to run to go help them.,Its plays for 2 days. from 12am to 12pm saturday. and then 9 am to 3pm the sunday with the last hour being everyone put on a small field for a crazy final battle.,I served and i agree that there are some people that take it kinda seriously and fulfill their fantasy of being in the military.,But i just let them be. I don't tell anybody i served. i find people who do that in public are attention whores.,but honestly scenario games are fun. The team work and all the little kids who are SOOO excited to be apart of the team and help out. They love it when the have a responsibility. Like ""cover me"" or ""run and take that base"".,also i might add that it's not airsoft. its paintball.,they have a big game in Texas (near Houston) twice a year.,heres the next one.,http://www.txrpaintball.com/txrs-up,how do I get in to rock climbing? I have no friends, so no spotter or anything,Look for your local bouldering gym and go there. You'll find climbers are some of the friendliest people around and your gym is sure to have some 'get better' or 'increase your level' type of events, you'll meet loads of people super quickly via this.,If you go to an indoor gym, nice ones have autobelayers which require no one to belay you. ,So community rec center or something.,Post your climbing shoes. I'm using Evolv Defy's.,how to start rock climbing:,-find rocks,-climb them,Just find a gym. Take their belay class, meet people. Seriously, rock climbers are really chill and generally friendly. You'll probably meet people who share interests and are also beginners. From there, it's easy as long as you aren't completely socially retarded.,Sup /asp/, let's have a street racing thread. Discuss shifting techniques, cars, etc! ,First question, what's the best technique to launch?!,Usually my strategy is to go faster than the other guy for the entire race.,What cars do you people own? I have a '95 Nissan 300ZX TT. Aztec Red.,I'd say take this to /o/, OP.,Who gets the most pussy in MMA?,My vote is for Chael P. Sonnen,,He's got the biggest arms and the greatest charm.,http://youtu.be/p7wKVOmirkk,I'm getting tried of Silva, the only thing i'd watch from him is a fight with Jones.,If this is a serious question........,If not go back to putting Chael over!,Wont happen. Silva would annihilate Jones in standup, but what use is this when he's lying on his back and eating elbows?,He knows he can't stop Jones' takedowns. And unlike Chael, 'I get submitted in every fourth fight' Sonnen, Jones actually has a decent groundgame beyond 'Punch the other guy and hope he doesn't do jiu jitsu'.,chael sonnen = faggot,speaking of faggots,How to run a successful skate shop? The owner of the only skateshop in my town is barely getting by and his morale seems pretty low, he mite go under. I want to take his place and give it a shot. Anyone have experience? Want advice from past/present owners of skate/snow/surf shop and just small shops in general.,a skate shop is a lot more specialty than a sporting goods store. Sporting goods you have to just cover all your bases.,A skate shop you have to specialize to make the business work, so posting on a board designed to discuss that specific sport (among other things) makes sense.,If I were opening a small specialty clothing store I would consider making a post of /fa/. A gun store, /k/. Hell i'd make a post in /diy/ if I was openning a hardware store. OP is looking for ideas to make a skate shop work. This board is where people interested in skating would go. It makes sense to ask here, its his target demographic,To be honest,I think if the mahority don't have an issue with discussing how would be best to run a Skate shop, then its not an issue.,Its like , said, a skate shop is a lot more personal and specialised than a ganeral sporting goods store,Have a ton of special events with prizes, maybe one or two every month, and you can never advertise too much. At my local shop/park a shit ton of people who even live far away always come.,are you implying that you are going to wait for the local shop to go under and then try your luck at your own shop? if so, you're an idiot and a dick.,first off, why not help the shop owner? if his morale is getting lower its clear that he has put a lot into that shop because he cares about skating and the community, help him out you fucking selfish pig. ,second, if you don't help out and the shop does go under, you're going to have to start from scratch instead of just fixing some things with the other shop to get it back up and running. ,if you are in fact planning to pitch ideas to the store owner with the shop and work with him then that's fine but don't take the mans place.,I work in a store that sells lots of clothes, outside gear and shit, and then there is the shop. It makes it so people can be going in for one thing and decide, hey my fat ass grandchild might like this. That keeps it afloat so you can have the actual skaters come in and check shit out. The big thing is decide how much you let people stand on them and stuff,how do i into skateboarding?,if you don't like it after pushing around for a few minutes or watching others skate(i.e. videos), you probably won't get into it at all.,well you skate around, and then you start to develop a feel for just flinging it into the air,its kind of like an itch that needs to be scratched,and once you get good at doing that you should progress to controlling it in midair,do tricks like ollies, nollies, kickflips, shovs, and then practice late ollies, late nollies, late kickflips, etc.,we have multiple threads about this everyday. just use the cataog.,be a fucking 12 years old,he didn't ask how to into wrestling.,Post the shoes you skate in. Add details about how long they last and how the board feel is.,Vans Era Pro Classics,$50,I love them. Excellent board feel, but they only lasted about two weeks of every day skating (1-3 hour sessions) and lots of flatground before holes went through to my socks. Which is good for Vans in my experience, but I wish they could have gone longer. The rubber around the ollie and toe area lasted a long time though. That extra layer they added to the Pro Classics really helps.,But they're light, comfortable with just enough padding, gel insole, soft sock liner, and they're flexible like Vans Authentics but last longer since they're not canvas.,I might either get these again, go for whatever suede Vans I can find at the outlet, or go all out and buy the DC Mike Mo,Oh I forgot to mention, they wore quicker when I did nollies and heelflips because I drag harder on those tricks. My kickflips and ollies don't drag so hard. I do varial flips wrong, so when I do those I also drag my toe too hard and split my shoes very quickly.,Or maybe I do them right because my toe drags to flip the board as it spins. The board is almost upside down as my front foot kicks out.,These are the shoes that I've been skating, recently got a new pair of DVS that I haven't been able to skate yet. They are Vans Half Cabs, mine are a different color and from the picture I can't tell the exact construction if they are the same or not. They are pretty much dead, soles worn flat after a few months. Good boardfeel, but lacking in the durability department. The shoes are beat to hell, insoles got shredded, beat up in general, but no holes in the leather, only in the tongue so they hold up relatively well visually. Good shoe.,Lakai Manchester Select,super comfy ,feel like you're wearing socks compared to some shoes like Janoskis ,had them for 2+ months and they are still in good condition ,great board feel,like $40,highly recommended,Guys this is my board. I bought it second hand and its seen better days. I'm looking to buy a new one so I need help. I am a beginner and can't do many tricks. I wear a size 8.5 us. Any suggestions,its very old. i wouldnt. are you on an extremely right budget or something?,Yeah...,That has absolutely nothing to do with the brand, that comes down to the size. All brands offer different sizes.,7.75 in. wide deck (maybe 8.0),Indy's (149's would probably fit best),Wheels don't really matter to me, you could probably keep the ones you currently have if they aren't flatspotted. I currently ride a set of DGK wheels i got for free because i subscribed to transworld skateboarding),Bones Reds Bearings,Jessup, Grizzly, or Mob tape.,are you completely retarded?,What is /asp/'s skate setup?,Mine is:,Plan B Shecks 8.25,Thunder High 8.00 trucks,Bones Super Reds,Grizzly Grip Tape,Bone Party Pack STF,Lucky Hardware,Rick Howard Girl 8.5,129 og indies ,mob grip ,bones swiss ,shout out to muska,grip it and rip it,Alien Workshop 8,Thunder Hollow Light highs,Bones STF 52s,Bones Reds,Reflex grip,Enjoi deck 7.5,Santa Cruz sensei bullet trucks,Bones redz bearings,dodo soft bushings,spitfire 50mm wheels,M.O.B griptape,Poplite Deck (8.25) ($17 shipped, i didn't have much money),Indy 159's ,Bones Reds,DGK Wheels (free w/ transworld skate. subscription),Jessup Grip,Shorty's Hardware,It may seem like a piece of shit or just flat-out cheap but its a fun setup,What exactly defines an alternative sport? The absence of points? Of defense? I'm just not sure what the line is.,well wwe isn't because everyone knows who's going to win,i dunno,I always though ""extreme sports"", Sports that don't gather a lot of mainstream coverage, offshoots of mainstram sports etc,I assumed it's for people who want an alternative to most regular sports. Hence why the mods say wrestling fits the bill.,I know it s a long shot but I anyone can do it you guys,What is the martial art that Snake uses in MGS2 ?,From the combos I think its kickbox but you would know better,OP didn't specify ""solid snake"", just ""snake"". Pretty sure it is referred to as CQC in MGS3.,cardboard box,I haven't played MGS4 but from playing MGS3 pathologically/no guns I'd say CQC looks most like a form of aikido/jujitsu (sometimes expressed/taught as aikijujitsu, as they have some overlap). Note: not jujitsu like BJJ, which is mostly about ground game, but traditional japanese jujitsu which in my experience is split equally into joint locks, throws/takedowns, and ground game and blending those into each other.,Think joint locks, countering just about anything an opponent throws at you and using it to knock them to the ground, throws/takedowns, and chokes - you use a ton of these in MGS3, especially the final boss fight, if you're playing the game ""right"".,The MGS wiki says it's similar to judo. Some enemies in the game have lines to the effect of ""I'm tired of your judo"" and ""What is that, some kind of judo?"",he specified mgs2","Hula Hooping,2013 Wilt Chamberlain Award: MMA","03/31/13(Sun)00:28,03/31/13(Sun)00:39,03/31/13(Sun)00:44,03/31/13(Sun)00:52,03/31/13(Sun)00:58,03/31/13(Sun)01:22,03/30/13(Sat)20:47,03/30/13(Sat)21:23,03/30/13(Sat)21:26,03/30/13(Sat)23:41,03/31/13(Sun)00:25,03/31/13(Sun)01:00,03/30/13(Sat)23:47,03/31/13(Sun)00:07,03/31/13(Sun)00:09,03/31/13(Sun)00:58,03/20/13(Wed)21:44,03/27/13(Wed)21:10,03/27/13(Wed)21:58,03/29/13(Fri)09:23,03/29/13(Fri)17:12,03/31/13(Sun)00:35,03/27/13(Wed)22:20,03/30/13(Sat)18:52,03/30/13(Sat)23:07,03/30/13(Sat)23:10,03/30/13(Sat)23:56,03/31/13(Sun)00:02,03/29/13(Fri)15:07,03/29/13(Fri)15:33,03/29/13(Fri)15:44,03/30/13(Sat)16:15,03/30/13(Sat)20:54,03/30/13(Sat)23:35,03/30/13(Sat)21:17,03/30/13(Sat)22:22,03/30/13(Sat)22:30,03/30/13(Sat)23:29,03/30/13(Sat)18:18,03/30/13(Sat)19:02,03/30/13(Sat)19:27,03/30/13(Sat)19:29,03/30/13(Sat)19:29,03/30/13(Sat)22:18,03/28/13(Thu)11:55,03/28/13(Thu)23:03,03/28/13(Thu)23:32,03/28/13(Thu)23:54,03/30/13(Sat)21:52,03/30/13(Sat)21:58,03/30/13(Sat)06:05,03/30/13(Sat)21:08,03/30/13(Sat)21:13,03/30/13(Sat)21:14,03/30/13(Sat)21:27,03/30/13(Sat)21:34,03/29/13(Fri)23:04,03/30/13(Sat)00:04,03/30/13(Sat)00:09,03/30/13(Sat)00:11,03/30/13(Sat)00:22,03/30/13(Sat)21:15,03/30/13(Sat)18:39,03/30/13(Sat)19:24,03/30/13(Sat)19:25,03/30/13(Sat)19:26,03/30/13(Sat)20:43,03/30/13(Sat)20:48,03/30/13(Sat)11:13,03/30/13(Sat)18:19,03/30/13(Sat)18:55,03/30/13(Sat)18:56,03/30/13(Sat)19:10,03/30/13(Sat)20:47,03/30/13(Sat)19:38,03/30/13(Sat)19:54,03/30/13(Sat)20:04,03/30/13(Sat)20:31,03/29/13(Fri)17:23,03/30/13(Sat)19:16,03/30/13(Sat)19:33,03/30/13(Sat)19:56,03/30/13(Sat)20:06,04/01/13(Mon)01:33","Anonymous,Hula Hooping,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Jim Profit,Jim Profit,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,CM Funk , ,03/30/13(Sat)22:22 ,CM Funk,!dGE3Q5Ung6,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,JoeHawksⓌⓄⒷ ⓌⓄⒷ ��(...) , ,03/30/13(Sat)19:33 ,JoeHawksⓌⓄⒷ ⓌⓄⒷ ⓉⒾⓁ ⒹⒺⒶⓉⒽ,!!6SD0R629UW7,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"

And they always remarked that...,I think I closed a kickflip once, and i've successfully closed a boneless down 3 stairs. That's all I've ever been able to do.,Anyway, I think I'll never stop. I don't care if I fall or if I suck, all I want is to skate around. I know I'm ridicolous at skating, that's fine, but anyone else is ridicolous for not skating. It's a wonderful sport, it's an attitude, it's a passion.,Never give up your skateboard. I never did, I'll probably never do, and I couldn't be happier. Maybe someday we'll meet, I'll fall and you'll laugh at me.,You pro dude ?,Not pro, but I am on the team for a couple companies. They're smaller ones you may never heard of, so getting paid is out of the question.

I have been making my own balls lately though. Rice in tennis ball. Tennis ball in balloon. I just made a set that has rice in them and they're pretty heavy. ,One would assume you just find or make heavier and heavier balls. bigger kids balls are pretty easy to find at walmart.

So which mystical eastern arts train you for the realities of combat? Fucking none of them any moreso than 'western' ones. The split, like the traditional/sport one is non-existant. That said, whats more important than your style is the quality ofyour training. Focus on finding a gym that is compotent first, before thinking about anything else,Sure, theres currently two threads on this board, just ask away.,I would recommend boxing. Punching is pretty much the foundation of unarmed combat, and there's nothing better for it than boxing. You'll also be focusing on only one thing instead of learning a million things at once. I think once you've got a good grasp of boxing you could consider taking up Muay Thai, kickboxing or Kyokushin as well, if you want to learn kicks.,For grappling, either BJJ or Judo. They're both derived from Jiujitsu, but BJJ emphasizes ground grappling while Judo emphasizes grappling from a standing position. I think overall BJJ might be better.,No matter what martial art you're doing, you can always get better.,Seems legit,http://chattanooga.craigslist.org/s,Has anyone else on /asp/ done crew/rowing?

Are bigger wheels better for tranny?,yes anon, just get big wheels.,Imagine how the wrestling world would be rocked if Taker/Sting planned that shit out and executed it in the main event of WWE's biggest event of the year with millions watching.,It would literally be the swerve needed to bring TNA to glory and compete legit with WWE.,My dick would explode.,Oh wow you guys packed this thread.,NEW THREAD,NEW THREAD,NEW THREAD,NEW THREAD,NEW THREAD,NEW THREAD,NEW THREAD,NEW THREAD,//,what kind of lines do you have?,wich style is your preferred?,how often do you go/train?,I had a 25mm austri alpin line, but i've fucked it up and completely core shot it. austri-alpin since stopped making their awesome longline extensions, so i've swapped to elephant blue wing, which should arrive in the mail soon.,Generally I do tree-tree short high lines. My next project is to walk between the arches underneath this bridge, I've already done a test climb and now i'm just waiting for my new line. http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/F,I wanna get into this, can you point me in the direction of lines/info videos OP?,Check out NWslacklining. It's ran by one of the smartest and safest slackliners there. (NWslackline.org),If there is a local climbing store or outdoors store, go there and get this:,4 Blackdiamond oval carabiners ($6ish dollars each),2 one inch belay rings. Single chain links do the job too.,60ft of one inch (25mm) tubular climb/mil/slack spec webbing (any of those will due),two 15ft of webbing, REI sells 30ft pieces cheaper than by the foot. Or you can buy 90ft total and cut it into 15ft, 15ft, and 60ft segments, make sure to melt the ends.,Check out this video for explanation on how to rig it! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdDz,here a nice docu about Dean Potter,highliner, multi-pitch/free solo climber,http://youtu.be/IsagruTOXA8,Gear:,1x15m, Gibbon 50mm line,1x20m, Pure 25mm line,Low lining between trees mainly.

Normally around this time I get real excited for at least one match on the show but not this year. Maybe it's because every major match is a rematch or maybe it's just poorly booked is anyone in the same boat with me? I mean not even Taker Vs Punk is enough to get me to buy this show.,have some cutty spaghetti bro.,fuckin straightedge faggot get the fuck off my 4chan,dude, this is wrestlemania, you can expect the midcard belts to be a little off the spotlight.,show me your epic shots, any sport. ill start with a couple.,used to ride for neversummer, 686 and Board Room. Also snowboard general thread, ask me anything.,the big line at keystone is no fucking joke. it is designed by skiers so the speed line required a bit of a b-line to get speed. work up to twenties and thirties man, decking those isnt shit if you have some legs under you. also you can get some spins out clean off them. big jumps are fuckin scary till you hit them. just make sure when you get to that size that you are clear of the knuckle. even if you land on your head, if you are on the landing tranny you arent going to get too fucked up.,About an hour north of my hometown there is this indoor slope. I went there once with a few friends. There was a kicker at the end of the slope, and it was so badly designed that it was impossible for my slender 16-year-old self to make it over the flat. Even if I skipped everything on the whole slope and just went straight for the jump I didn't make it. Made me rage pretty hard.,take a vacay to colorado. next season of course... but holy shit we know how to make jumps out here. a good speed line is critical so you can make a nice s-curve between jumps and get your spin/invert on. unless you are being a fucking crazy bastard, always spin frontside off your heel edge and backside off your toe edge. a good s-curve maintaining speed to do so is critical.,Never saw such an s-curve, but I guess what you said doesn't matter that much on those smaller jumps. Anyway, I need to get some sleep to get up early, yurop time. Let's hope this board stays and doesn't get completely overrun by WWE fags.,cheers /b/ro. keep shreddin.","Skateboarding,Wrestling General [Please Don't Make Us Watch Shimmer Again Edition]","03/31/13(Sun)17:38,03/31/13(Sun)18:12,03/31/13(Sun)18:53,03/31/13(Sun)23:57,03/31/13(Sun)16:09,03/31/13(Sun)23:32,03/31/13(Sun)22:59,03/31/13(Sun)23:09,03/31/13(Sun)23:14,03/31/13(Sun)23:02,03/28/13(Thu)22:58,03/31/13(Sun)22:26,03/31/13(Sun)22:30,03/31/13(Sun)22:31,03/31/13(Sun)22:39,03/31/13(Sun)22:40,03/31/13(Sun)17:13,03/31/13(Sun)18:57,03/31/13(Sun)19:07,03/31/13(Sun)20:43,03/31/13(Sun)21:54,03/31/13(Sun)21:59,03/29/13(Fri)14:19,03/29/13(Fri)20:00,03/31/13(Sun)03:59,03/31/13(Sun)04:05,03/31/13(Sun)04:41,03/31/13(Sun)21:49,03/31/13(Sun)21:30,03/31/13(Sun)21:49,03/31/13(Sun)07:17,03/31/13(Sun)10:49,03/31/13(Sun)10:50,03/31/13(Sun)11:17,03/31/13(Sun)11:57,03/31/13(Sun)21:27,03/31/13(Sun)21:10,03/31/13(Sun)21:15,03/31/13(Sun)21:18,03/31/13(Sun)10:08,03/31/13(Sun)11:26,03/31/13(Sun)18:56,03/31/13(Sun)21:01,03/31/13(Sun)21:11,03/31/13(Sun)05:51,03/31/13(Sun)23:22,04/01/13(Mon)00:37,04/01/13(Mon)00:37,04/01/13(Mon)00:42,04/01/13(Mon)00:54,03/25/13(Mon)05:19,03/27/13(Wed)05:11,03/29/13(Fri)09:28,03/29/13(Fri)20:22,03/31/13(Sun)05:23,03/31/13(Sun)20:38,03/30/13(Sat)00:39,03/31/13(Sun)14:12,03/31/13(Sun)14:18,03/31/13(Sun)14:19,03/31/13(Sun)20:16,03/31/13(Sun)20:21,03/29/13(Fri)19:23,03/31/13(Sun)16:40,03/31/13(Sun)16:50,03/31/13(Sun)16:55,03/31/13(Sun)17:07,03/31/13(Sun)19:54","Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,OP,OP,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Skateboarding,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Vincent Gayda McMeter , ,03/31/13(Sun)04:05 ,Vincent Gayda McMeter,!!UYVhB1c0DF5,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Mike_Singletary , ,03/31/13(Sun)21:27 ,Mike_Singletary,!!PFWjIRTJ/YU,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Carter,The Internet , ,03/31/13(Sun)05:51 ,Carter,The Internet,!!GJY1FUx1QHe,Anonymous,Anonymous,Vincent Gayda McMeter , ,04/01/13(Mon)00:37 ,Vincent Gayda McMeter,!!UYVhB1c0DF5,Carter,The Internet , ,04/01/13(Mon)00:37 ,Carter,The Internet,!!GJY1FUx1QHe,Carter,The Internet , ,04/01/13(Mon)00:42 ,Carter,The Internet,!!GJY1FUx1QHe,Highline - Slackline - Trickli(...),Highline - Slackline - Trickline - Rodeoline General Thread,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,noko,noko,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"

I happen to live and play in the same city of a big prodigy player. I'm def skeptical.,I have this to say about Prodigy; I really think they should have gone about their PR a little different and let the internet do most of the hyping instead of doing it themselves. That being said, they are making improvements. As with any manufacturer, they are still learning and testing so I would try the discs before throwing out the ban hammer. ,The D1 and D4 are great drivers IMO. Go with the First Runs obviously. People get upset when the Protos don't fly like they think it should. It is called a Prototype for a reason.... ,I can't wait to try the putters and fairway drivers. Those are my favorites anyways. I have a source (sounds lame I know) that says at least one of the putters is going to be very Gateway Magic like. I think that is a great move. If they make it in their current plastic, I will be very pleased. ,So, overall, they a ways to go. They are new and just want to survive, but they still could have done better. I love the feel of their plastic and I have played with Phil Arthur enough times to know he really cares about the products but is just very new to this aspect of the game.

I figured: I had an hour to kill one day, so I decided to rent a board. Pretty soon I was addicted. After a few sessions, I no longer drop the sail ever ten seconds, and can sail comfortably at a speed of about fifteen mph.,I had no formal training, but I figured out the mechanics of turning and whatnot pretty fast. My one question is where exactly on the board you are supposed to stand. I reasoned that you stand on the opposite end to the board to where you tilt your sail, i.e if you tilt your sail to the back to turn into the wind, you should stand nearer to the front of the board, since that will ease pressure on the back, correct?,usually less than sailing boats.,most windsurf boards don't have swords,Woho!,To gain the most speed and the most fun (and get onto planning speeds) try to place your feet and your weight so that the board is flat - both forwards and sideways.,Start using a harness early, as soon as you can stand for longer periods on the board - get a harness.

"So guys what do you think of gliding? do you consider it an alternative sport?,what i do: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SA-,Meh, formation flying through loops and such would be just as fun...,How costly is a glider licence?,It depends on the place where you do it and how good you are at it. I got my license for 36 000 czech crowns (which is about 1400 euros). After the basic training, it is relatively cheap (the better you are, the cheaper it gets),do you fly competitively?,Yes, I do.,I'll look into it once I move out... This stuff is the cheapest I can get into flying without it being something completely boring.,Hey /asp/, not from around these parts. I'm just ignorant and pussy about these matters so sorry if this is stupider than I thought.,What's a good sport for getting your aggression out with minimal damage to your body?,I'm pretty fucking tiny, I need to let out steam, and I'll get wrecked so I'm trying to avoid any painful martial arts (i.e. muay thai) for now. Is there a stream of boxing I can get into that doesn't mean I'd be bleeding from my mouth? I think some sort of boxing would be good. Is it bad to just purchase a punching bag and punch away? I'm worried that would lead to problems with improper technique (and if there's a punching bag, I may as well be learning something, right?),Slacklining Bro.,Just go and do Muay Thai. Some people just go there to be fit, others to fight. Either way there's a lot of (padded) sparring and most people respect the pace you want to go at. ,Also Thai's are pretty small, and they're monsters when they fight.,Swimming.,Hey OP, I get what you're talking about and here is what I think.,If you're looking to defend yourself, I second the running suggestion. I'm a girl, I did a lot of being sleeping outside and travelling on the rough in my teens, and running saved my ass countless times. Self-defense classes are a good idea too. I wouldn't recommend getting weapons unless you know how to use them and the legality where you live. They can be turned against you and knife fights are nothing like you see in movies.,When I started fighting I was also worried about getting hit but when you started it's much different. Depending on class size you may be paired up with people your own size. Most bigger classmates I've had where also good at controlling their strength while sparring. Some gyms have different methods than others so find the right one and you'll be set, as many try to make it a more sportsy and fun thing than a free-for-all fight club. You will also learn how to not get hit. The bruises and ocasional injuries are part of the fun in my experience.,You should keep in mind that most styles that let you ""blow off steam"" by punching shit place a lot of emphasis on strength and contact so you'll definitely get hit back. Those that don't place an even stronger emphasis on technique, so be prepared to spend hours and hours refining your moves.,I would recommend tae kwon do for you. If you still think that's too aggressive, you can try some ""fitness kickboxing"" stuff, the kind that is like aerobics combined with kicking and punching. That puts less emphasis on fighting so if you're just looking for a way to blow off steam and have fun that could be for you.,moshing,Does anyone know the names of the fighters? Or the name of the event? I'm trying to find a video of this submission. I use it frequently in judo.,Also, MMA thread, i guess.,its not a choke its an armbar/should lock,It's a modified Kesa Gatame (scarf hold) with a kimora, often times you just release the head when you can get the arm lock, but he just used his legs instead.,yes it is. i derped and said choke.,it is a figure 4/americano and not a kimura,no,yes,It's called Ashi Gatame in judo.,Downhill Skateboarding Thread!,please don't post kooky 12 yr old loaded fanboys,spotters, and find a single turn and practice your predirfts, it can make staying in your lane easier. ,personal experience: if you see your spotter throw a X, dont second guess. Just shut 'er down right away.,relax. your body is going to want to fight you on this one. but all you have to do is relax.,second, learn how to stop from any speed safely. be it sliding or footbreaking, just fucking stop when you need to.,third, look as far ahead as possible. dont look down at the ground right in front of you, youre already there. dont look at your foot positioning, just be comfortable in your stance.,fourth, look in the direction you want to turn, it seems basic, but a lot of people miss this. they force their ankles to do the work and they over correct often. when you look where you want to to, your head will turn, then shoulders, hips, and so on. like everytime youve had a stupid crash, its because you were looking at what you dont want to hit, and why happens? you fuckin hit it.,that's Patrick Switzer and he knows what the fuck he is doing, you on the other hand sound like an idiot right now.,bumpity bump bump,As a different way of bumping, I'll post my downhill set up :,-Fullbag TM-FR ,-Paris 180 (Riptide 90a APS Magnum boardside, 90a APS Canon roadside, flat amish washers all around),-Many different wheels. I'll stick with 78a Radvantages for a while.,Surely there are other people on this website who like Motocross/Supercross, right?,Recently tore my ACL and medial meniscus riding.11' CRF450R. Cams, high comp piston, race gas tune, FI mods, ecu tune, FMF exhaust header to slip on, had the rake changed, A60 with carbon hubs, MX51's, 13/48, Protaper S/E windham bend, kevlar grips. Just threw a fresh top end in the old bird. I was rooting for Barcia even though he was a rookie but he did well for his rookie season with all the competition.,ACL? Fuck that noise. Nice bike though - I don't think I could ever tap the power of a 250 2T or 450F.,We recently got a 2 stroke only class again in N.I. and it's awesome, a few really quick guys who are constantly on the pipe.,http://vimeo.com/62202422,The ACL wasn't even the worst part of the injury surprisingly. 2 strokes are so much fun to ride. I wish I had a 125 lying around to play with. 250's are hard to keep on the pipe because that powerband is so god damn violent.,I do ride in sandy areas so the 450 is needed to be competitive. I know for a fact if I had some nice clay to dig into I'd rip my arms out of their sockets. I'm thinking about getting some head work done and some kibble white valves.,If you have a small to medium sized track 125s are great. I had a ride on a CR250 the other day on a small track, and right through every gear all the front end wanted to do was lift, all the low down power just trying to throw you off the back, it was awesome.,Can't beat a good sand track every now and then. Just stick it into the corners and make your own berms,does /asp/ have any tips for homemade sliding gloves? My landyachtz pair broke, and i don't want to pull money out of my ass for another pair.,I just can't get those coleman slides w/o gloves; it fucks up my hands!,pic related-me and my bitch,globe sucks moldy cock. go with a bombsqad or earth wig deck, get some good quality trucks, preferably caliber or paris (i have a pair of bears that are ok) and get some metro motion wheels.,Construction gloves. Heavy-duty adhesive velcro. A cutting board. ,You can even change the pucks when they're finished. It's glorious.,Oh, make sure you put the palm puck closer to the wrist.,I love this board.,well, i got a lot of feedback, and thank you. I pieced everything together and came up with this:,industrial work gloves,old sliding pucks,velcro,shoe glue,thanks!,Ok so I train in Muay Thai. If I wanted to punch and kick harder, do I just kick more or would weights/machines do anything?,also martial arts thread,This post will look like shit i think,no we didn't,even if you're a world champion, it's not a good idea to go above 2 lbs, let alone 5 kg. If you go higher than 2 lbs, you'll get slower long term because your muscle fibers will learn to twitch slowly.,you have ZERO idea how to train,op needs to lift explosively and follow linear periodization, not this unsupported broscience ancecdotal evidence bullshit,Been doing some extra bag work after training, maybe 5 or 6 rounds, noticed slight increase in muscle and vein bulge,While they aren't as fast as sprinters, that doesn't mean they're slow. They are quicker at running than anybody who isn't a sprinter because of their light weight and speediness. Long-distance runners can also sprint for a longer time than thier counter-parrts.,thoughts?,Rather good I suppose if you're an athlete anyway, but I reckon you'd be inefficient compared to someone who does. A bit like a car with too much horsepower and no grip, that runs out of gas quick. Or maybe like the difference between an expierenced driver and a beginner. I'm saying, a good race driver might be able to compentsate a mediocre car with his skills.,bump,Each has had their own method of training, both of them shine in different aspects.,every so often /b/ has a running thread and I end up finding out it's guys I've raced before.,this. I could sprint for shit moved down to the 400 hit 51 indoor and 200 23 indoor,Sup /asp/, this *is* the proper board for skiing and snowboarding, right? It's not really /sp/ material, yet I haven't seen ANY posts in here about skiing or snowboarding. Let's change that. It's still pretty cold up north, the season ain't over yet.,Seriously, I can't express how shocked I am that there are literally NO skiing or snowboarding threads here, yet piles of fucking WWE threads. ,Anyways, some questions to get the ball rolling:,1. Ski or board?,2. Where do you shred?,3. How many years of experience do ya have?,1. ski,2. Ohio, and it fucking blows. Go up to NY (Peek n Peak usually) whenever I can, though.,3. 12+ years on skis. Been boarding a few times, though.,You might want to try Zermatt, the highest lift goes up to 3900m, but the ""slopes"" up on the glacier are probably not worth the effort.,also,1)Board,2)Alps. Don't have a regular place, since I'm from northern germany and can only go there on holidays. Favourite places of mine are Ischgl and Skiwelt Wilder Kaiser Brixental.,3)7 years. Before that 10 years of skiing.,I ride a NITRO Rook, twin shape, flatline profile.,I'm mad jelly, do you get paid to ride?,There's a glacier in Tignes/Val d'Isere but it was sketchy at best when I was there, especially for the boarders.,Yeah, the front range provides a bit of a misrepresentation of Colorado riding/ skiing. ,Pfffft,Hintertux Glacier is nice in summer. Has a good park, too.,1- ski,2- CO,3- 20+ (ski very few days a year however),http://youtu.be/IGDkPKw2FWg,old thread ,who has some fun lined up for april?,i'm going to pinnacles, yosemite (twice) and gonna do some dws in hawaii.,Never seen it broken down like this, but it makes sense. I'm tall and built (former lifter who refuses to try to lose mass), and overhanging crimpy routes just destroy me, but anything with pinches/slopers and not too overhung is my jam. Also, compression problems make me happy.,since questions like ,get often asked i try to give an answer to my best knowlege,those advices are more&less for beginners:,its my opinion that specific training isnt necessary till the climber/body has reached a certain level. however also in the beginning you can have produktive or contraproduktive sessions in the gym.,heres how a session should look like:,15mn+ proper warm-up on big holds, traverses or very easy routes (prevents injuries, gets your system ready),2h+ hard stuff: try to climb/train/boulder as hard as possible but also have just fun and enjoy trying hard things (this is the power training part of your session),30mn of climbing rounds or routes again on big holds (also prevents injuries,muscel sores, helps to recover faster and trains your stamina),it is very important not to get pumped forearms cause it prevents you from training at your maximum. if the warm up gets you pumped then climb easier!,As a beginner myself, the advice I was given was: Above all, get comfy shoes.,I got a pair of La Sportiva Mythos. They're leather, and of all the 6 different shoes I tried on, they were the most comfortable. Later, I have seen them being recommended as good beginners shoes.,imo what pushes mythos away from being beginner shoes is their cost. $150 is a hefty commitment for someone just getting into climbing (especially since they also need a harness, chalkbag and atc all at the same time, which is, at minimum, another $100).,that being said, my wife's first shoes were a pair of mythos.,Just got myself a pair of tenaya ras! Cant wait to try them out at my gym in nc,General skateboard thread,,post and discuss setups,most impressive trick you can do,loose vs tight,street, vert or freestyle etc...,whats wrong spitfire and reds?,I picked up a Plan B the day before yesterday on sale for 30 bux with grip, skated it today, it's pretty chill,pic of deck?,looks nice,any of you asp/ies fence at all?,which weapon do you use?,favourite techniques?,any cool stories?,general fencing discussion,What's a light, stiff, and not too expensive epee blade?,When its broken, replace it.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLsv,I was at a college competition last weekend where one of my teammates had to rush off the piste to puke. The ref didn't know what was going on. He wasn't sure if he should laugh or throw a card.,Was it an interversaty match? That's typically where puking on pistes stems from..,Carlsen has a roughly equal position against Svidler, while Kramnik might be in trouble against Ivanchuk.,Even though they share the first place, Carlsen only needs to match Kramnik's result to win the tournament because of the way the tiebreaks work.,Lrn2alt sports,http://www.youtube.com/watch?nomobi,Does /asp/ unicycle?,I occasionally ride a shitty 20"" torker.,Buddy of mine has a couple of fat tire 20""s, a 30"", and a 5ft so we screw around on those sometimes.,Do you ride trials or street?,How can I learn to dance?,I mean this guy did it:,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKNh,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py5q,Don't,Hunt this man down, become his apprentice.,Problem solved.,Depends on what kind of dance you want to learn. If anything hiphop related you can teach yourself through vids some kind of basics and when you feel comfortable enough go follow classes, really do.,If anything classical, modern or jazz wants to be learned, just go follow classes.","Gliding,Downhill Skateboarding,Are long-distance runners really bad at sprinting?,Skiing & Snowboarding General,where muh climberbros at?,Skateboard General,2013 Candidates Tournament LAST ROUND,unicycle football","04/01/13(Mon)09:40,04/01/13(Mon)10:21,04/01/13(Mon)10:26,04/01/13(Mon)11:17,04/01/13(Mon)11:54,04/01/13(Mon)15:41,03/28/13(Thu)23:33,03/31/13(Sun)12:06,03/31/13(Sun)20:42,03/31/13(Sun)20:45,04/01/13(Mon)15:10,04/01/13(Mon)15:22,04/01/13(Mon)12:37,04/01/13(Mon)13:07,04/01/13(Mon)13:14,04/01/13(Mon)13:20,04/01/13(Mon)13:36,04/01/13(Mon)15:04,03/24/13(Sun)12:12,03/29/13(Fri)01:01,03/29/13(Fri)01:04,03/30/13(Sat)21:38,03/31/13(Sun)20:06,04/01/13(Mon)14:38,03/27/13(Wed)10:47,03/31/13(Sun)02:29,03/31/13(Sun)11:20,03/31/13(Sun)15:48,03/31/13(Sun)16:20,04/01/13(Mon)14:15,03/29/13(Fri)15:16,03/30/13(Sat)23:32,03/31/13(Sun)01:46,03/31/13(Sun)01:47,03/31/13(Sun)15:27,04/01/13(Mon)13:53,03/28/13(Thu)13:09,04/01/13(Mon)08:15,04/01/13(Mon)13:33,04/01/13(Mon)13:38,04/01/13(Mon)13:42,04/01/13(Mon)13:42,03/31/13(Sun)21:32,04/01/13(Mon)05:21,04/01/13(Mon)09:28,04/01/13(Mon)09:38,04/01/13(Mon)13:01,04/01/13(Mon)13:02,03/27/13(Wed)02:23,03/31/13(Sun)15:22,03/31/13(Sun)16:02,04/01/13(Mon)08:41,04/01/13(Mon)09:39,04/01/13(Mon)12:59,03/27/13(Wed)00:47,03/31/13(Sun)01:24,03/31/13(Sun)05:09,03/31/13(Sun)05:23,03/31/13(Sun)22:04,04/01/13(Mon)11:36,03/25/13(Mon)16:32,03/31/13(Sun)18:41,03/31/13(Sun)18:54,03/31/13(Sun)19:06,03/31/13(Sun)19:23,04/01/13(Mon)11:19,03/31/13(Sun)22:05,04/01/13(Mon)00:31,04/01/13(Mon)06:44,04/01/13(Mon)07:03,04/01/13(Mon)10:37,04/01/13(Mon)10:51,04/01/13(Mon)10:48,03/29/13(Fri)10:14,03/30/13(Sat)15:57,03/31/13(Sun)15:03,03/31/13(Sun)19:45,03/31/13(Sun)20:06,04/01/13(Mon)10:18,03/30/13(Sat)08:34,03/31/13(Sun)02:31,03/31/13(Sun)02:35,03/31/13(Sun)02:41,04/01/13(Mon)00:02,04/01/13(Mon)08:18","Anonymous,Gliding,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Harper,Harper,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Downhill Skateboarding,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,where muh climberbros at?,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,OP,Skateboard General,OP,Anonymous,Anonymous,ThreaKlller , ,03/31/13(Sun)18:54 ,ThreaKlller,!H1HTK6APw.,Anonymous,Anonymous,ThreaKlller , ,03/31/13(Sun)19:23 ,ThreaKlller,!H1HTK6APw.,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Irishfag,Irishfag,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,corporal punishment,unicycle football,corporal punishment,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"
"Can we get a Kung Fu thread going?,There's MMA and Boxing, as well as Krav Maga, but I see no Kung Fu!,A real martial artist is proficient in both fighting techniques as well as the beautiful, artistic side of their art! Where most karate and tae kwon do schools fall short is their artistic merit -- when they begin to spar, they forget their teachings and resort to mere kickboxing techniques!,Know this: a good fighter and a good martial artist are two different things. The fighter will win a fight, yes -- but the martial artist will win a fight with grace and beauty as well as tenacity!,Forms are the nucleus of the system yes, but that's doesnt translate to efficacy. Examples: most animals styles of Kung fu fall short because they imitate animal movements rather than choosing the most effective way that the human body works.,What?,Yes, but that's where fighting style comes from. Sure, there is probably a most technically effective set of fighting moves that can be used. That's not the point. If I want the most effective, I'll buy a gun.,A good martial artist will win most effectively, and save all the 'grace' for when him and his friends are circle jerking each other in their McDojo.,So, a good martial artist will just buy a handgun and carry it with him. Nowadays, guns are common enough to make that realistic. What's the point in even learning a martial art? You're not doing it for the sake of the art, you're not doing it for the sake of pushing your body. You're doing it to win in a life-or-death fight. So buy a gun. It's a lot cheaper than learning a martial art. It's a lot more efficient than learning a martial art.,Dagorhir/Belegarth, are they /asp/?,It's about as popular than shooting plastic bb's at each other from overpriced toys while dressed up as real military units.,That doesn't make it any better, does it?,Do you always answer questions with another question?,Nope, thats you.,That's myself and a friend facing down an attacking group back in 2009 I believe. That's only a small section of the field, there were over six hundred fighters thg day. It's a fucking rush!,Anyone actually contemplating buying Wrestlemania?,Most of the card looks like ass but there are some matches I expect to be fucking fantastic and am extremely excited. I hope WWE goes all out since it's mania and dont want to watch that on some shitty low res stream...,But fuck WWE and fuck that overpriced shit.,What to do,Buy it? Pfft. I'll wait until about 2 hours (or less, depends on uploaders) and download a HD rip.,Just got to avoid Facebook, Twitter, This Place, and anywhere else in case of spoilas.,The idea is they put on a good product I'm willing to pay for then I give them money not I give them money and then they maybe put on a good show,Only HHH and Lesnar is worth watching. And HHH is going to win so even that is going to be a bore fest.,pleb,Ordering it with the help of some friends and watching it on my glorious 107"" HD Projector screen while niggas in my neighborhood drive by all jelly they aren't allowed inside.,Seriously though, I know the card kinda sucks, and it's super predictable, but it's kind of a ritual me and some bros have to watch PPVs, especially Wrestlemania. The show is always more enjoyable with banter included (whether it be from 4chan, or your RL bros).,Bulletball (and Bulletball exXxtreme) General,Are YOU high intensity?,I shiggy diggy doo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNb,This is one of the funniest things i've seen in a long time,bump,Who /kabbadi/ here?,I just read the rules of this, all of my what!?!,We use to get segmants or the odd game on C4, I barely remember it as I was about 6 but the chanting chain tag styles always stayed with me, looked fun to play.,Oh here we go, via the wiki. ,post your bikes,Guess who gets to ride again finally!

Skate talk I guess, sorry if there already is one but I didn't go past the front page,Natural ntroverts skate the best. No distractions.,I feel you. I'm in pretty much the same position as you probably are. In our skatepark there is always just one other guy that is pretty good (was sponsered by fallen before he had a car accident and his brother got killed in it). Now he's sponsered by a skateshop in the next town because we live in a shithole. Well I have a couple of friends that used to skate for a bit, but now I am the only one that's still into it. I'm not that good but that doesn't bother me since I have fun doing it. I just wish we had decent street spots or a nice park.,I skated constantly growing up and I'm just getting back in touch with it at 25. I'm not great but I'm already making faster progress than I used to, better resources online and after spending time messing around with flatland bmx, aggressive inline, bboying and even scooters for a hot bored minute I have a much better perspective on how to approach and practice new tricks. I used to find myself getting really demoralized before but now I understand better how to see what I do wrong and adjust to actually move ahead as opposed to repeating the same errors.,I never really had anyone to skate with as a kid and I still don't now. Just do it because I love it. All the other stuff I tried was pretty fun while it lasted but I dunno, coming back to skateboarding just sort of feels right.,So, I have a black belt in Tae Kwon Do and I'm a newfag at brazilian jiu jitsu, and did wrestling in high school. I don't practice TKD anymore, though.,I want to learn more about how to fight while standing up. What I know from Tae Kwon Do just isn't that helpful, and I want to get into more MMA type stuff.,The gym I'm currently at offers both Muay Thai and Jeet Kune Do classes. Which one is more useful for fighting and MMA type competitions?,As far as advice I would offer:,Tae Kwon Do is nice for people who want a very traditional martial art with memorized forms and more traditional elements like philosophy and lots of bowing. Go to a World TaeKwonDo Federation studio, though, it's the kind they do in the Olympics. They do full contact sparring (with pads), so you actually learn somewhat useful skills. The no-contact ITF does is lame.,BJJ: BJJ is a great sport for people who want to learn how to grapple. A lot like wrestling, but going to submission instead of pin. The community is usually pretty good and friendly and very helpful. ,Wrestling is a good choice if you're in high school or college because it's easy to access. It's an amazing workout and you will get very fit. The skills aren't totally applicable to a fight but it's a great sport for sports sake.,I'm here to answer questions about these sports if you want me to answer them from what I know.,JKD isn't a martial style in the truest sense, and varies wildly from practitioner to practitioner due to the personal, individual approach that it takes. Certain versions of it certainly contain Muay Thai, but it isn't nearly the same thing.,OP, have you considered Aikido? Assuming you've got access to a decent club, it sounds like it'd be right up your alley. Though there are some weapons (""aikido bats"", as our sensei would call them while MCing a demo), and quite a bit of suwariwaza (techniques done from sitting on your knees and feet), most aikido practice happens standing up and resembles wrestling in that there's grabs and such going on.,Seeing as you've already got an idea of how to punch and kick, you'd have a (tiny bit of) leg up.,Very little throwing up in aikido, too. No cup, no tooth guard, no adversarial practice or competition. Highest proportion of women in a martial art (i.e. not counting things like self-defense classes). Once you've got safe falling down you can start training more dynamically, which looks super badass on Youtube.,He says he wants to compete, so a martial art that has been stripped of its martial ability through watered down training isn't the best bet. Training should be hard dude, if you aren't conditioned then how the hell are you going to pull off this stuff against resisting opponents? Even Osensei was like in crazy good shape.,Eh, true, there's no competition in Aikido. Missed that bit.,Dunno really, I've found that the curret form of aikido training permits levels of strength that'd be dangerous with things like kicks and locks on the spine, as done in a fair many other MAs. Admittedly it looks fake as fuck, and when I was practicing with someone of my own (n00bly, 4. kyu) level it also felt fake as fuck, but then trying to not cooperate with a 2. dan I realized that it's totally not fake. (Also the wrist locks, arm turns, and especially the elbow locks genuinely hurt. They're not difficult to do either, practically a staple of all ju-jitsu.),Anyway, the way to pull off aikido against resisting opponents is to use more strength, or ideally, better timing. Or if the opponent doesn't know what's good for him/her, punches to the face: there's a lot of implied fisting involved. Some substyles make a point of showing every punch, but more traditional mainstream Aikido seemed to deprecate punches almost to the point of non-involvement.,I can definitely see Aikido not being for everyone. There's little room for huffing and puffing and punching a sack to become tougher and harder.,There are no shortcuts, the huffing and puffing is needed. ,It doesn't teach you to do it on a resisting opponent...,Stand-up grappling is about positioning and weight distribution, the throws in Aikido come primarily from the hips, you shouldn't need strength. The reason you use it is because youre used to do the techniques under ideal conditions, not when someone is flailing around and fucling you up. Its what happens when you don't train live.,Haha, yes. But in all seriousness, you can't just imply strikes, you have to drill them until they become reflex or otherwise you won't react in time.,Aikido has some up-shots, it teaches you how to feel your opponents intent and weight distribution through touch, it also has fantastoc training for breakfalls and rolls. Its unfortunate, it started off pretty cool in the '50s.,Do you guys know of any way i could build a side-by-side double barrel shotgun for air soft that would fire the rounds used in airsoft grenade launchers?,Snooker is played using a cue and 22 snooker balls: one white cue ball, 15 red balls worth one point each, and six balls of different colours: yellow (2 points), green (3), brown (4), blue (5), pink (6) and black (7). Whenever a red ball is potted, the shooter is allowed to pot one of the colours. If successful, they score the value of the colour potted, and it is returned to its correct position on the table. This process continues until they fail to pot the desired ball, at which point their opponent comes back to the table to play the next shot. The game continues in this manner until all the reds are potted and only the 6 colours are left on the table; at that point the colours must be potted in the order from least to most valued ball - that is, yellow first (because smallest value of 2 points), then green (3 points), brown (4 points), blue (5 points), pink (6 points) and finally black (7 points), with the balls not being returned to play. When the final ball is potted, the player with more points wins. Maximum score is 147, if you pot red-black-red-black (and so on) and clean up other colors from the table. A regular (full-size) table is 12 × 6 ft (3.7 × 1.8 m). Snooker is primarily a game of controlling the cue ball. Everything rests on good positioning for the next shot.,Some of the more famous players are: Stephen Hendry, Ronnie O'Sullivan, Steve Davis, Jimmy White, John Higgins, Mark Williams, Ray Reardon, Alex Higgins...,Most proficient tournament winner is Hendry, with 36 titles, followed by Davis (28), Higgins (25) and O'Sullivan (24). O'Sullivan is usually praised as the most ""naturally gifted"" player ever, but that is debatable.,World Championship starts 20th of April.,Currently, China Open Tournament is on, and in the final Neil Robertson of Australia is leading Mark Selby of England 6-4, in a race to 10.,pic is me, i'm 6ft3 (1.90m), to give you perspective on the size of the table.,that cloth looks like shit. needs a good block. that china open was fucking good though, i loved watching neil win.,Parkour General,Photos, stories, videos and anything else related to parkour/free running are all welcome here. If you want to share a video then please check that it isn't on the first few pages of YouTube videos for the term ""parkour"", as we've all seen them already.,http://youtu.be/FaPCHBVDnIU,David Belle interview, talking about why he started parkour and what it means to him and how it's bettered him as a person,http://youtu.be/M2sWvgsEXeU,Hour and a half long documentary on Lisses, France; the birthplace of parkour, and of the origins of parkour itself. Includes footage of over 150 traceurs,http://youtu.be/QH09YCtpKaw,Hour long documentary on parkour following five freerunners from San Diego to the Nevadan desert,99% there is no issues unless there is pain associated with this. There are lots of moving parts in your joints and that noise is normal. If you are really worried, go to a sports physio specialist. Regular physio or doctor would have no idea - they tend to be afraid of physical activity for some reason.,If there is some pain associated with it, you should make an effort to learn proper stretching and foam rolling. IT (Iliotibial band) band is often tight, and can cause the knee cap (Patella) to track improperly (misalign).,Half squats are a waste of time,For Parkour a high vertical is key, Olympic style Weightlifting has been shown to produce athletes with great verticals, and great acceleration. Take a look at the image, Shane Hamman is a fat fuck, but probably has a higher vertical than anyone that commented on this thread.,You are clearly not strong. using the lightest weight for as long as possible will result in minimal progression,Now you're being totally retarded,Look under the section ""Injury Potential of Weight Training"",http://www.exrx.net/WeightTraining/,Your retardation level continues.,Best way to build useful muscles is simply by training whatver the fuck sport you're doing. It's more natural and works well and is more fun to do.,That's why no pro athlete ever does weight training. No NFL football athlete, no NBA basketball athlete, no Olympic level gymnast, no swimmers, no rowers, no speed skaters, no cyclists, none. No athlete lifts weights at the top level other than weight lifters.,/sarcasm","Bulletball General,BMX Thread,BMX General thread,Skateboarding general, no longfriends allowed.,Choosing a Martial Art thread,Snooker,/pkg/ - Parkour General","03/29/13(Fri)14:41,03/29/13(Fri)16:39,03/29/13(Fri)16:48,03/29/13(Fri)17:05,03/30/13(Sat)23:06,04/01/13(Mon)19:34,03/29/13(Fri)14:07,04/01/13(Mon)17:27,04/01/13(Mon)17:35,04/01/13(Mon)18:01,04/01/13(Mon)18:08,04/01/13(Mon)19:11,04/01/13(Mon)06:03,04/01/13(Mon)18:34,04/01/13(Mon)18:36,04/01/13(Mon)18:47,04/01/13(Mon)18:52,04/01/13(Mon)18:59,03/29/13(Fri)11:44,03/31/13(Sun)11:23,03/31/13(Sun)11:53,03/31/13(Sun)12:59,03/31/13(Sun)13:44,04/01/13(Mon)18:58,03/31/13(Sun)20:12,04/01/13(Mon)17:58,04/01/13(Mon)18:47,03/20/13(Wed)19:58,03/31/13(Sun)20:07,04/01/13(Mon)17:19,04/01/13(Mon)18:24,04/01/13(Mon)18:25,04/01/13(Mon)18:26,03/31/13(Sun)23:41,04/01/13(Mon)09:34,04/01/13(Mon)10:21,04/01/13(Mon)12:29,04/01/13(Mon)17:34,04/01/13(Mon)18:20,03/23/13(Sat)10:49,03/31/13(Sun)03:00,03/31/13(Sun)03:03,03/31/13(Sun)03:04,04/01/13(Mon)15:12,04/01/13(Mon)17:49,04/01/13(Mon)17:47,03/31/13(Sun)12:28,04/01/13(Mon)01:00,04/01/13(Mon)17:40,04/01/13(Mon)14:32,04/01/13(Mon)15:01,04/01/13(Mon)16:35,04/01/13(Mon)17:28,03/30/13(Sat)21:21,04/01/13(Mon)13:43,04/01/13(Mon)15:41,04/01/13(Mon)16:11,04/01/13(Mon)16:45,04/01/13(Mon)16:58,04/01/13(Mon)16:34,03/31/13(Sun)08:53,04/01/13(Mon)16:31,03/25/13(Mon)00:49,04/01/13(Mon)12:45,04/01/13(Mon)12:50,04/01/13(Mon)12:51,04/01/13(Mon)13:48,04/01/13(Mon)15:55","Anonymous,Anonymous,MYVT,MYVT,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Bulletball General,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,BMX Thread,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Ananomouse,BMX General thread,Ananomouse,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Choosing a Martial Art thread,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Snooker,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,/pkg/ - Parkour General,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"
"So what does /asp/ think about Karate?,I've seen it mentioned in a few threads but it doesn't seem to get mentioned much here on /asp/, so I was just wondering what the rest of you guys think about Karate as a martial art? I currently practice Shotokan Karate so admittedly my opinion would be a little bit biased.,You are foolish. Your comparison is invalid and you should be ashamed.,Take traditional Okinawan Karate, traditional Kung Fu, or many other martial arts. All extremely deadly, but almost 100% kata/form practice and very RARELY any sparring.,Yes, there are two-person forms. They teach you how to apply your moves in combat.,Yes, there are two-person exercises. They teach you to have better reaction time and also condition you.,When I practice my two-person forms, I motion to eye-gouge, break bones, manipulate joints, dislocate elbows, etc. While in practice, ONLY strength is held back, not technique. We do constant conditioning exercises to make sure that we'll be able to apply the strength when we need to.,Many martial arts schools now will train people to do well in tournaments or MMA, teaching them only techniques that will do well in point sparring, and none of those moves that are banned from tournament sparring matches. My teacher once explained to me when I inquired about joining tournaments:,""That is just sport. We don't practice that here. Every tournament we've been to, we've been disqualified from."",This is the mentality I keep while practicing martial arts. Would you believe that some people actually believe that wearing gloves that prevent you from proper joint manipulation, training to hit anything but the face, and staying up until the next round are pure representations of their martial art?,How disappointing.,You just say things and expect them to be taken as truth. Two-Person forms do not teach you how to fight, they teach you the feel of the technique, but not the actual execution of it under non-ideal conditions. ,The strength and accuracy at speed are the hard parts, any one can practice a tecunique without strength or intent, because without them they are nothing more than particulairly complicated dance moves.,You guys are cowards, unable to adapt to a set of rules to test your art. There are more forms of competition besides UFC, for example there is the brazilian tradition of Vale Tudo, which allows many of the very strikes that your style is so practiced at. Karate didn't do well there either.,You are peaceful warriors, yet you can't abide by the rules that you agreed to.,Two-person forms do teach you how to fight. I know this from personal experience. It also teaches you to display your art properly instead of resorting to kickboxing techniques like most martial arts schools do while sparring.,Yes, because it sure shows a lack of intent when you only hit someone on the elbow instead of breaking it.,Half of the attacks I've been taught are small joint locks, strikes to the eyes, throat, and groin attacks. I mean, sure, I COULD very well go into tournament play, but would it show the extent of my ability? No. Do I want people judging me based on something that isn't my best? No.,I never said ""we're too deadly,"" just that most of our techniques are banned. There's literally no point in doing it if you can't do it 100%.,Am I the only one really excited for Curling?,It is filled with so much adrenaline, I am not even trolling,A sport that trains people to be janitors?

"Need to know peoples opinions on this,nothing beats a well placed pipebomb,its reputation is the product of jewish propaganda and nothing more,maybe so but its a damn good system,You are all kinds of fail.,404'd,its an ok system, nothing special. It's not bad but it's very basic stuff.,Take more than one or two classes.,This system takes a lot of shit from /asp/, and I'm not exactly sure why. It *is* simple, that's the point. It relies on basic instinct and movement. The nice thing about it is that whatever else you know - judo, jujitsu, muai tai, boxing - can easily be incorporated into it. ,If you go to a proper school, the training sessions are some of the best I've seen. Ultra realistic.,they choose to demo it with fake moves you will never use, that is obviously for the sake of not revealing just how generic it is,it is not doing anything new or different, strike vulnerable areas with speed and ferocity, pretty basic,Everything you've seen has been based off of KM. That's how it's so effective; it's techniques that are mostly easy to remember and utilize in any situation. Because in real situations this is all you will ever need.,Sorry it's not some esoteric Kung Fu that takes a lifetime to master - that shit tends to not work when it needs to.,everything I know comes from a Goju purist from Trinidad that learned it from a German, all of those same defenses are covered.,Its not bad... Pretty standard reality based self defense system.,Its downfall can be the lack of full contact sparring and pressure testing, like most RBSD arts,Pretty good system, although I might be biased having taken it for 7 years now,been doing KM since beginning of the year.Its decent from what ive done so far.,In my life ive done Judo,Karate(both I did from 5 till about 15 years old when I focused more on my rugby union),Also dabbled in wing chun and Muay Thai when I lived in the UK working as a bouncer with a current heavy weight champ in Kickboxing.,Certain parts of it I find pointless or maybe just pointless for me(mainly the choking drills) cos im 6'7 120kgs and broad shouldered so a lot of the choke release moves seem dumb going inside to push out whereas for me i can just go inside out if you get my meaning.,To me KM seems like a modern Jeet Kun Do using what is practical etc.,I think my current lack of enthusiasm is due to there not being people of my height and build at he class and theres a lot of women and few punk kids.,But I want to stick with it cos ive def noticed my speed and thinking has increased.I have pretty devastating kicks for a big man and was good at kick boxing but found it lacked a ground and grapple system other than muay clinch etc.,Overall im learning new stuff keeps me sharp and fit (ive just turned 30 still play rugby and basketball but wanted something I can do where i get to hit people legally ) just sucks that theres so many old people and women I feel like im back in wing chun some days which had a lot of old people slowing the class down etc.,Where I live in Australia is quite remote so theres not too many to chose from.,My instructor thinks I will go far tho because I have heavy hands and heavy kicks and pretty fast for a tall bloke and got a 7foot wing span.Just gotta work on my fitness.,I will admit I hate bowing to the Israeli flag urggh,I don't know what the fuck you're talking about,you know how u make the M with your hands if they are choking you,grab their hands and pull out to release the choke.,Cos everyone who has ever done it on me my natural shoulder width is wider so it feels weird...whereas if im to simply put my wrists on the inside of their arms as they choke i can knock them out to the sides easier than holding their wrists and pull them out.,If you get my meaning,do you know what the fuck im talking about now,jidf pls go,Yeah. The idea behind that your back muscles are always stronger than your hands so you should use them instead of just your arms. You're not supposed to hold their wrists though, just monkey grip them and rip them off your throat with a single movement and get in the simultaneous kick.,All techniques are just guidelines however, you're free to use a variation that you deem better than the original. What you're getting taught are tested and effective techniques however, and the fewer techniques you learn, the less likely it is that you're going to freeze if you actually get choked.,Yeah, how do actually perfect moves if they don't use them on each other without seriously hurting them,Wouldn't expect anything else from Jews,Back to , with you.,It's fact, nothing to do with /pol/,yeah i get what you mean I think just cos of my height and width of my shoulders already its something that just seems strange.,Apart from that everything else I can see why its done etc.,It was strange tho re programming myself to kick people in the nuts..did you find that?I mean coming from styles before where you would bow and would never strike the nuts.,I had done TKD and Muay Thai before I picked up Maga, and yeah I can tell you it was weird.,The mindset in there is completely different though, both TKD and Thai in their current forms are sports (unfortunately), Maga is purely focused on self-defense. You have to take into account the situation, if you're getting choked in the streets there is no fucking time to be gentlemany about it. Hit fast, hit hard and get the fuck out as soon as possible. As for your size, chances are the guy (or girl) choking you is going to be even bigger than you.,yeah i worked as a bouncer in australia and europe for over 10 years and rarely fought many people bigger than me.If they were taller they were lankier..if they were bigger..they were shorter.,After working London where I found that people didnt fight fair and would pull out knives and all sorts you switch to a more strike first method.,I will def stick with it tho cos one my mates who told me to get into it in the UK was one of the maddest cunts i ever worked with.hes now quite calm and passive and controlled in his fighting style now so if he approves of it its good enough for me haha,Yeah, I started training in Krav Maga a couple years ago. Took to it like a duck to water. My thing is, I was originally taught to fight by my step dad, my uncle, and a handful of friends of the family-between them, more than a century of time spent in prison. Inflicting the most damage possible with the most brutal offense necessary is the foundation anything else I learn is built on; the transition to Krav Maga was quite easy, it just reinforced what I already knew in a more coordinated manner.,My only complaint with the system is that at this point, it seems a bit...shallow. It really does seem like there's a hard limit on what the style has to offer. I've pretty much decided I'm gonna have to branch out if I'm going to add anything to my arsenal. Still weighing my options, before I decide what to pick.,/asp/ies hate KM because it doesn't have the element of Eastern mysticism that they paid to experience at the McDojo at the strip mall. The same retards who shit on self-defense and Western martial arts are the same fags who believe that you have to register you hands as weapons once you become a black belt.,you are doing a lot of strawmanning there.,I don't think there is anyone that doesn't ""like"" krav, and the consensus from the other people is it's a fine system but incredibly basic and highly overrated because it gets marketed and eaten up as some kind of master combat style.,It is a basic system, nut shots, short elbows, and gun disarms are nothing new, they are not innovative. Very basic maneuvers.,No /asp/ definitely shits on it and that stems from their own ignorance and the bullshit drilled into them by their instructors. ,Krav Maga is basic but that's where its strength comes from it's easy to learn and pick up. For those who are already experienced with martial arts it greatly complements existing styles with its approach and mentality towards fighting.,Its pretty basic and doesn't have a lot of pressure testing. Thats why most people have problems with it. Its just another RBSD, its nothing amazing.,what is its mentality towards fighting?,My karate school believe in ruthless countermeasures, neutralize them physically, do it in a way that they will have something to think about afterwards.,you do not hold someone in an arm bar, you break their elbow, you do not simply choke someone out, you throw them on the ground and kick them in the head while they are unconscious. It is not only much faster than holding someone in place but it neutralizes them indefinitely. If I was to flip someone on the ground and they are giving up I am going to kick them in the teeth too for good measure.,one of my class mates was doing krav along side what we were doing, he would go over what he learned all the time and he never once brought something new to the table I have not seen before.,My school trained karate and ju jitsu with lite judo. Everything krav teaches is covered and more, it does not take more than a couple of classes to become proficient in those basic self defense moves so honestly I am going to call scam on any establishment that is keeping the same students involved for years,do you think karate is a pussy martial art and you don't even know what you're talking about? in the case you know what you're talking about let me tell you something, the most lethal martial art is not even about using punches and kicks but striking with the tips of the finger...and something else Krav Maga has base on Karate too..,Do you really think a Judoka or BJJ practitioner couldn't break someone's arm if they wanted to?,Try sparring some time. You'll find that executing even simple techniques becomes a lot harder.,I'm extremely skeptical of everything you just said. ,It's one thing to theorize and softly practice these techniques but it's a completely different to practice them fast paced and with aliveness. ,No. There's something called muscle memory and it takes more than a couple of classes to become proficient in any style.,nice trips faggot.,Also, there's a submission called a pipebomb.,Courtesy of tenth planet jiu jitsu.,You do that and you belong in jail.,Just saying.,Guys.,I found real-life Cobra Kai.,pretty much, that is how we do things,they could absolutely break peoples joints if they wanted to, but the line is drawn where they probably will not, their first instinct would be to go for a submission, mine would be to go for a break.,The difference between a tap and a break is a matter of just a little bit more effort. I doubt that you guys practice actively snapping each others limbs, and likely train to submission, whch is excatly how BJJ and Jiu-Jitsu generally train.,Wing chun was here,,Well I guess your disarming techniques are cool.,we train them with a jerking motion, not an easing one, we just don't pull as hard as we can.,if we are stomping someones head in we will stop just before contact or just tap them with the strength of a jab or so.,accidental injuries have happened.,I'm recovering from a finger that was slammed jammed against the floor during rolls, I can understand that much. ,So, you're saying you do the technique fluidly, with speed? We do that too.,Wouldn't that teach you to hesitate before stamping someone's face in?,nah, the fight is already won at that point, a follow through is no problem at all.,If less than 80% of what you train in your martial art cannot be drilled full speed then do not rely in this martial art for anything. ,There are lots of good self defense systems on the market. You know that they are good ones because they do self defense technique training plus sparring,mfw,this is why KM has done so well in UFC.,Back in the day, trolling meant something...,Self defense has no rules. UFC has tons to protect their overpaid fighters.,ufc didnt have any rules in the early days and bjj dominated everything,that was because early days ufc is a publicity stunt for bjj,the gracies just picked random people off the street and a couple of half decent guys and called them 'fighters',What about ken Shamrock, oleg taktarov and Dan Severn?

I'm sure WWE seems far better if you only watch WWE PPVs.,Oh lawd,The Rock sucks, why doesn't Cena get more cheers?

Like what gets you kicked out or talked to if you shout it?,I wouldn't mind not having that.

Or to have this feud with someone else? Dortio and Ricardo should feud with someone else. I just don't know who,jinsei is king. japanese undertaker.,He's impressive in the ring too,They should have him trying to kidnap divas again. Shit was comedy...gold.,Golddust is funny, but WWE doesn't need to be funny right now. They need to become more serious with their product,Fuck yes, I can't wait. Can you guys fill me in on any important details please?,Brock vs HHH,CM Punk vs Undertaker,The Rock vs John Cena,Fandango vs Jericho ,(only matches you should care about),Bonus: Jack Swagger vs Alberto Del Rio,WWE should make the message they're sending with WE THE PEOPLE clearer. Zeb hates anyone foreign because they're foreign and just throws around the term 'illegal' willy nilly regardless of whether he's talking about someone who actually is in the US unlawfully. But no-one ever calls him out on that. He should be seen as the bad guy for being an antiquated bigot, but they're painting it as though he's the bad guy for daring to speak up about a legitimate issue instead of burying his head in the sand like 'normal' people. I've seen people support Zeb & Swagger in the feud because of how murky and shades-of-grey the whole bloody mess has been written.,My sides,Book it,What if he was kidnapping manlets instead?,Also. I miss Boogeyman. Guy waa prety good and hilarious.,Brock vs HHH: Brock went after all of HHH's friends and family (like a fucking beast) Now HHH wants revenge.,CM Punk vs Undertaker:CM Punk disrespected Paul Bearers death tribute by the Undertaker, now Undertaker wants revenge. ,The Rock vs John Cena: They faced off last year with The Rock winning. The Rock is the current champion that rarely shows up to RAW anymore to do promos (which are shit anyways) John Cena wants this win because when he lost, his life turned to shit. This win is everything to him. It's also a title match,Fandango vs Jericho: Jericho disrespected Fandango (dance gimmick, great on mic, beautiful in ring) by mispronouncing his name. This feud is most likely just to put him over as a heel.,Jack Swagger vs Alberto Del Rio: Jack Swagger and manager, Zeb Culter, have been making racist statements twoards Del Rio (mexican) about immagration and how they aren't real Americans. Swagger and Culter are like Red-Neck, tea-party people. Super racists, but make some good points,Boogeyman was rather entertaining. I remember when he bit that shit off Jillian Hall's face,Huh. How about no. Shut doqn the border and throw the illegals and there illegal children back across the border.,If they refuse, declare hem enemies of the state and shoot them.,But of course, that might undermine your voting base wouldnt?,Plz. Take this shit to /pol/ and flush it.,That was a great match. Hakushi was rather impressive,Main event is Rock vs Cena II. Rock came back last year to kick Cena's ass for being an insipid childish goof of a Top Star and avenge the 8 wasted years of adult wrestling fans around the world. He made true on his word and beat Cena clean, and Cena's spent the last year obsessing over getting his win back since he can't deal with losing to someone. Rock won the title, Cena won the Rumble, so he gets his precious rematch.,Brock vs HHH is about Brock coming back from MMA and deciding to become dominant male of WWE again by wrecking everyone's shit. HHH didn't take kindly to that so had a match with him, wherein Brock promptly broke his fucking arm. HHH apparently retired, Brock disappeared for a few months since he'd proven his point, but now they're both back for the big rematch so HHH can get his revenge.,Taker vs Punk is about CM Punk, #2 star after Cena, villain extraordinaire and BEST IN THE WORRRLD, getting colon crucified that Rock ended his 400+ day WWE Title reign and wanting to take it out on the fans. He's decided that the best way to make everyone cry is to break Undertaker's Streak. Paul Bearer recently died for real so that's become a recurring part of the storyline.,ADR vs Swgger for the WHC is about a charming Mexican Champ fending off a burly racist superpatriot, Shield vs Sheamus/Orton/Big Show is a team of thuggish TDKR-fans fighting some high-profile heroes who didn't get their own matches, Ryback vs Henry is HOSS FIGHT MOTHERFUCKERRRRRRRRRRRR and everything else is last-minute filler you don't need to know shit about.,I like your summary better,take it easy man we're trying to talk about rasslin here,Zeb wants Del Rio gone for being 'illegal' despite him being a kayfabe-millionaire who I daresay can afford a Visa. He's also spoken out against Sin Cara, Wade Barrett, even fucking Jericho for being Canadian, all of whom aren't actually illegal either. He's an antiquated bigot because he hates people who aren't American SIMPLY FOR BEING DIFFERENT, and just says the word 'illegal' over and over again because its a wonderful little buzzword that gets people to perk their ears up when he gets on his soap-box.,But WWE never drive that crucial point home, and that's the problem I'm talking about. If people are in your country illegally, fine. You have every right to not want them there. Zeb shouldn't be painted as the heel for saying that. And yet they go on and on about him wanting illegals gone as though that IS the reason he's heel, not because he's basally prejudiced.,I'm not even American and don't give a shit about political drama. Hence why I don't want to see it brought into my goddamn rasslin.,Britfag here, will there be streams for wrestlemania? I don't want to pay for it,Like I think the problem with Zeb is that they're not going far enough. Make him the SUPER-MURRICAN and have him go after Barrett, Jericho, etc. Stop having him focus on the Mexicans. Make him more cartoony and silly.,Hey ya'll, what did I miss?,Summarizing of WM 29,Besides wee.com where the streams for wrestlemania at?,No idea,Check your local sports bars/snooker bars to see if any of them are broadcasting it. That's how I'm seeing it. thankyouuu Riley's.,nice try, vince,Vince is going to fire those streams,There is no way upstanding citizens such as us would illegally stream WrestleMania, sir.,as bad as dana white is about UFC being illegally streamed, I can't even imagine what goes through vince's head when some 20something IT manager tells him about all the people who don't pay for PPVs,Vince gets mad and raises the price on WrestleMania while suing the streamers,What is you guy's favorite move? Mine is the power slam,used to be a good powerbomb before I knew how dangerous of a move it can be, now I mark out for ziggler-style DDTs and any kind of bulldog since playing dead rising 2,I like Mickie James' DDT,Power bombs are pretty safe if you know how to do them effectively, but the WWE for a while wasn't concerned about safety.,Khali fucking killed a guy with a powerbomb,Chokeslam, all the way.,Who's choke slam (if you have a preference),I said somebody who knows how to do it effectively.,Who would you say has the best (and safest) powerbomb?,I can't say the best and the safest are synonymous. But Batista's powerbomb was pretty clean, Swagger's Gutwrench is pretty clean too.,Best would have to be the Razor's Edge. Even if that move was a neck destroyer.,2000-2002 Kane had some of the best chokeslams I've ever seen.,His chokeslam on Test when he returned in 2000 was pretty boss.,Can someone post a link to the /asp/ championship wiki? Thanks,I can link you to our steam group with a link to the wiki!,http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CE,Looks like it's always done shitty,Wish I could participate, fucking email verification,Not on steam, sorry. Thank you for the link though,Tall guys always have the best chokeslams,this is the 21st century why do you not use steam?,Cause I'm not a gamer,fix'd,I don't play video games and when I do I play them on consoles,The bigger the better. Kane does it great, especially when the camera shows how afraid the guy on the receiving end is. Big Show's are good too, but overall kinda tiring, like when he repeatedly chokeslammed the entire roster of Smackdown.,not gonna lie you just lost points in my book gayda,Are there any good sites for this shit? Are there any nudes of any of them? Inb4 Chyna,Loved this one,At 3:56,http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x7,I can't get into Show's, because they're constantly fluxing.,First he does it large and slams them from crazy heights, then it's he slightly picks them up, falls to his knees and then slams them down or he lifts them up half way and slams them.,Chyna,Candace Michelle,Kelly Kelly (I'm sure),Maryse,Dead thread? Not on my watch,Eh, I don't think any of them will be showing it and I would prefer to watch it at a friend's house.,PLAYA,HOLLA HOLLA,I want to hear that chant live on RAW,Stop it Vince,Batista,...Not even mad,Because he's not a fucking nerd, you fucking nerd,Sable/Torrie,Implying Ziggler is not taught by him,Hakushi is the international wrestler inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame this year, so he will make an appearance on WrestleMania,Ziggler can sell the a cool breeze,Reminds me of the time that TNA was boasting their PPV was trending in the UK when in reality there is no legal way to watch TNA's PPV there,That's just him shifting into a spot.,It was overselling,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNhI,he was put in the spot, then over sold and and to re-position himself right where he already was.,thanks for the monkey flips...i didnt know he did that,I'd take that kind of overselling compared to Shawn. It doesn't really look bad to me.,you're supposed to oversell the signature and finisher moves though.,Exactly. Part of the reason I love the chokeslam is how when it works right, the guy on the receiving end really oversells it.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJqh,bitches better not shit talk based fandango ,captcha: ringdfr,He's looking like the new /asp/ champion, unless Jericho loses the title before Mania.,lol we need a gif of that stunner now.,Smooth.,Exactly,Google is this cool thing.,I've heard it a coupla times over the past year or so, may have been during a PPV tho,scott hall's stunner sell is de best,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysv,Pleb,i just got home. made some easter eggs. ,sup,You had more fun then me,livin' the tripfag attention whore dream, eh?,Yes,Originally, Cena was supppsed to sell Brocks comeback. But...yeH..,Awww shucky ducky, quack quaaaaaaack,Shithead.,steenalizer,I love you <3,We are tripfags, what do you expect,That's just cruel ,Oh Carter,I would to. Hmmm...I should have my crafty gf try to make one.,Gotta start marketing,I don't know how...We need more HEAAAAAAAAAAAAAT,HEEL HEAT,I neeeeeeeeeeeeeed it.,We invade /sp/ during RAW,lol We need to see how the Mania invasion goes first.,Oh yeah, Mania is next Sunday right?,Yeah they probably won't. And they def won't be seeing a push anytime soon. It's kinda unfortunate, but they are boring in the ring.,Yuuuuuuuuup,Crap, I need to watch Smackdown.,Not really. Just Johnny Ace's segment,That other wrestler in that Stone Cold movie on a island was also once a prisoner. Aussie though.,Cute. Shes gonna be a hottie too.,you creep mutha fucka,Fucking mongrel.,B-But I wanna smoke and drink beers while watch some wrestling. :(,Just saw this. 10/10 mad,Vince and Haitch look huge. Also how do you NOT know how to spell McMahon,Probably o nly knows them because her man is an Attitude Era bby I'm betting.,PFFFFTTT, HA-HA-HA. Vince McMonn, classic.,Vince McMann is McMahon's good twin,shoulda been something like this,Does anyone even think Brock will win?,Like I said, probably only knows them through her boyfriend.,The twin that makes the good show?,I do,That .gif reminds me how I'm like the only one here who likes Sheamus. I appreciate a wrestler who doesn't care about good guys or bad guys, and just loves a good fight. I really want him to sorta turn heel and challenge Orton or Beeg because he thinks they're worthy opponents or something. Alternatively, have him feud with Kane.,You are misinterpreting his character a lot. Sheamus is nowhere near as tweener as you're implying.,Though he could pull it off. But tweeners are a thing of the past in this new WWE.,say it with me:,BRRRRROOOOCKK ,LESSSNARRRRRR,BOOOORRRRRRRRRRKKKKKKKKKK ,LASSSERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR,What happens to Triple H then?,He's a mid-carder that didn't bury his way to the top?,Sheamus pls go,It's not like he was on tv anyway so whats the point?,Tfw you just did a People's Elbow on cam,Oh wow Carter you're so based,Based Carter,Wait really?,What if Johnny Ace aligns with Cena? Stone Cold/Vince Mcmahon style?,Yup,Shame-us pls go. You're bad at wrasslin' and are only around because you're HHH's fanny bandit.,Oh by the way Laurinaitis. It's a pet peeve of mine since his nephew plays on the Rams; been a stickler about it since he was drafted.,Also I just read about it,Geez thanks Vince.,No wonder everyone just calls it a fameasser, leg drop bulldog sound retarded.,Yeah that ""angle"" if you can call it that doesn't even make sense. And I've watched a few vids/read comments on it and people are ok with it. The fact that people buy the whole People Power and The Rock is the People's Champion thing is ludicrous. I could understand if he came back on Raw and did this and was just backstage and shook Cena's hand or SOMETHING involving Cena. But why would he be in the Rock's corner? He doesn't know The Rock and he has no previous relationship with him. And it was the fucking opening segment. It just comes off as a ""clever"" way to hide the fact that Cena isn't there.,His Brother is Road Warrior Animal,Who's son is James Laurinaitis,People power,Two pro wrestlers, one NFL LBer. It's like they're mad to be successful.,Where can I watch SHIMMER shows online? ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbx,Why would you want to do that? Are they good?,From what I've heard, yes. And that vid looked cool.,Pure Women's wrestling,see if this works,http://nobuffer.info/pl.php?url=332,I'll check them out,Fapping time,Let's see what you have here.,Talented womens,Jesus christ,I am wrong then,ugh,God she was pretty,wtf?,Ace Crusher!!,For The Rock,friend says download steam h-here i go,why,What if it was me, what if it was me?!,Could you stop shitposting?,define shitposting,I'd do it faster than what I am and send hearts,And you didn't even say please.,The commentary on this is decent.,Seriously, there's like 20 people and just...The wrestling is so bad I'm glad I'm having a drink. I see why this stuff is so hard to find.,The Indy's don't do it for me,It's something you have to either grow up watching, or take a long time to get used to. ,Once you get over the lack of production work and embrace the corniness it can be great to just veg out to.,It's not spoon fed to me like RAW is,I'm trying..I'm trying really hard. I just don't get why this dumb shit is happening. It could be so much better if they weren't stupid and fucking around and actually trained more.,Had to expose the truth,Shimmer is just this side of Chikara.,Damn youuuuuuuuuuuuuuu,That...explains so much...knowing that, I'm wondering why the fuck people even pay for this,Well shit,Not...enough....beer,I've been practicing my wrestling kicks,Like I said, indie wrasslin' and WWE are pretty much two different hobbies. ,ROH, Dragon Gate, OVW, etc are not really all that different.,Have you killed any lamps yet?,But are all of them this bad? Is this bad on purpose so we (WWE fans) can laugh at? Or is this them being ""serious""?,All indie shows start off with comedy bits and move on towards the more serious angles. And there are always crappy rap entrances.,Now some black chick is wrestling some bitch who doesn't even having wrestling attire.,No, I'm not retarded,That's the ROH effect. Matches between faces are ""honorable"" and used to feature handshakes before and after. In Shimmer they hug, because you know, girls.,Try imagining you are watching Monday Night Raw. Now imagine McMahon comes out. Now imagine Jim Ross energetically calls out his name.,OH GOD! PHANTASIO HAS A DAUGHTER!,I can't because this lady is yelling at someone in the crowd and he's yelling back at her. 2muchbanter4me,OH MY GOD THAT DIVING STUNNER,Welp, that took me right out of it.,Non American here. How relevant is NWA in USA nowadays? I keep hearing about them when watching documentaries,Kill me now.,It's dead.,The current champ is Rob Conway.,And this is all the precious CM Punk stands for.,Kill me in my dreams,I long for the days of bra and panties matches now.,frickin' thighs on this chick,What is everyone watching?,Links,just wait until you see what the champ looks like,http://nobuffer.info/pl.php?url=332,Here comes the botches. You know if you can't do lucha style, you really shouldn't be trying to hop off the ropes like that.,I'm already bailing out,I swear the ropes on Shimmer's ring are closer together, or lower. I do not remember Alyssa Flash being that huge.,I feel like I should be paid to watch this.,The fuck is this? Please tell me this gets better.,You really should. The camera is fucking shit. The ring is too fucking loud,The Reason my name is Gayda Meter,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3wG,I guess they really don't give a fuck about ever making more than $20 a show.,If by better you mean shameful and funny...then yes. Sara Del Ray seems to be the CM Punk of the show. So..that's a thing....I guess,This really makes me respect Raw on a whole new level. I will never complain about divas matches again.,There's no way they even make that much.,I can't do this shit,Ever. At least WWE has good production value,My fucking sides,I haven't been there in ages.,That was the best match I've ever seen,fucking plebs,I want to sue really badly.,I know, it's so weird. I can't even complain about TNA and their loud ass footsteps. I had to put on my shit headphones and lower the volume just to tolerate this shit.,At least Britani Knight is in this match.,They don't make any money from the Shimmer shows. Not a dime. They probably end up out least a couple hundred each.,Links to this promotion,Sue those bastards to hell,Brittani is a saint,I see why,cept there's joshi on this show,3 bitches in purple.,Prepare your confusion face.,What?,Link please,They should pay the fans.,take your pick ,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_o,bad production values =! shitty product,take a look at pwg, their cameras suck, they use the same american legion hall in reseda, their tag team title belts look like ass but their in ring product is some of the best wrestling ever but doesnt get much attention because LOLINTERDEPENDENT,http://wwr-stardom.p-kit.com/page00,I don't know, I kinda like not knowing who the fuck is going to come through the curtain on indie shows. Reminds me of when I first got into wrestling when I was a kid.,Joshi can be hardcore at times.,I'd rather watch Indies in on a streaming site with others, so we can make fun of it,I just want Kaitlyn to be a dyke so badly,And why don't people care? Because 1 no big names and 2 shitty production. No one is saying you need a Vince McMahon wallet. But holy shit, some of this stuff looks like it's filmed with cellphone cameras.,If you can do those things. People will watch and enjoy. But, if you miss just one of those things people won't watch. Plus having a story doesn't hurt either because that way you can get more invested into what's going on in the ring. ,Some girl who doesn't name herself is walking into some room, she says she's going to meet this wrestler who we don't know. Girls come running out (who are they??). Some girl on the ground. Then the girl basically says ""YOU CANT DO THIS, IM GONNA GET YOU"" and that's it.,if you want to make fun of any indy make fun of czw. they kinda deserve it,On April 29, 1997 she had her retirement match against Tsuchiya in a ""No ropes 200V double hell double barbed wire barricade double landmine glass crush death match"". This refers to a match fought under hardcore rules wherein the ropes are removed and replaced by 200V electrified, double-layered barbed wire; and the ring surrounded by double layers of landmines and broken glass.

"I know it s a long shot but I anyone can do it you guys,What is the martial art that Snake uses in MGS2 ?,From the combos I think its kickbox but you would know better,It's a unique in-universe style simply called CQC, close-quarters combat.,Isn't Snake told he didnt use CQC until 4th game,Of course its a game they maybe didn't use any technique but they used military experts for shooting and sneaking animations,I thought maybe they used real martial arts experts for fighting,I don't recall snake using anything other than the kick punch combo in this game, outside of the gunplay.,I think its referred to as ""spam M9 heatshots"",Did you even play the fucking games?,not OP but solid snake does not use CQC until mgs4,OP didn't specify ""solid snake"", just ""snake"". Pretty sure it is referred to as CQC in MGS3.,cardboard box,I haven't played MGS4 but from playing MGS3 pathologically/no guns I'd say CQC looks most like a form of aikido/jujitsu (sometimes expressed/taught as aikijujitsu, as they have some overlap). Note: not jujitsu like BJJ, which is mostly about ground game, but traditional japanese jujitsu which in my experience is split equally into joint locks, throws/takedowns, and ground game and blending those into each other.,Think joint locks, countering just about anything an opponent throws at you and using it to knock them to the ground, throws/takedowns, and chokes - you use a ton of these in MGS3, especially the final boss fight, if you're playing the game ""right"".,The MGS wiki says it's similar to judo.

"skateboarding heroes general,you dont have to fan out so hard,It's Marc Johnson, bro. I understand OP.,Nuff said,by that definition 3/4 of pro skateboarders should be unemployed,naw m8 mike mo is one of the most deserving, and his parts arent filled with obnoxious shit so that's always a plus,rodney doesnt count he's on his own level,I'm not even gay, but shane is one qt motherfucker,is everyone here really young?,im not saying every skater needs to be squeaky clean or even clean, but i think that its good for some pros to carry themselves a certain way to show parents that just because their kid wants to skate doesnt mean they will break shit, smoke weed and get drunk.,again, i personally dont care what pros do, im interested in skateboarding, and as long as they do that, nothing else really matters.,like i said, not everyone sees it that way.,believe it or not, a lot of people develop a negative attitude toward skateboarding.,i think that if a kid wants to get a skateboard, he should be able to, but parents dont want their children falling into a ""negative crowd"".,by some skaters presenting themselves in a positive light, parents understand that they arent all so bad, and buy said child a skateboard.,this kid could be the next rodney mullen, eric koston, mikemo, etc.,but what if their parents didnt get them that skateboard because of that reason? wasted talent.,although it's probably beyond your understanding considering you cant formulate an educated argument and had to post a top lel reaction mfw XD,He gives skateing a terrible image. He's clean as fuck, but he has no style. And he's covered in energy drink sponsors all over his board. It's fucking gross.,You want more goons skating because they make it family friendly? And ""wasted talent"" then? God forbid little Timmy won't grow up to be the next street league champion. Is this what happened to you?,how is that different from any other sport? yes, it is looked down upon, and i dont really like it either, but it's for the betterment of the sport as a whole. same goes for all of the other street-league tier skaters.,people like shane, chris cole, chaz fagtize, etc. are doing what they do so that most other skaters dont have to, they're making the sport viable and spreading the fun of skateboarding to more and more people. ,so to you and i, yes, they're selling out, but look at the bigger picture, they're giving more people the chance to potentially discover something they love, and that's really what skating is about.,but yeah his style could use a bit of work, in time perhaps, he cant be older than 25,stop right there dyrdek. your opinions are now invalid.,it wouldnt be family friendly, but i think that anyone who wants to skate should be allowed to, and if a kids parents wont let them skate because they dont like the image, that's unfortunate.,not looking for a miracle story, but like i said before, every kid should be allowed a skateboard if they want one, it's the most beautiful art out there.,and of course it didnt happen to me, why would i even care about skateboarding now if as i kid my parents shot down the idea of getting one?,you miss the point anyway though. ,no child, teenager, whatever should be denied a skateboard because of its image (dont even bring up financial issues, that's an enitrely different story) ,and this doesnt only impact those who want to skate, we've been trying to get a skatepark built here in my city for over a decade, and its always been shot down because of old people and soccer moms bitching that they dont want their kids getting into trouble.,i dont want to get off track as im also in 5 other threads on different boards, but my point is:,if more people are accepting of skateboarding via x-games, street league, etc. it can benefit skaters as well, maybe you still have the skate, fuck shit up mentality, im not judging you, but to attack me because i dont like the fact that kids cant skate and that towns cant even get a goddamn skatepark because of an image or culture, that's just fucking ridiculous,Oh this is the problem You can't get a park built so its why you come crying here. It all makes sense now.,i really dont see how difficult it is to realize that the public accepting skateboarding as a sport would be beneficial.,every day millions of people pass shady basketball players on their way home from work, and say ""they look shady, but that's just them, not everyone who plays basketball wants to stab me, my son wants a basketball for christmas, ill get him one, because basketball does not coincide with crime"",the same people see kids skateboarding on their way home and say ""those kids MUST but shady and want to kill me because thats what skateboarders do, im sure as shit not gettig my kid the skateboard he wants for christmas because hell start hanging out with them and begin to rob people!"",like i said, you and i know its actually probably the sketchy guys playing basketball that are more likely to attack said average low to uppermiddle class citizen than a skateboarder, but the public has the opposite idea.,image is a terrible thing.,you're painfully short-sighted, but i think i have it explained here ,if you really cant understand my point, i give up.,even though you've probably just been a ruseman from the start,what kind of backwoods shithole do you live in where people playing basketball are considered dangerous? oh wait you meant black people. that post really did explain everything.,How old are you?,Citation needed.",WHY IS MIKE MO SO QT,"03/31/13(Sun)11:58,03/31/13(Sun)12:10,03/31/13(Sun)12:13,03/31/13(Sun)12:14,03/31/13(Sun)12:14,03/31/13(Sun)12:18,03/31/13(Sun)12:20,03/31/13(Sun)12:26,03/31/13(Sun)12:35,03/31/13(Sun)12:46,03/31/13(Sun)12:48,03/31/13(Sun)12:57,03/31/13(Sun)13:14,03/31/13(Sun)13:24,03/31/13(Sun)13:27,03/31/13(Sun)13:37,03/31/13(Sun)13:41,03/31/13(Sun)13:47,03/31/13(Sun)13:54,03/31/13(Sun)13:57,03/31/13(Sun)14:05,03/31/13(Sun)14:07,03/31/13(Sun)14:12","Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,WHY IS MIKE MO SO QT,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"

"show me your epic shots, any sport. ill start with a couple.,used to ride for neversummer, 686 and Board Room. Also snowboard general thread, ask me anything.,also, corked frontside seven, stalefish grab.,SPOT DA LANDING,nose to nose. lotsa nose.,nothing epic here, just fucking around. But THAT is how you tweak a method off a little piddly kicker.,anyone?,Wear a helmet. Do you ride terrain?,I didnt wear a helmet unless I was trying something new. Yes, quite a bit. We used to make some fun stuff on the mine dumps up at loveland pass. I fucking love cliffs. Would ride anything, had some friends with sleds.,it was spring break, they were handing out leis at the base. i stuffed it in my pocket. You must have never filmed or done a photoshoot on snow. bright colors are a must in the gear bin.,also, when the fuck did 4chan become the fucking helmet police? I made it through 8 years of 150+ day seasons without a single broken bone or major injury and only wore a helmet on days when we were trying new tricks. Never rode back country without a beacon and shovel though.,So nobody on this site has any good shots?,Sick. I definitely ride a lot more terrain than I do park. Crested Butte is known for its steeps.,Then again I can skateboard park for free.,good ol crusty butt. a good hill when they have good snow. lived there for a few weeks in a motorhome when i was chasing the snow with a gold pass. ,Guaranteed best inbounds day in the state = opening day of the back bowls at vail. guaranteed tits deep almost every year and they tend to do it on a weekday as a sort of local appreciation thing.,Not really, I have a bunch of unedited gopro footy from the past two seasons. I like riding more than worying about documenting it.,It's never a matter of if with injury, it's a matter of when. A helmet is a lot cheaper than having your skull put back together.,we didnt have gopros back then, woulda been nice. i know the injury deal, i lost a third of my buddies every season to blown out knees, tib/fibs, etc. i hate how helmets throw off your balance, even just a little. meh, to each their own.,bump with skihitler,here you go,btw tomorrow a session with dj, beer and burgers at my home ressort (patscherkofel),shits gonna be good,whoever that is knows a proper fucking method. i did a couple of the superparks at keystone back in the day. they made a fucking insane channel gap.,if that is you, i concede, that is a fucking lofty gap. Biggest thing i ever hit was something around 75-80 with a 15 foot tall wedge. ah was scurred. keystone was my stomping grounds.,yeah, reverse image search. wolololo,Hey OP im looking into getting into snowboarding since i started skateing/longboarding this summer. Ausfag. Anyway what are some beginner tips? I plan on going down for a week in snow season, get a couple of lessons, get the basics of control and stopping down.My goal is that at the end of the week i'll have some sick runs, and get some small air. ,Any suggestions? What do i need? Helmets, braces etc?,lessons and rentals. the people that teach beginners are fucking ace at that shit. best advice?,always err on the uphill side. never catch your downhill edge. when in doubt, lean back.,also, bump.,also, never plant a wrist, plant a fist. keep your hands balled in a fist when starting. broken wrists are one of the most common beginner breaks.,also bump.,nobody around here has some good stills of themselves doing epic epicness? wtf 4chan, i thought you were radbad.,Snowboarding is for faggots.,My first backflip photo,Whoops forgot photo,i have no idea what is going on here.,cool, you in that race?,then WAT,that guys pants make his crotch look like a fucking owl.,nothing too epic unfortunately, I blame the wind,i was hoping for shots of actual fucking channers, but fuck yeah.,i wish i didnt hate the ocean, i would love surfing or windsurfing. thanks for 'bootin. how long have you been windsurfing? we have something similar up here with the kiteboarding shit on snow... it doesnt make sense or look like fun, but who am i to judge?,In the Tour De France a couple of years back, a camera car caused a bit of a crash. That bleeding fellow there is Johnny Hoogerland, who was launched off the track and through a barbed wire fence.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mSe,holy fucking shit. HE TOLD YOU HE WAS HARDCORE!,he fucking at shit like a champ and said fuck it.,I have been windsurfing for eight years now, it is definitely my most favourite sport. Not exactly easy to learn, but if you're not completely untaledted and are willing to put some time in it, you will go FAST as a result. The problem with epic shots is that when the wind is strong enough for epic stuff, everyone is on the water instead of taking photos.,And what exactly is your problem with the ocean? Is it the salty taste or some phobia?,I heard of the kiteboarding on snow thing, my brother told me that he once saw someone do it on a mountain in southern germany. Sounds cool, I would appreciate some pictures.,yeah, i get the basic mechanics of it, all in the lean and balance against the force of the wind plus other factors. i bet i would enjoy the shit out of it.,i just have an irrational fear of the ocean, something about a lack of control. a skatepark or snowy hill is predictable and has no sharks or stingrays. i dunno.,LMGTFY,best i could find quickly. i always had the idea of 'i dont give a fuck what you are doing, fruit booting, ski bike, whatever, as long as you are having fun on the hill and stay the fuck out of my way/obey basic rules, then fuck yeah!' so many judgemental assholes out there, i bet the same goes for ocean sports.,Sorry, I thought you had some self-made pictures.,Best advice I can give you if you have an irrational fear of the sea: go swimming.,all my self shots are the thread openers. never windboarded. i prefer gravity as propulsion on the hill. i swim, i love cliff diving at lake powell, just dont like the ocean. grew up wakeboarding, and water skiing etc. hell, i can still get up on 1 ski if the boat has some oomph.,Is 18-19 too late to start? Not professionally or anything, but I'd like to be skilled recreationally, you know?,Is there a snowboarding culture? I used to go sometimes when I was 8 or 9 but we didn't have enough money to go again after that. It was a blast, though.,fuck no its not too late. i highly recommend some lessons and starting with rentals. it is a huge investment of a hobby, but totally worth it. there is a snowboarding culture and it can be a bit intimidating when you start fucking around in the terrain park, but most places now have a beginner, intermediate and advanced park so you can work your way up. once you get a season pass and your own gear setup [trust me, heat molded boots to your feet and a good board/binding setup make a world of difference] you are golden. but dont blow money on that shit till you know you want to shred and can link heel to toe turns.,So you're this guy ,? I asked a question in that thread, do you get paid to ride?,I'm a snowboarder myself, just came home from a trip to Laax/Switzerland. ,Don't have any epic shots of that either, unfortunately. Also kickers like in the OP scare my shit, I fell on my back last year because I fucked up while jumping. Hurt like fuck. But I'm getting better and the kickers I can take on keep getting higher every time.,i never actually collected a paycheck, but i got free shit all over and sold it on ebay to make ends meet. also worked graveyards phone jockey for keystone for 4 years when i lived there to get rent together and live cheap in employee housing. never made it to europe for riding, but always wanted to. that jump was a 10 foot or so wedge and about a 65 foot gap. jumps are something you have to start small and work up. always go faster than you think you should. overshooting a jump is always better than decking it until the point where you overshoot the landing. never shred the lip and lose speed, watch other poeoples lines to get a good idea of what you should do for proper speed on jumps you havent hit. flying without wings is the best fucking feeling in the world.,Holy shit, that's a lot! Biggest one I ever did was 12 foot. But as I said, I keep getting better.,the big line at keystone is no fucking joke. it is designed by skiers so the speed line required a bit of a b-line to get speed. work up to twenties and thirties man, decking those isnt shit if you have some legs under you. also you can get some spins out clean off them. big jumps are fuckin scary till you hit them. just make sure when you get to that size that you are clear of the knuckle. even if you land on your head, if you are on the landing tranny you arent going to get too fucked up.,About an hour north of my hometown there is this indoor slope. I went there once with a few friends. There was a kicker at the end of the slope, and it was so badly designed that it was impossible for my slender 16-year-old self to make it over the flat. Even if I skipped everything on the whole slope and just went straight for the jump I didn't make it. Made me rage pretty hard.,take a vacay to colorado. next season of course... but holy shit we know how to make jumps out here. a good speed line is critical so you can make a nice s-curve between jumps and get your spin/invert on. unless you are being a fucking crazy bastard, always spin frontside off your heel edge and backside off your toe edge. a good s-curve maintaining speed to do so is critical.,Never saw such an s-curve, but I guess what you said doesn't matter that much on those smaller jumps. Anyway, I need to get some sleep to get up early, yurop time. Let's hope this board stays and doesn't get completely overrun by WWE fags.,cheers /b/ro. keep shreddin.",,"03/29/13(Fri)19:23,03/29/13(Fri)19:24,03/29/13(Fri)19:26,03/29/13(Fri)19:31,03/29/13(Fri)19:40,03/29/13(Fri)19:44,03/29/13(Fri)19:52,03/29/13(Fri)20:05,03/29/13(Fri)20:10,03/29/13(Fri)20:10,03/29/13(Fri)20:12,03/29/13(Fri)20:13,03/29/13(Fri)20:17,03/29/13(Fri)20:38,03/29/13(Fri)20:55,03/29/13(Fri)20:58,03/29/13(Fri)21:06,03/29/13(Fri)21:13,03/29/13(Fri)23:07,03/30/13(Sat)12:29,03/30/13(Sat)13:39,03/30/13(Sat)14:36,03/30/13(Sat)19:47,03/30/13(Sat)20:31,03/30/13(Sat)20:32,03/31/13(Sun)14:34,03/31/13(Sun)15:25,03/31/13(Sun)15:27,03/31/13(Sun)15:27,03/31/13(Sun)15:29,03/31/13(Sun)15:30,03/31/13(Sun)15:35,03/31/13(Sun)15:37,03/31/13(Sun)15:38,03/31/13(Sun)15:41,03/31/13(Sun)15:44,03/31/13(Sun)16:00,03/31/13(Sun)16:04,03/31/13(Sun)16:09,03/31/13(Sun)16:14,03/31/13(Sun)16:22,03/31/13(Sun)16:24,03/31/13(Sun)16:28,03/31/13(Sun)16:34,03/31/13(Sun)16:40,03/31/13(Sun)16:50,03/31/13(Sun)16:55,03/31/13(Sun)17:07,03/31/13(Sun)19:54","Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"

"WWE has plenty of cruiserweights, most of them don't even get screen-time, let alone job, and there's an entire show (Superstars or even Main Event) they could shine in. So why not just make a fucking cruiserweight division & title for them?,WWE probably doesn't want to emphasise the vanilla midget-ness of their current product,Cody Rhodes is cruiserweight? I always thought he was quite built,He is, and is fairly tall as well.,you forgot hornswoggle,The old Light Heavyweight Championship had a cutoff of 215. Maybe that would be a better way to go?,Vince nixed the cruiserweight division because Paul London botched a Shooting Star Press and nearly killed someone. He didn't want his roster getting crippled so decided to put a lid on so many guys doing high-risk moves, and since guys doing high-risk moves was the crux of what made the crusierweight title scene so exciting and unique, he thought her might as well drop the whole division. No-one's going to pay to watch slow simple heavyweight-style matches as done by manlets.,Personally, I don't want it back. A cruiserweight 'divison' is just an excuse to corral all of the small guys into their own playpen and keep them away from the actually worthwhile championships. Were the cruiserweight title around back in the day, Ricky Steamboat might never have won the IC title. Were it around today, Bryan might never have got his WHC run. They would have just been shoved into the midget division so that big burly meatbags could continue to monopolize the important parts of the show. I do't give a shit about half the guys on that list, and the better half are the cream that will rise to the top in time anyway.,Also, you wrote Sin Cara twice.,Could have sworn that was Kidman.,Hmmm, is there a YouTube clip of this? I have no memory of it.,It was Kidman, leaped too far and caught Chavo with a knee in the side of the head and was unconscious for 5 minutes in the ring. They kayfabe'd it and made it so Kidman was scared of doing the SSP from then on, eventually turning heel against the aforementioned Paul London.,Can someone tell me when they retired it?,It seems to me it died right about when legit girl fightin died.,Here, Kidman's botch.,Forgot link:,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mx,...sounds reasonable.,Again, another avenue for TNA. And again, they squandered it. If only they hadnt went full retard when ECW came back on.,Anyone else think ECW was a ploy to assist the murder of TNA along with getting Hogan and Russo overthere?,Yeah but its hard to beleive the midget guys can beat the heavyweights.,Make the Heavyweight have a minimum weight, and make the Intercontinental and WWE Championship open to all.,Anoyher problem of the giant guys, is that nobody believed it when anyone smaller than Orton beat him.,And honestly, Sheamus would destroy Punk or Bryan.,The cruiserweight division is a bad idea and you should feel bad for wanting it back,I don't care about what's 'believable'. I'd be watching 2-minute long MMA main events if I did. I watch wrestling to get away from all of that boring realism shit and let my imagination have some breathing room. It's fiction, and having the underdog overcome great odds through honed skill & determination is a classic story. David vs Goliath is damn inspirational.,Plus, it's not like a truly talented cruiserweight will start trying to throw a heavyweight around the ring in a match like they're the same size. They have way of getting around the handicap and making it look & feel more legitimate. Daniel Bryan ducks & weaves and picks his shots carefully. Rey Mysterio's offense centers around using the opponent's mass against them. Punk was beat by the bigger, stronger Cena several times at MitB, but the crowd gave him a superhuman toughness boost and he kept on kicking out of stuff that should have honestly pinned him. Size isn't the be-all-end-all variable in a fight.,If it helps, look at it like this: there are countless midgets on the indies who never make it to WWE and who would get squashed in an instant by a WWE heavyweight, because they're baseline. Maybe the smaller guys who are indeed on the roster are able to hang with the bigger guys because they are especially tenacious & especially skilled at wrestling. Maybe Sheamus simply isn't as tough or talented as Bryan pound-for-pound, and would get beaten by him easily if they were the same size.,The midget held it last, then got it vacated and no match to crown a new champ ever happened,I remember reading Raymond Stereo's book and him saying how he heard ""David and Goliath"" pretty much every time they planned matches for him,A good idea in practice, but their high flying moves would be to a minimum, since they were the leading cause of injuries for a lot of superstars.,Honestly, I think the best bet would be to make one like a Light Heavyweight, or hell even make the Million Dollar Belt something worth fighting for.,Make it so they have a division and title worth fighting for and feuding over, but one that doesn't require them taking on the big boys they aren't positioned or built to handle; none of the expect OFF THE TOP ROPE, THROUGH TABLES things of Cruiserweights.,Probably should put a 24/7 rule on them, so they're never not on TV for extended periods of time.,These guys are great going against each other, not so great against the Shaymooses, Cenas and Ortons. Giving them their own division is a smart idea, but I think Cruiserweights have taken their course.,While we're at it give more belts to the divas, I mean I love eyecandy as much as they next guy, but they can be sexy and tough too.,Let those bitches wrestle and stop wasting my RAW with 1 minute of screaming, slapping and roll ups.,BRING BACK THE WOMEN'S TAG TEAM!,I would rather they drop the Diva's title and go back to it being the Womens Championship; and there being actual wrestling ala Lita.,If we keep it to one title they just face the same problem where some of them aren't good enough to get it, and it becomes just an accessory for the new flavor of the month.,The women's division getting more titles would mean that they would have to work on the product.,But lol we are arguing in a perfect world scenario, so yours would work too.,you love the beaner,Actually, if I remember correctly.,I remember reading that Jim Ross had said that a lot of the wrestlers would rather not be labeled as a ""crusierweight"" as it really locks them out of a lot of opportunities.,So for the actual wrestlers, I guess its actually a blessing to have the crusierweight division gone.",,"03/30/13(Sat)17:44,03/30/13(Sat)17:46,03/30/13(Sat)17:47,03/30/13(Sat)17:51,03/30/13(Sat)17:58,03/30/13(Sat)18:17,03/30/13(Sat)18:31,03/30/13(Sat)18:34,03/30/13(Sat)18:52,03/30/13(Sat)19:12,03/30/13(Sat)19:29,03/30/13(Sat)19:38,03/30/13(Sat)19:38,03/30/13(Sat)19:42,03/30/13(Sat)19:47,03/30/13(Sat)19:51,03/30/13(Sat)20:55,03/31/13(Sun)23:19,03/31/13(Sun)23:25,03/31/13(Sun)23:39,03/31/13(Sun)23:41,03/31/13(Sun)23:55,04/01/13(Mon)00:07,04/01/13(Mon)00:15,04/01/13(Mon)00:25","Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Something Witty,Something Witty,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Something Witty,Something Witty,Something Witty,Something Witty,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Flight of the Goat Face , ,03/31/13(Sun)23:39 ,Flight of the Goat Face,!!EHNRgG8FLi2,Flight of the Goat Face , ,03/31/13(Sun)23:41 ,Flight of the Goat Face,!!EHNRgG8FLi2,Anonymous,Anonymous,Flight of the Goat Face , ,04/01/13(Mon)00:07 ,Flight of the Goat Face,!!EHNRgG8FLi2,Jim Profit,Jim Profit,Anonymous,Anonymous"

"Snooker is played using a cue and 22 snooker balls: one white cue ball, 15 red balls worth one point each, and six balls of different colours: yellow (2 points), green (3), brown (4), blue (5), pink (6) and black (7). Whenever a red ball is potted, the shooter is allowed to pot one of the colours. If successful, they score the value of the colour potted, and it is returned to its correct position on the table. This process continues until they fail to pot the desired ball, at which point their opponent comes back to the table to play the next shot. The game continues in this manner until all the reds are potted and only the 6 colours are left on the table; at that point the colours must be potted in the order from least to most valued ball - that is, yellow first (because smallest value of 2 points), then green (3 points), brown (4 points), blue (5 points), pink (6 points) and finally black (7 points), with the balls not being returned to play. When the final ball is potted, the player with more points wins. Maximum score is 147, if you pot red-black-red-black (and so on) and clean up other colors from the table. A regular (full-size) table is 12 × 6 ft (3.7 × 1.8 m). Snooker is primarily a game of controlling the cue ball. Everything rests on good positioning for the next shot.,Some of the more famous players are: Stephen Hendry, Ronnie O'Sullivan, Steve Davis, Jimmy White, John Higgins, Mark Williams, Ray Reardon, Alex Higgins...,Most proficient tournament winner is Hendry, with 36 titles, followed by Davis (28), Higgins (25) and O'Sullivan (24). O'Sullivan is usually praised as the most ""naturally gifted"" player ever, but that is debatable.,World Championship starts 20th of April.,Currently, China Open Tournament is on, and in the final Neil Robertson of Australia is leading Mark Selby of England 6-4, in a race to 10.,pic is me, i'm 6ft3 (1.90m), to give you perspective on the size of the table.,that cloth looks like shit. needs a good block. that china open was fucking good though, i loved watching neil win.",Snooker,"03/31/13(Sun)08:53,04/01/13(Mon)16:31","Anonymous,Snooker,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"

And he probably will make another run at the title. But then..Triple H vs Cena for the title? That really doesn't make too much sense.,No one wants Haitch on TV. ,i highly doubt based haitch will have another run. hes busy trying to save THIS BUSINESS from his senile father in-law.,True.,I can't help but want to see him on tv more though.,B-but I want Vince's doofus son-in-law to have the gold again.,I don't use Steam and I don't know how to get into the group chat. I am not buying shit. SOMEONE HELP THE GAYDA,Guys, I made some gifs,I think I'm going to sleep through the first hour of RAW, unless Trish is planned for tonight. Then I am pushing through,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct_v,You just go to the group page on steam and click ""Enter Chat"" on the right :P,I'd be happy for Haitch to be on TV, even hold a title again, if it led to a feud with a midcarder and that midcarder being put over.,Chances of that happening are under 1% though..,This is what happens,He doesn't put people over though. He's pretty much like the Undertaker at this point- A legend that the WWE brings out to sell tickets and PPVs.,Who's the /asp/ champion again?,Fandango will win if he has a fight in tonights raw,Jericho,this is new. Just get a free game like TF2. I don't think you even need to install it.,Jericho.,Hence why I said,I tried that. It still gives me that,cause im into fitness and i think its cool to watch how guys prepare for matches ..... and it gives me ideas of what to incorporate into my workouts,<inb4 its gay to watch men workout ,this is a wrestling board im sure we've all had that friend that has said it was gay to watch so you can understand,fucked that greentxt up,I get you.,noooo well ok then,I just read AJ Lee's WithLeather interview where she talked about video games. She has excellent taste. Add that to her yandere hotness and you get a 8/10 would date.,Tensai was the definition of getting buried last year until he managed to save himself.,Zack Ryder is buried. Someone who loses a match in 30 seconds is not buried.,I'll buy a $5 game,But he will be on tonight.

Is it R-Truth still?,Jericho,If Johnny Ace appears, it'll save this RAW.,cesaro has a Yodel Gimmick now ugh he yodels before he goes to the ring its so embarssing,Seriously? It is Jericho?

He might cheat to win or attack The Rock after the match.,thx m8,Cena will still be World Champion, don't even consider the Rock,Cena is I guess, the new Hulk Hogan? He's never going to be taken out of the top ranking. I don't follow wrestling anymore, but I guess that's who Cena is the rough equivalent of these days? I remember when Cena was a mid-tier face back in the 2003-2005 era. That's when WWE still had Divas that did more than be eye-candy. ,I remember there was a match where if Tori Wilson or whatever lost she had to shave off her hair. The storylines used to be better too. Or maybe I just grew out of WWE.,Nah, he's far worse than that. Hulk wasn't on TV every week doing his thing.,Well, not in WWF at least.,Is Trish Stratus confirmed for last night? I really want to know. I am fucking tired,<<<you take things,You>seem like a really fun guy to be ,He's been the new Hogan for the longest.,I have no idea.,I feel like tonight is going to be a shit show, the least they could do is give some guys from NXT a shot mainly pic related,u r really fun m8 xddddddddddddddddd,This is /b/-like posting,It's always a shit show m8.,What happened?

If they both got injured for a long time, it'd be the best thing for WWE.,Yes.,guys, the raw thread belongs on /sp/ tonight. that place is ours, don't let those fucks from /sp/ win when half of them do nothing but shitpost 9/10 of the time anyway.,this,CM PENK,We have a board specifically for wrassling (and other alternative sports) now,i post in the one on /sp/ because it gets more posts,What is with those guys and wrestling all the sudden,seriously in the last month or so they've made at least one reference to WWF/E in like every video.,Road to Wrestlemania gets people excited, I guess.,I still post in the /sp/ one it just isn't active until the show starts though.This place is full of autistic people and /wooo/ losers,I wish I could get excited about it. :(,I remember when it was built up as the most important thing in WWE,Me too Gayda....me too.,Welp, it looks like the /asp/ vs /sp/ stuff has started again.,Who needs build up when you've got the main event of four Wrestlemania's in a row already set?,God damn it. /sp/ links their fucking threads on here,This feud needs to end. It isn't even GOAT,I hope this RAW is half decent,BRB power nap,TNA and WWE aren't even on the same level,It won't be.,Honestly i'm at a point where I only watch Raw (and only raw, aside from the occasional PPV, including wrasslemania even though nothing on the card interests me right now) every other week since I know there's a 80% chance I'll miss nothing of note.,The recap the shit out of everything too,I have that one, but CENAWINSLOL is still the free space. And I'm keeping it that way.,Nah we're more like the ECW to WCW and WWE,Can't we be more like PWG?,I changed it to ,CENAWINSLOL hasn't happened in a while . Buried happens every week,I don't know that,It was the show with all the flippy guys.

Could be better,Whatever makes you happy. I want Bingos tonight. Cena hasn't won in a while,It definitely hasn't been good. I can't really give a number though.,I actually agree with this guy. Strongly. This card is fucking stupid. ,The movies have been out for awhile. They'll stop because they need to promote WM. Waste of a spot. ,The card is already made. Was any effort put into this bingo card?,Guy might not even make an appearance due to the kayfabe broken ankle. ,Seriously, the fuck is this? Can we just remove 'buried' from cards in general? A lot of morons on this board, and /sp/, don't know what 'buried' even means. ,Sounds about right. They know what the card should be, but no idea how to get there. Hell, if it weren't for them being able to turn a bad situation to their advantage I wouldn't buy the Taker-Punk build up at all.,Make your own card then sexy.,2,4 at best,Just got home from work. I'll do one next week.,He kinda won last week in the after-show when Sheamus and Rybck saved him from a Shield Bomb.,If Ricardo shows up in spite of the angle, he'd be pretty based.,They will keep pushing movies,I'll change that,Changed that,It happens way more often than CENAWINSLOL, Cena hasn't had a match in a while,I could see it happen if he maybe comes out in a wheel chair. But then again, it's WWE Creative. He'd probably have him limp out or some stupid shit.,Hahahaha,No luck for Cesaro?,He was just on Smackdown,Also, you picked a horrible example to show what buried doesn't mean.,Marking in NCIS, the URN was shown!,RAW THREAD,RAW THREAD,RAW THREAD,RAW THREAD,RAW THREAD,More cards...more silliness..more fun.,I'VE BEEN IN THE DANGER ZONE,THEY KNOW,4,I'VE BEEN IN THE DANGER ZONE,Did he just say

"[D A T B A C K F I R E ' S D A I L Y A I R S H I T T H R E A D],Older thread is AUTOSAGING.,Getting a WELL R-4 MP7 next week for £30. Can't fucking wait.,Already switched from 2l bottles to cans just for shit to shoot when I get it and also gonna buy a couple of mags and maybe a cheap red dot/holographic sight with the spare dosh I'll have.,Good shit. I just got my G36K re-assembled for some games tomorrow after turning the blowback on again. It's finally going to be positive in temperature here and that means that this poor thing won't be struggling to fire full auto.,I've played with it in the winter with nearly negative eight degrees celsius, and the rof was horrid because of the cold. My friends' m4s didn't get slowed down at all however. any ideas on what could have caused this?,I'm using an Intellect Ni-MH 1600mAH 9.6v battery.,What batteries were your friends using? IIRC, lipos are less effected, and Ni-Cads actually produce heat while running, so they might be less effected.,They too use Ni-MH I think, 1600mAH 9.6v. My gun does have an open area at the bottom of the grip though, where the motor is housed. Their m4s have it closed. Could it be that my motor simply gets too cold?,Interesting that you have problems with Full auto in the cold. I airshit in the winter all the time up near the Canadian border, and none of my Ni-MH batteries have too much problems turning out full auto. Even my SRC G36C could before I sold it.,This is the reason why I use electric guns, at least you have some idea when they will run out and that they can run in more conditions than gas guns. Seriously, gas guns have punch but for fuck;s sake, one mag and you're done.,Also mid-caps > high caps,I live in London, Ontario and the temperatures here were brutal. I noticed that others guns slowed down a bit too, but not to the extent of mine. Oh well, it's over now so I'm happy. Oh and by the way my gun is an ARES G36k (AR-005 as they call it due to copyright).,fat fuck detected,0/10 would not operate with,You can totally tell under the vest and chest rig can't you.,Do you do style rules like if you got shot in the leg you have to limp and such?,That sounds fucking fun.,Whatever you say little guy. ,D:,I've done it before, it is fun, like if you get shot by a sniper, you kinda fall down on the ground and act like you got shot in the leg. It sounds faggoty at first, but believe me, it is actually really fun,,the fuck,i'm in alberta and this is from a game less than 48 hours ago,this is one of my mates.,I think it would be more feasible like in a game with just your friends, where you could just play around. Though that could be fun at an op where the players are class based, kind of like ACA.,6/10 sorry, had to deduct a point for saying fuck gas masks,Well if you get a large group of people and some way to ref people, and punish people for not following those rules, then I think it could work,But that sounds like faggotry, but I've tried it before, it's actually fun and adds some extra tension.,Gas masks were issued at a zombie game my mate played at.,What patches do you guys wear? I wear a flag but not much else.,I wouldn't wear any patch that is a military rank/patch.,All I really wear are flag patches for now. Some others wear their callsign for their teams/team patches/and gag patches,Please no. Absolute trash.,Until airsoft range gets to 300-500 meters, real caps will always be impractical for anything other than CQB.,Just ordered a G&G M100 spring to put in my gun to lower that shit down to CQB legality. Springfield, here I come. Until then I suppose I can keep ""playing"" with the three friends I have, and their clear plastic springers. :I,My flag and the Red Sabre patch from Takedown.,mein neger,Did you attach yours to velcro? I want to do mine like that but it'll be a pain since it's got that iron-on shit on the back.,First time poster. Here's a story.,Was a tense moment, that.,Former airsofter here, getting back into the sport after 3 years of break. Bought a second hand G&G M16A3 with tweaked internals clocking at 460fps for about $200 worth of slav currency.,Can't wait to get back into it. Been a long time. I wonder if I still have the hang of it.,It's not easy to forget. Especially if you were the type that practiced, then it's all reflex and instinct really.,Well, I wouldn't say I was the most disciplined and trained player...,Eh, we'll see. I can't do worse than a total newbie, right?,... Right?,Nah I didn't. I sewed it on because why the hell not. Didn't really want to iron my soft shell jacket.,/k/omrade here.,Do any of you guys use gun-safety with your airshit? (Trigger discipline, muzzle discipline?),Why/Why not?,Are you sure it's not the grease in the gearbox freezing and slowing rof?,I do because I've had a gas gun build enough pressure in an empty mag from temperature change to fire and I have seen an aeg that Fired wile the battery was removed because the piston was locked back and slipped forward firing the gun. ,Fucking no one else does not even airsoft store owners.,That's stupid, trigger discipline and muzzle control should be observed on everything that fires projectiles.,Disregard me. YOU have it cold as fuck.,Sounds like a fun event.,What were the objectives?,/k/ here, I have trigger discipline with a fucking drill.,What are good brands for airsoft? Extreme beginner here, looking for inspiration,What's everyones opinion sights?,Thanks m8,so know of anyone in the kitchener cambridge area who plays? im trying to break into the game got myself a aeg and would like to try a game or two with a few easygoing guys.,How's the D-Boys RK03?,Man these threads used to be so active. I have some good news. I did a couple rounds of FFA at a friend's place today. It was only me and three other guys but man, it felt good to bust the gear out.,/k/,My nigga,I have trigger discipline for EVERYTHING,Do any of you guys use RDS IR EOtech on your guns?,It becomes such a habit. I'm glad I have it.,Anyone have the UAR? How is it?,I meant to say ""or"",dat bullpup style,looks neat,My whole team does. For security reasons, mainly. If one of those bb lands on your eye, it is not going to be funny.,Right.,Yes, it's just a good habit to have.,No sadly, I don't really need one since I just use a G&P shotgun. But I would like one just for looks at least.,I'm okay with this habit. Plus it puts a good name for Airshitters. Since so many of us get a bad rep from dumb fucks.,Did i do alright for my first AEG?,You did excellent,sup.,Just migrating here from the other thread.,pic is of a teammate.,Man, Sergeant Fatass needs to lay off some of those MREs.,In my group our games are at this point all 20 man super team vs my 3-5 man squad and whoever shows up with some favoritism to the super team. We've got a big ass storyline series going for this year more or less and it's kinda feeling like a bit of a screwjob. Best part is our team lore was decided by people not a part of our squad. They've decided our team in and out of story is US operatives and they're a terrorist cell, but the squad agreed on essentially something to the tune of a completely unaffiliated hacker cell with gear and guns. I'm thinking about completely fucking up the storyline by completing our objective and ""firing a ballistic missile"" that we are supposed to disable after redirecting it via props we bring and don't tell about. I'll have a legit chance to do this as a kind of payback for deciding things that were ours to decide, not theirs. If we do this right it'll force a change in the storyline.,Now the question is, should I?,i never understood why most of the people that are into military stuff aren't into the fitness part of it,well, i dont know about the one on that photo, but i have seen guys that look fat running like hell and moving pretty fast.,And besides, he may just be a geardo, or maybe he just does not give a fuck about being decent at airsoft and is just there for the urr durr of it.,who knows.,It's always puzzled me how people can be fat and doing things of the nature you encounter in combat sports. Same with fat cops... wtf.,I need to start getting fit, scrawny ass arms are not that great for using a big ass LMG.,in-game perspective, the orders given to you where issued by your government, so you must follow them.,You have a few options.,Follow the plan laid for you, and simply try to outperform everyone. they are probably thinking that, since u guys are a small squad, u are bad players. prove your worthiness.,Tell them that you are not going to play a game where you have not decided nothing. Try to reach an agreement on what your mission should be.,If you simply say nothing and try to fuck their storyline, they will simply kick you out of the game, probably full of rage (AKA shooting full auto to the head),Not nearly enough JG on that list. JG guns are rocking. You can use JG gears to run DSG builds and shit, no worries. Their motors are some of the best PERIOD and their pistons are better than most stock stuff.,We serve no man or government, just ourselves and the squad. We (the squad) agreed on this and then they decided to tell us what we are before we could tell them the lore and before this story thing even happened. The whole idea is essentially we take back our squad ""story"" at least. It wasn't just that they decided, it was everything even though we're supposed to be independent of their team while still under the same umbrella of the whole airsofting group.,We've already defeated them in a big field game, first story game of the series. Our problem usually we get stuck with any other people who show up (most cases just enough arrive to get numbers close). Usually they don't take orders at all, are completely new to the game, or just flat don't know that's going on. There is one guy who usually shows up who is fucking amazing, but otherwise we get screwed in numbers and collective skill. Team balance usually sucks bad when one team is mostly made up of the leftovers.,At the very least I'm going to request that we get the squad leaders together for all involved squads to rewrite some of this because when it's all set up by the big super team instead of a neutral party some favoritism is almost guaranteed.,The sudden change would be something that might be appreciated though, throw a wildcard into the mix. Something unexpected. Besides, if they didn't like it then oh well, we still accomplished our main goals for the mission anyways even if the new target and launch is ignored we still have to capture the location.,Well, I've learned my lesson. Never order anything from Evike or anyone using USPS. It's the shittiest postal service in the world.,Usually goes good for me, though you have to order on a monday or tuesday or olse you get to wait a week regardless,I work in biological cleanup, would i be a faggot if I got this?,US flag (soon to accompany Gadston flag on other shoulder and ""ΜΟΛΩΝ ΛΑΒΕ"" under it), blood type for if I get seriously injured while playing. Also working on designing a custom team patch I'm going to get made.,Michganfag here, we played every week this winter.,Yes.,Don't know if this is the place to ask, but I got $1000 and I want a new airsoft gun. Wat do?,do you already have camo, a mask, a molle vest, pouches, and an idea of the role you want to play?,Well, let's do this step by step. What class of gun do you want? ie. Assault rifle, sniper, DMR, LMG, etc.,Then, what powerplant do you want? GG/propane, CO2, Electric, or Spring?,Important thing to remember, a high quality assault rifle can be just as good as an LMG for the role with the right accessories. I run a $400 VFC Mk18 AEG with bipod foregrip and an electric winding box mag. Thing works like a charm for assault and gunner roles.,Absolutely. It's still a gun even though it shoots plastic bbs. You can still injure someone with irresponsible handling. Besides, if you're use to it with your airsoft gun youll do it out of habit when handling the real thing.,A lot of noobs think camo == stealth,It's just a tool to help with it. I wear OD khakis and a brown t-shirt w/ a black chest rig; and my face mask is (very shittily) painted green with some brown on it. ,I've been in situations where the enemy team has passed by me 5 feet to my left and did not notice my presence.,It reaaally helps to have camo if you do outdoors play. It's saved my ass plenty. Nothing like having 5 guys walk right past you without noticing you and then opening up on them when they though nobody was there.,Well, what role are you interested in playing? Gunner? Sniper? Assault? DM? Grenadier?,I just wore dark clothing and sat still to the exact same affect you described.,That's awesome, I'd still rather have my camo than none, the one time I had a black helmet on that's the only place I got shot. After that game the people on the other team told me that damn helmet is how they saw me every single time, otherwise I wasn't visible for the most part because I play in an area where the environment is nearly the same as the intended area of use. My friend in a sweatshirt and jeans got lit the fuck up. Indoors it doesn't matter for shit unless there's a lot of shadowy areas.,If someone were to dress up as pic related and play airsoft at one of your games, what do you think would go through your mind?,Im a Michigander too.,Are you into aircraft?,FUCKIN SWEET, but easy target. If you're confident in your cospaly gear to play airsoft in it it had better be quality stuff. I eventually want to get stormtrooper armor and rig up a sterling AEG and then rig that into an E-11.,I'd hope I remembered the basics of CQC.,His gear basically looks like full body motorcycle armor and a headband and molle vest. I think its pretty sturdy.,Shoot up every cardboard box on sight,Depends on who made it. I know there's a company that makes plenty of suits like this, I don't know if they make this MGS full bodysuit though. Plenty of cosplayers do not make their outfit for functionality, just looks.,in outdoor games, I couldn't hit shit because I was using clearshit. 230fps.,lately I upgraded to a Velocity Arms MP5A3, which runs at 310fps. Still not all that great for outdoor use, but I was raping people's face masks with it in CQB in toronto.,I think he was referring to the fact that Stormtroopers never hit anything,These blast points are to accurate for sandpeople, only imperial stormtroopers are so precise.,So long as you're not important to the story I'll waste you.,I'd keep an eye out for cardboard boxes and probably have a giggle at the fake mustache/queer octocamo suit but otherwise cool guy.,hello fellow airsofter's This is my first time on /asp/ and its nice to meet you all,I got a few stories. I sent a kid to the hospital once with my pistol. ,and last week I caught a little Niger trying to steal my gun,If you managed to acquire a functional Stirling AEG but then took the steps to turn it into a blaster, you'd have severely rustled my jimmies for not doing an old school Brit loadout just so you could harass members anyone on your field that claims to be Irish.,I'd think he's a fucking faggot and proceed to shoot him.,Niger... the country?,What are some good blowback Ak's that /asp/ would recommend? Budget doesn't matter.,Daytonagun is the only way.,I don't think so. At least you've got a reason to get it.,Fucking airsoft thieves. I think every time I've gone to my field somebody gets something stolen.,Doesn't P* make one too?,P* isn't blowback.,Daytonagun is the best option for a blowback AK with an external air rig, and external air rig is the best way to go for blowback.,What kind of clothing is he wearing? I'm really interested.,gorka suit,Is there a way to make speedball style airsoft feel more operator? There are no milsims that I know of in my area.,GBB non-faggot race,Stare at his ass.,Its like you're actively trying to be a massive faggot,There's nowhere to go for milsim, I feel fucked in the ass by circumstance.,but you must tell them about yout new objectives rigth as the game starts, not even 5 minutes into it. otherwise, you are just trolling them.,Hmm, so let me clarify something. The only airsoft guns that simulate actual cycling are blowback?,Yes. Maybe AEP and bolt-actions too.,Yeah, but it's hard to play ""mil-sim"" if you'd have been barred from joining the military in the first place.,Why is external air rig better?,Try not to do shit you wouldn't do if you were actually getting shot at.,Does rain really have any effect on AEGs? Going to an open play on sunday, never really airsofted in the rain.,No, all electric components are insulated so unless you completely submerged it in water it should be fine.,Jesus, that's expensive. What makes this one so superior?,Just a heads up anon, you don't want to try to run Starmtrooper armor for Airsoft... the problem with most of the stormtrooper kits is they are WAY, WAY too fucking fragile.,Now, Mandolorian stuff... made out of Sentra or even metal, could be fine. And most of the helmet's are decent [and easily modifiable to install metal mesh visors.] But the storm trooper stuff is right out due to the fragile nature of the armor in general. You'd break something the first time you tried to take cover in Trooper armor.,stormtrooper^,Some BB warz footage from last weekend,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBXz,It runs off of an external airsource, the blowback is more significant than gas-in-mag guns, it's a very good system.,You can probably pick up a used kit for much cheaper.,Vacuform plastic the helmet, wear protection underneath it.,Look like a bad motherfucker running around in a battle damaged helmet.,Don't give a fuck since vacuforming is cheap and easy.,I knew a guy who went full agent 47. Got the red tie suit, shaved his head and two silver 1911's. Even went so far as to get two of these and placed them on his back underneath the jacket.,That's why I'd be making it myself with stronger materials if at all possible. If not I'd imagine proper materials would just make it more expensive. I'd kill for a steel set of Mandalorian with a ballistic resistant lens and a good venting method. Would be amazing to rig up the jetpack to be a big ass hopper with gas and bbs to make the ""flamethrower"" actually work.,It's not that intrusive really, just a scope on he top and some thermal vents of whatever you call them around the barrel. Would be pretty bitchin to get it to play the sounds too lol. As for doing a brit loadout instead of a stormie, no thanks, need to get some WWII GI gear so I can look awesome with my Thompson though.,Vacuform a helmet in two halves, coat each one in epoxy, put another vacuformed piece over it while the epoxy's wet,repeat until solid as fuck structure, join pieces,vacuforming is fucking sweet really.,But why would he get one of those? 47 never used one except for that one mission in Silent Assassin, and that was only viable when coupled with the Ninja outfit.,Oh and the one in Absolution, but I refuse to acknowledge that as a Hitman game.,Was one of them short ones he used in the movie when fighting the other hitmen. All inconsistencies aside, it shit-up the tacticool guys, change scares them.,A wakizashi.,But really...,Yeah, nah.,I've got a cold steel bokken I wear on my back in a shotgun scabbard occasionally, though cant really use it because I could really fuck someone up with it or potentially destroy a gun. Planning on making a boffer sword to use instead though. That way I can let loose a good swing for a kill with no worries.,any WW2 lovers here?,I recently just bought i thompson and absolutely love the thing? and ideas for mods to it or anyhing along the lines of that?,King arms? I love mine, I just don't have any mags for it. Millions of M-4 mags, one mags or two for anything else I have.,Lel,It's not very practical, and my goddamn targeting system doesn't even work.,Looks like one of those crappy toy things from walmart tbh. Metal or nothing when it comes to having full mando armor to play in.,Yeah king arms...shoots harder than any thompson ive ever owned..i bought 10 mid caps when i bought it..i love the thing..im working on getting WW2 ranger gear right now but its expensive,CoH style eh?,""Spray and pray! it's the SMG way."",WELL THEN,i play CoH al the time...im addicted to WW2 looking in to buying a gas blowback carbine and the new m1 Garand that just came out...ordering a PPSH tomorrow,You cannot deny you'd look like a total badass in full steel or aluminum Mandalorian armor while playing. Plastic mando armor just feels... wrong.,Is the A&K LR-300 a good gun? A bro of mine works at a retailer and can get me a nice discount as they have one last piece.,They're solid. Not top tier, but solid.,Plus the LR-300 is S.T.A.L.K.E.R. as fuck, comrade.,Worst case scenario you resell it and probably break even or profit with the discount.,Is it the SR or the ML?,I want a dmr/sniper rifle that is different. Price is no object, neither is fps limitations.,Why would they do this? Their just encouraging them.,I'd probably go for the KJW 10/22. It's sexy as fuck.,Because as we've established, Evike is the Gamestop of airsoft,YFW,This isn't your first is it? ,I know it's still going to be shooting a 6mm pellet but what makes that not a random as shit choice?,Because it's an airsoft rifle. Not a real gun. And if I see another faggot wielding an SVD I will choke a bitch.,What the fuck purpose does a 10/22 airshit replica serve? Who's the target demographic for it? It's not a military rifle, so it's not like you're pretending to shoot people with an AK or whatever, and it's more expensive than a real one. Who would want this?,Sorry, /k/ommando here. Still getting used to the whole airsoft-actually-has-a-place-now deal.,If I had a friend who said he wanted a gun for $100 or less, what should I buy him? He seems interested in airsoft and it's his birthday soon.,The best spring sniper you can get that's under a Benjamin. For $100 you're going to get a low-end AEG-same with gas. No, he won't be charging the front lines or CQB-ing with it, but actually using tactics and brain power to flank people and pop one in their neck is pretty satisfying.,I addressed that if you read the post again. I still don't understand the choice. And what's wrong with SVDs anyway?,Every DMR/sniper and their mom uses an SVD.,Pistol in off hand, sword in main. Not entirely melee.,Are you a victim of a botched eye operation or a Russkie?,No.,You can pick up a cyma AEG for JUST over that and it'll allow the guy to decide he wants to play himself instead of limiting him.,Ah, fair enough. It's all ARs with silly/overkill optics in this country. You almost never see a competent SVD user. ,So shoot him? Meh, different strokes for different folks I guess. ,wat,I don't think I'll be able to get into this hobby anytime soon.,Because those two groups are the only people that would willingly use that hateful looking thing.,I've charged people with my pistol and been fucked because I was out of ammo with everything when I could have got in sword range if I had one.,If it upsets you more when it tags you out then that's even better.,Well, that was silly.,I've never been hit by any DMR actually. Mostly because they hang out 100 meters from where the action is and hope that someone walks in to their sights.,I urge you to visit us in Europe at the nearest opportunity then.,I am in Europe.,The why on earth are you up and where the hell do you play it sounds like your guys are shit. Not taking a shot at you personally, if you're not getting hit by them cool but if they're just not scoring hits then damn...,I want the Bell Mauser c96, but it seems everyone's sold out, or it's only from Hong Kong, who charges ridiculously for 1-month shipping.,DRM? i am unfamiliar with this term.,Designated Marksman Rifle, basically the gap between infantry rifles and sniper rifles.,buying a 100 sniper is like buying a 200 dollar netbook.,It IS a computer, but you cant do shit whit it.,get him a KJ WORKS gbb pistol.He wont really be able to play only whit that, but its a starter, and at least it wont fall to pieces in 2 weeks.,Because all DRM players are the same.,DMR stands for designated marksman rifle/role. People have started using the term more in airsoft since the US started deploying 'marksmen' attached to fire teams. In airsoft, it's usually just a sniper who cannot into bolt action skills or a normal player who cannot into CQB and so decides to be a ""marksman"".,So I called your DMR/sniper players shit and then... You also called your DMR/sniper players shit. Right, ok. ,While we're at it, most of my friends I team up with usually don't switch off from semi auto, maybe we're just running a different kind of gun to you.,Not all. On my team, snipers lead the way, because they have more range and better vision. we go around 30-100 meters (depending on the situation) behind them, and they go alone and check. if they see something, they radio us, and wait for us to get there. then they engage and we follow up.,the real problem is the guys who try to apply every single real military tactitc to airsoft. it doesnt work that way.,Nor does my team (im ,) full auto is simply not worth it. it is better to get semi and shoot carefully than spray and pray.,feelsgoodman.jpg,But that's actually wrong. At any distance over 40 meters with a gun that shoots sub, like 500 FPS, semi-auto is just an exercise in futility because you can literally just dodge the ""bullets"".,Gotta disagree with the no UTG on the sniper section there. Been running with their L96 (Maruzen clone) for 5 year now with the only problem being that the trigger box cracked a year after I put a sp170 in there. It's only $30 for a replacement metal box and the sears on both of them are still holding up. I'm currently shooting 545fps with a 2fps deviation (because of an old spring) and have had 5 350ft or farther kills with it. I have about $850 into it over a period of 5 years.,You need to purchase a better AEG. I literally don't understand how you're not managing unless you're using sub-par hardware. I mean shit, you can doge rounds inside 10 meters if you know what you're doing but not every time. If you can dodge rounds with impunity like you say, surely you're better to pick your position and time your shots rather than just fire more shots.,Managing what? I have a Magpul Masada which is pretty great. We were talking about semiauto at a distance here. Semi is great at closer range when you don't want to waste bullets and you know you've got a shot. But at range? Please.,Fuck yes. ND'ed twice with my sniper. Once when I was an autistic fucktard with barely any weapon experience and no common sense, I shot my brother in between the eyes at 15ft with a 450fps projectile. The other was when I was shimming the trigger and the touch was too light, it fired at the slightest touch. After the first ND I treated the thing like a loaded weapon at all times and have not had another ND in 4 years. Shit scared me when I did that to my bro.,A couple times the guys I charged just had deer in headlights moments when I broke cover running fulls steam at them with nothing but a pistol and a knife (Holy shit, sometimes CoD bs works IRL!). Also only charge guys who get cut off or too close and even then usually only when I'm out of ammo. Sometimes it pays off, sometimes not.,Friend of mine shot his expensive flatscreen because he dicked around with his AEG.,reminds me of my stupid friend who refuses, to this day, to treat airsoft guns with any sort of respect/discipline.,He had a gas blow back pistol, and he took the mag out, and emptied the chamber. He then had the bright idea to put it to this other guy's head and mock-shoot him. Except, there was a BB and somehow gas inside, and it fired. ,He still refuses to stop being a fuckwit, by the way.,Is the A&K SVD AEG any good?,Paintbro here,Don't they have those little BBs that are filled with paint? Why don't you guys use those? How can you really tell when you get someone out?,Where i play. Its L96s, and billions, BILLIONS of M14 type DMRs.,Dude, fellow mo fag here. When ya go let me know. Ill make a trip. However their course is so tight pistols rule.,If its the underfold ak- just no. I had one. Worked for 3 months then died. Great solid body on it though.,Same here, only it was with ,'s story. He took out the mag of his pistol an decocked it, only to play around with it later and shoot his tv.,They do have bb's filled with paint, but they are pretty fragile and with the bb's having a force behind it all the time (the spring mag and the actions of the piston) they don't like to stay intact. Plus they are expensive. You can usually tell if someone is hit by the sound it makes when the bb hits clothing. If they don't call it, just keep on pelting them until they call it. If your sniping and they don't call it, aim for the head or groin, it works.,bro, paintball will ALWAYS trump faggoty airsoft.,basicly, airsoft guns are over-glorified toys, nothing more, nothing less,And then there's this guy.,bro, how's your 50 dollar battery powered bb gun?,Do you really think anyone on this board uses an LPEG for serious play? We're always the fags yet it's the damned paintballers that come in and pull these shenanigans.,HA! Was wondering when one of these fags would show up lol.,Here's a nice steak for you,Why airsoft is better than paintball,I don't understand people like you.,They're different games entirely, the only thing that makes them similar is that they both involve shooting a projectile at someone.,Other than that, they're completely different.,There's no reason to be a faggot about it.,DO NOT GET THE MARUSHON CARBINE. DO NOT GET THE MARUSHIN CARBINE. DO NOT GET THE MARUSHIN CARBINE. ,Biggest piece of shit ever. Get the RA tech conversion for the kjw 10-22,Lancer tactical.,does anyone know of any mauser c96 that are gbb, full metal, and compatible with a short magazine?,all i can find are ones made out of abs plastic or only work with long magazines.,What's the point of that? Why make a replica of a gun that 12 year olds get for christmas? I thought airsoft was about playing with replical Infantry weapons, not plinking guns,like my gear?,been playing for a few years now,Its the only way to get a m1 carbine that isn't pure shit or breaks on the first use.,Jesus Christ.... I would not want to fight you.,haha. Thanks.,TD on everything from windex bottles to my /k/ issued nugget,It'd be nice if the picture wasn't taken out of a dog's anus,Yea I dont have much a camera.,It's not terrible; Its a cheap, reliable gun that you can turn into a outstanding High FPS sharpshooter setup.,You're a big guy.,6'4 240 pounds.,on my ""team"" I carry a m249. mp5, Spas 12. I also carry extra ammo. I guess im the squads assult/packmule,My friend loves airsoft guns, and we dick around with them when we hang out. he mostly gets cheap ones though. I broke one last time we hung out and I feel pretty crappy about it. His birthday is coming up, and I'd like to buy him one to make up for it. Something of better quality I guess. Advice as to what the best companies are?,le rebbit, but this guides actually p. good.,https://docs.google.com/document/pu,I'm pretty sure that's the one that broke on me. Thing is the one he got was only 30 bucks. I assume their pricier stuff is more sturdy?,dont own one myself, my friend owns a canadian legal one though and says its great.,Hey dudes. Thoughts on this?,http://www.airsoftgi.com/mobile/pro,I need something particularly in the $250 range that takes ECHO1 M4 mags. Preferably with a short barrel.,Not if you get a spring sniper. Truthfully a sub-$100 airsoft gun is kinda shitty no matter what kind it is.,What are you trying to achieve with this post?,I think he was talking about the ICS that just came out.,Any Tennessee airsofters?,You guys have never been to Canada in the winter, have you? I was outside in a fucking T-shirt and shorts last week and it was snowing. Snow is not hardcore.,Yes all the time. I have real steel too.,Yes, always.,I learned muzzle and trigger discipline from a young age when my dad learned me to shoot with his break barrel air rifle.,I use it when I fire real firearms at the range.,It angers me when I see people use airsoft with very little regard to safety.,It's all ""lol don't be fag it's just a toy"" until someone ends up with a burst eyeball.,So guys, What camo do you wear when you play im a new england fag so its either 3 color dessert or ACU,Cold affects everything that's rubber in your gun, including the hop up. And if you're using GBBs you're even more fucked.,Does anyone have experience Shark Gear's stuff? i bought MBSS from them and still waiting for it to arrive.,with*,I made the same offer to /k/, and I guess I'll make it here too. Would anyone be interested in some surplus ammo boxes?,They're unmarked .50cal boxes with lids. I'll sell them for $7.50 each.,http://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-vm,I got a couple pics of the boxes.

Didn't know they made tac gear in that size!,anyone know which brand if any of these kinds of hats will actually fit on a normal human being's head? I bought a milspec monkey one and it was a massive disappointment in this respect.,Magpul PTS mids.... Can't go wrong,VFC SCAR H? would you recommend/ currently running a M4 setup? would the 7.62 conversion be worth it?,Of course, the main reason i play airsoft is to practice principles such as this and to practice handling a weapon in a combat situation. I try to focus on these things when engaging targets and operating a close quarters environment. The only thing that can not be practiced is handling the recoil from the weapon. However, I still try to keep a sturdy body position when firing. Like I said, airsoft helps me practice rapid reloading, body position, and trigger/ weapon discipline.,for a pack of 6 its about 20$ more is it worth it?,When I first got them, they jammed occasionally. Me, being pissed, would beat the shit out of them. But the only way to unjam them is to take out the spring, etc. But now that I have used them for a while they are perfect. I even have some that work fine without followers. Not to mention, you can use them to hammer stuff.,Depends. But I'd say no, save up a little more and get the Tokyo Marui instead.,Didn't you try shooting a paintball out of that and it exploded?,Thanks for the advice, I don't really like the blowback action on guns. It's more moving parts to worry about. Never looked into it but it seems like that function would use a good bit of battery as well.,No problem. I can't really comment on the VFC though since I haven't used it, but a friend owns a TM Scar-H and I have to say it's amazing. It's definitely my next buy.,All the time, i ND'd my King Arms M4 GBB once,Fuck yes, I was raised by a soldier. Not some doped out high school drop out redneck.

Stalkers had to collect them and sell them at the ""bar"". Military had to hunt stalkers. The mafia had to make deals with stalkers and make as much money as they could. Stalkers could team up as they wanted and go together -- or set out alone.,Tennessee airsofter reporting in.,Jesus christ why do I play this sport,did you at least frag some charlies,both guns went down in the first game, and I noticed my pistol was like that when I took it out of its holster, never fired a shot.,Holy shit, sorry for how shitty your game went man.,Wow, that's bad luck.

I really just need the exploded view. If anyone can help, awesome, if not, nothing really changes I guess.,anyone know a good place to get accessorys on the cheap?,only place i have found is px-airsoft,Is there an XM8 that isn't a piece of shit? I've been told for years that it's just better to get a G36 (any of them, doesn't matter), and a vague friend of mine had an XM8 with a torn-ass scope.,Why does that remind me of G.M.R's plate carrier?,Did you base it off of theirs?,Oh man, I remember the airsoft crossbow thread. That shit was baller.,The gen. 3 SRCs weren't the WORST things ever. I'd probably rather have one of them than any G36 but that's just preference really.,I want to start acquiring Airsoft gear and shit, but I'm on a budget, what's the absolute starter kit you would recommend to somebody who just wants to give it a try?,CYMA or JG's line of G36s is your best bet.,DON'T skimp out on eye protection, though. Seriously, don't. Look into Uvex I-vo or Bolle glasses. Don't buy no-name chinese crap. Just don't. Please.,Got a new pistol, but evike left out my battle belt in the shipment. I hate that place, but they're pretty cheap and they had it in stock.,An AEG, and eye protection is the bare minimum.,Don't get a specialized rifle, i.e DMRs, Sniper rifles, or shotguns. Get an assault rifle, and a couple of magazines.,If you've never been to an event before, maybe rent one before you start spending money on it. I don't know about the US, but over here in the UK if you ask people will generally let you take a few shots with their rifle, and tell you their thoughts.,What about all the tac gear? A good sidearm?,that comes later. worry about not getting your eyes shot out and being able to shoot your opponents first.,You don't need it. With cheap AEGs you'll get a hicap mag, so you won't need a belt/vest/carrier for extra mags -- you're going to use just one. Same with sidearms -- you just simply won't need it with a hicap mag.,A sling might be useful, if there isn't one included with the gun. Makes moving around a whole lot easier. Also, make sure you've got something to carry the AEG around in. A backpack or a bag that will fit it nicely. Show up in public with a replica in plain view and I'll hunt you down and skin your ass.,Classic evike.,Welshy is my hero.

"Any of you guys ever been to an event or even competed in one.,pic related, it's my robot, specs:,Weight:13.4kg,Top speed: 20mph,Weapon: Electric lifter,Lifting capacity:100kg(220lbs),armour: 3mm steel,oh man I love robocombat. Shame the show hosted by Y2J is just virtual MMA. ,There's this one flash game where you get to build robots and have them fight. Its called robot rage. However they rehashed it like within the last year and it's not as good.,I used to play robot rage then I started playing robot arena 2 as it actually gives you the freedom to make whatever you want, there's even a forum dedicated to it even though it was released 10 years ago.,ill look that up when I get to my computer.,Yeah, they redid robot rage.

His Aikido was pretty good back in the day,and hes a fucking psycho, but whatever, most TMA guys are,That's because they believe that they can kill you with their Ki or whatever the fuck. We may have differences over Boxing and MMA, but at least we both agree that as sports they involve hurting each other, wheras TMAs are about flailing 'Traditionally' and 'With Proper Form',I agree and disagree. I've taken Japanese jujutsu for just as long as boxing, and while they DO talk a lot about ki, its not like the stupid americanized shit you see people talking about.,To best explain it, I would say that ki should equal ""intention"" in american terms, kind of. The strict beginning and end of techniques, the power you show over your opponent, the ""energy"" you put out, it should all be this killer intent. No fucking around and laughing, no stopping mid technique to try over again, no throwing the guy to the ground and walking away. ,You toss the guy on the ground and you stare him dead in his eyes for a couple seconds, THEN you help him up and laugh at how bad he got thrown.,And to be honest, I actually really enjoy learning about Japanese history, shinto/buddist philosophy etc. The shitty part is, most westernized martial arts take this way above and beyond where it should be, to the point where they say MA aren't actually about fighting, but about love and peace, as if they believe they are a hermit living on Mt. Fuji with their ninja clan.,Did you ever watch Lawman? Seagal thinks aikido has given him super powers.,I wouldn't doubt it. He thinks lots of silly things.,Dat fucking grace,and sometimes even says them.,Having studied Judo, i'm familiar with the concept of aiki. I love the austere nature of Japanese philosophy, but i've never understood why each and every martial art from the east comes pre-packaged with its' own particular brand of bullshit mysticism. I'm not talking about the folk tales about the founding of the art, but y'know, this part,Why the fuck did this happen? Do the serious people simply not immigrate? I know that things like Aikido, Taichi and Karate have the potential to be effective, but i've never witnessed it.,The idea of having a serious focus on ki in martial arts seems bizarre to me. My club have always focused on mechanics behind a movement and practical application.,Then, a lot of the higher grades and dans have been known to argue ""Our style is very traditional, jiujitsu is traditionally about beating the shit out of people who attack you."",I think it comes from 2 things:,1) Samurai during the Meiji era ruined everything. They were bored with peace and basically worthless since their skills had no value, so they started saying ""oh, our skills aren't just about killing Taka-kun. We can paint, and make tea and write poems and be faggots while at the same acting superior to everyone else."" This just kept going and we learned this behavior.,2) Asian martial arts are exotic. Ninja boom in the 60s. Kung fu in the 70s. Karate in the 80s. Ninja again in the 90s. Everyone wants to see this strange way of punching, this strange way of kicking, this strange way of living and this strange way of thinking. The reason a lot of MA come prepackaged with asian philosophy simply because the instructors come from there and think differently. A good example:,vs,Too very different ways of going about life, and this opened peoples minds to different possibilities.,Also, Bruce Lee.,Didnt mean to quote you above, but I'll address you now.,I don't think I have a serious focus on ki in my jujutsu school, its mostly practical training. However the first thing we are taught is that every technique we learn has a beginning, a middle and an end. ,The beginning is you facing your opponent ,you show your intent, you force your will onto him. To put this in westernized terms, this is the prefight ritual in boxing and MMA. You stare him down, you show him with your mind that you're about to destroy this mother fucker.,The middle is the actual technique.,The end is you giving him the death stare again, the stare that says ""if you fucking get up from the mat, the same thing is going to happen to you again"". This is good practice for real life situations. After you throw a guy, or put him in a lock or whatever. You make sure his ass knows he better stay down.,Eventually, this just becomes second nature and there is no ""focus"" on it. You just do it. Like I said, theres no playing around or laughing or half assing anything. You fight how you train and if these things are instilled in you early on, and you can switch it on and off at will, real life self defense situations are going to go your way much more often.,Eh, Seagal has gotten a bit... strange as he got older.,That was the prime thought of the founder of Aikido, and he didn't invent that himself, nor was he alone in feeling that way. You can't dismiss it that easily. It's actually very easy to try and see why he ans others said that, it just requires thinking in a different direction than you did. Try it again.,Now that being said, there are also a lot of people in modern times who say that, but they mean the wrong thing while saying that. If you can find the answer to that contradiction, you'll also instantly see why.,As for the explanation of ki, I can agree. Intention and the physical and mental energy you put out into your technique or attack. The term has gotten quite a bit diluted and taken out of context, but AFAIK no one in ever claimed in the subject of serious discussion that ki enabled people to shoot laser beams.,later on in your training, sure, MA can be about finding yourself, behaving properly etc IF THATS WHAT YOU WANT TO TAKE FROM IT. However this moral shit wasn't written in any scrolls that I know of, its just passed on from instructors to students if they are willing to learn. It by no means is what MAs are ABOUT,You're still not thinking about the bigger picture. To elaborate, don't take it literally, word-meaning by word-meaning. That's what the second group I mentioned did, and there was their error. ,It's not even about morals. It's also something very fundamental so writing it would miss the aim.,I'm not being condescending, you're getting me wrong. I believe in all honesty that this is something very fundamental and easy to see and the only reason people don't is because they don't look towards the correct direction, and it's not even because they lack something, it's because the 2 directions look very much the same. ,Calm down. If I wanted to be condescending I'd have written ""hurrr retard mma guys like you cant even stay 2 seconds without fite hurrr retards hurrr 2deep4u ur not intelligent enough durrr wrekt gb2 to ur sports lel"".,I'll ask you a question instead then, what is real pacifism?,You're being condescending by saying you know something very simple and fundamental to MAs, and yet you wont say what this something is. Then you talk in riddles like a Zen master and ask me questions to guide me towards the light.,Like that.,I get that you're trying to be nice, but you aren't coming off that way. Im probably older than you with much more experience so how about talking to me like an adult instead of a young grasshopper.,I hate Broner.,Dumbass little cunt trying to model himself off of Mayweather.,He just posted a vid the other day of him throwing $20s from a wad of a cash, down the toilet.,But it's good for selling views, when everyone hates you for being an obnoxious tool.,I just wanted you to think, because like I said 3 times now it's very simple. I'm sorry for trying to maintain a conversation-like tone. You should never bring the question of age in a discussion on the net, both because you can be surprised, and because it's basically the same as saying ""I'll kill you irl in 1v1 fite"". Besides like I said i my first post, you're dismissing the honest feeling of men much wiser and experienced than anyone here, which really shows that you simply got mad for no reason at what I wrote and didn't even take 2 seconds to think.,Now that it's out of the way, I'll spell it out for you.,Fighting, in a way that can occur to you in your everyday life, is an unpredictable and vitally important affair. You might be a top ranked fighter of the UFC, but the moment you get stabbed, it's over. You may be respected and revered by your students at the dojo, but the moment you get shot, it's over. There are myriad ways one can inflict harm upon another, involving both bare hands and weapons, and there are myriad enemies you can encounter, who can be small or large enough to grip your head in one of their hands, who can be utterly inexperienced and scared of blood or who have already killed people and have had more action in their lives than you ever will. ,As such, since combat is so unpredictable, learning how to fight is just a single step in actual self defense. Before coming to blows, a lot of things happen and a lot of things pave the path to a fight, from the way you walk, to the places you go. Most people (this is from direct personal experience) don't have a trouble-repellent attitude but instead are like potential magnets instead, doesn't matter whether they've been into fights or not or whether they're actively thinking about fighting or not. ,(continued),Is his name really just a portmanteau of Bro and Boner, or is that a stage name?,Really? Man he seems so talented shame he's a piece of shit.,Pretty pumped for Rios vs Alvarado 2 this weekend anyone else?,no sure if serious but i had a good laugh at that.,but yeah he's real name is broner,You sound like such a faggot.,DYEL?,Yeah, he's a piece of shit.,continued:,Conversely, because of luck, most people like above won't ever get into any serious confrontation. For obvious reasons an experienced martial artist such as yourself can think about, people should precisely be avoiding confrontations on the street. But what happens if you run out of luck and you do get into one? You could lose your life in an instant, because of that low probability event happening. this is no different than a car accident. So in order to survive a dangerous encounter like that, it's important to learn how to fight.,Now like I said in the first part, this survival phase (the fight) is the thing that happens at the end of a long string of events. Your thinking says that the aim of an art that teaches you to save your life should only teach you about how to do it when worse comes to worst. Does that even make sense in the slightest? No. It's like a chief of staff maintaining that for army personnel it's only important to learn how to shoot the other guys with guns.,The bigger picture here is to learn how to live so that you won't ever need to fight, and not simply to learn to survive. Traditional martial arts all have this feeling at their core (you can verify this both by reading their founders' or prevalent teachers' thoughts, and also by reading about what warriors in the past who actually fought and killed wrote), and it all stemmed from this very simple line of thinking every human being can realize. There's also another layer. Within the structure of properly enforced TMA, you learn many things that force you into growing as a person. In the end you become a physically and mentally strong person, people trust you and like you. You don't want to get into aggressive confrontations with others, be it physical or verbal. Thus you gain pacifism, but it's real pacifism: you never fight until all your options to not fight are depleted, but when you fight you are very capable in doing so. ,Next will be the final post:,#shoutout2myoldhoes,#swag,#hatersgonnahate,Do you have any idea of how many fighters have had successful pro careers, coming from street fighting backgrounds?,If you're a true fighter, then you are both in and outside of the ring.,Your way of life will hopefully influence others and motivate them into achieving this state, and so they improve themselves a bit just by being around you. This is why people like the founder of Aikido stated: martial arts are a way of peace. With the practice of learning how to fight, survive and live, you accomplish peace in your life, and how to fight becomes in the end the least of your worries.,Now 2 things must be said after all this.,First, some people take ""martial arts are not for fighting"" literally, and without giving consideration to all this, they just claim that ""this MARTIAL (ie pertaining to war and combat) ART must not be useful to fight others but to do other stuff"". From the beginning this is a flawed stance. It's martial arts, not life arts or moral arts.,Second, people have overall different expectations from martial arts. Some like the way the body is worked out and like the cultural heritage in TMA, others see moral development as important as physical and technical development, and others want to use martial arts as a way of contest with others in a fair, controlled and measurable environment. You fall into the final group, and there's nothing wrong with that. You like the act of strategic fighting, you like to work out, etc. Any and all are valid reasons. However, as valid as they are, this way of viewing is still only the end of the line, it's only the act of coming to blows. As such, just because a certain martial art is never used in the fighting contest of your choice, it doesn't mean that it's ineffective or bullshit, and getting worked up on the saying ""martial arts are for peace"" simply stems from not giving universal thought to the issue, ie missing the tree while concentrating on the leaf. ,That's all. I hope you read these calmly and without thinking that I'm patronizing you, because I'm not.,Ah yes, Kimbo Slice. ""Street fighting background"", if you believe their word for it. That aside when I talked about the street, I didn't mean punching and kicking in the street because of retarded arguments, that's something even kids do at some point in their life. I meant about what you do when 5 guys with iron pipes and knives gang up on you, or some asshole fed up with life goes on a killing spree with a machete and you by chance happen to be added to his list at that moment, among many other examples. Sorry but I seriously doubt Kimbo regularly met with such situations and was into serious deep shit 24/7, him being in professional fighting is proof that he's way more intelligent than that.,2tuff4me. I don't think there's anything missing in my arguments about pacifism, so right now you're simply blindly disagreeing with me with no arguments, and by disregarding my entire 2 posts. Cool bro. In this case let's just agree to disagree.,I wont deny that theres a lot of pacifism in TMA, and that a lot of them will ""deplete all other options before fighting"". However, this is a huge scapegoat for DYEL faggot weaboos on why they dont spar, or train with intent, or fight in a ring. Martial arts are about fighting, first and foremost. The philosophical shit is only applicable after you have proven yourself to be the best. This is why famous martial artists write books about this stuff: Hagakure, The Book of Five Rings, Tao of Jeet Kun Do, Art of War etc. These were all written by men that have already killed/beaten dozens of people and have finally had time to sit down and reflect on their lives.,This line of thinking is like running before you can crawl if you're a 17 year old white kid from the suburbs.,3 posts like this is necessary for a proper argumentation, come on.,Lots of explanations for those, most accusations aren't even true, and honestly who cares about what some guys on the net say? I always maintained that if someone doubts the veracity of something very heavily, he should go ahead and challenge it himself. All those people just talk, never act, and so frankly are not worthy of consideration.,Tsunetomo never fought and killed a single person in his entire life, he just executed some guys. It is not even sure if Sun Tzu was a single person or not, and it's also unknown what exactly did the people who wrote in his stead accomplished, if the theory holds true. Of course the texts are still very relevant, but what you said right now isn't that relevant anymore. Why do you think these people bothered to write about these things? Why do you think Musashi of all people did a complete 180 on his thoughts of youth? They didn't write these just so that people could read and say ""oh cool, this guy thinks like this"". They wrote it so that people could merge these thoughts they reached after much struggle without going through all that. It still doesn't mean that they will be fully understood, but it's still a help, I personally appreciate the BoFR and Hagakure a lot, and also Taira Shigesuke's book.,Not at all, for reasons I explained in the posts. It's more like knowing that one day you will run and jump when learning to crawl, but analogies are unreliable so better not continue.,And I never denied that, I never said proper training could be put aside in favor of spiritual practice or theory.,I've met these people.. they aren't stereotypes, they exist by the thousands.,But thats the way of the world. You can't begin acting like an old guy when you're young, you have to earn it. You have to learn all this stuff on your own, thats the great paradox of life. When you're finally old enough to understand everything, you're too old for it to matter. Youth is wasted on the young, as they say. Im not saying that you should ignore people much wiser than you, Im just saying that people take Musashi's writings and try to apply it to themselves instead of realizing that for him to get to that level of thinking required numerous people to die and hours upon hours of training. They use this as an excuse to not learn how to properly fight because they train in the ""way of fighting without fighting"". ,Then what are we arguing about?,we need another exciting ass fighter like the PRINCE hahah miss that guy. that's why pac caught on, he's vicious and exciting. ali and his counterparts were insane. that's when you see boxing as a whole become more popular, when there is excitement. mayweather, good as hell, but not exciting to me,Prince.... really? I mean, I guess he was kind of entertaining but that guy was a joke.,36 fights and 31 KO's i think he is a bit more than kind of entertaining.,coming in on a flying carpet?? fuckin genius hahaha i miss that excitement. so what he didn't come back. the time he was fighting he made boxing fun,That I know, though I don't really know such a person personally. But we as humans are prone to misunderstand a lot of things,I agree, but things like those writings can help you make less errors on the way. After all you can invent martial arts by yourself too, but it's easier to learn from someone and get to a higher level by practice.,Ah, those people, they are wrong, they're the same kind of people who think that it's OK to do things your own way when starting a martial art because Bruce Lee said that it's important to retain what works and what doesn't, and they do it without even reaching the level they can judge that.,We're not arguing, I just pointed out the reason why traditional arts rightfully talk about the importance of not fighting and that just because they also teach about how to beat people up doesn't mean that they can be simplified just to that. Some arts talk about peace and gloss out on practice, others talk about it and back it up with practice.,and zero real opponents other than Barrara who made him look silly,He could have been great if he wasn't such a fuck up in his training.,I think I hate this most of all.,true, and sadly that's that. i wish there was more. but i remember entrances like coming in in a cadillac instead of the ones just joggin in haha,I know right. It's even worse when Lee didn't really cloud out on his words and explained what he meant clearly enough... provided they kept looking at it after hearing that Bruce Lee ""discarded"" his kung fu, because apparently that makes of pictures shortcuts flash before the eyes of some. Occasionally people are so full of this and say things so bizarre that at those times I wish Lee never existed. I've never met one in real life though and so it just stays as a superficial wish, thank God.,hey im not saying hes the GOAT just sayin he's entertaining,There's no way for him to have forseen his teachings being twisted until he became kung-fu jesus, and I dont think he'd approve of what others have done with them. Its the case with most great thinkers of any sort.,How does Xingiyi get past guards well? From hat i've been able to gather of it, it seems extremely similar to boxing, even how they generate power for strikes.,Sorry I'm not sure about that, I'm not the one who talked about Xingiyi.,I know its probably because of the shitty quality but damn, i didn't even see him connect. that it was so fuckin quick.,Why do Americans always call the Klitchkos boring despite their high KO percentages but cream their pants over Floyd Fucking Mayweather?,What's their problem?,That sounds incredibly pigheaded and chauvinistic. I hope youre seriously not consider fighting is this only way to express yourself as being masculine,Seriously one of the best punchers of all time. His back was so wide and he was so tall for his weight class, its ridiculous. ,Heres a slightly better quality vid and gif,http://www.youtube.com/watch?featur,.... way to project, brah. He didn't say that at all. He's just saying fighting has taught him a lot about himself, and thats a pretty common theme in traditional martial arts as well as MMA and boxing.,Because they are almost guaranteed to win, they have no competition. Mayweather is always susceptible to that one strong KO punch.,Its not actually projecting you mongoloid or else he wouldnt add the completely unnecessary phrase ""as a man"" and ""how to be a man"". That obviously signifies some intent to imply that it educated him in some preconceived notion of gender role,oh god that cauliflower ear...it reminds me of dumbo,Yeah, and it does. Whats your point?,What exactly is your retarded liberal mind trying to say?,Theres no politics in this its obviously a gender biased statement regardless of the merits of MA. Associating those qualities with a gender is nothing short of fucking retarded,I can tell exactly what kind of obnoxious person you are. Please lose the trip before you turn into some infamous faggot fuck on /asp/ that only looks like they care about attention,woops too late,wtf are you even talking about dude? You came into a thread about fighting and started talking about gender roles like a huge faggot. The only one looking for attention is you.,Even at martial arts' most basal of attributes, fighting, is a masculine role: protecting yourself and your family from physical threats. If you're too fucking stupid to see that then I dont know what else to say to you.,Get the fuck out of this thread.,I've seen sweet science post before in boxing threads on /fit/ and such.,He is an authority and is a positive contributor.,Even keep his cool when responding to dumbfucks, like yourself.,Definitely a tripfriend i'm always down to see post.,Hopkins is getting up there, and still going strong.,Oldest fighter to win a belt.,I still think he has a few more fights in him, especially considering his competition.,In case you havent seen it, here he is giving Rashad Evans some punching advice:,http://youtu.be/SHwPBTDDp00,So many years of boxing knowledge dropped in 5 minutes, he's a smart fighter.,Damn, thanks for sharing.,Great vid.,Feel free to share any others.,5/5 bretty gud czech them,Man that's awesome, it really pisses me off that people think they have to pick one sport and hate the other there's so much to be learned in all combat sports.,A lot of the older documentaries/videos I have aren't up on youtube anymore, but here is a snippet of Bhop talking about his jab and some dirty tricks,http://youtu.be/JZ5IBrHaswg,Actually, this whole series In This Corner is great. A lot of clips are on youtube under the name SecondsOut,Donaire talking the mechanics of his knockout of Darchinyan towards the end of the video, fucking awesome,http://youtu.be/OzTmBwPEVS0,Funny im going to Jean Pascal vs Lucian Bute. Anywhere i can find a discography? They show some replays on TV here but i wanna watch in order.,Meh. Wasn't impressed by this. Marquez was getting a firm beatdown and then stepped on Pacs foot while he was coming in, Pac tripped right into the punch.,.,Nevada ,Las Vegas,Southwest has a lot of gyms , east vegas has some but you won't find them on yelp or anything , North Vegas shockingly has about 2 or 3 from the top of my head that I can name whereas west has more mma gyms.,dude are you kidding? i've watched a majority of their fights and i love it. they're both so much fun to watch,idk what it was, but damn. watching that hurt my face. if there is pac vs jmm V....i'm gonna be so pumped. pac just needs to watch his jab-jab-straight...,man that KO is awesome so many subtleties,It was def a good punch, he was landing it all night but it wasn't really hurting pac much. Pac fell right into it because yeah, he got his foot stepped on. Marquez def did it on purpose, as Pac always complained about his ankles hurting after fighting him. Gotta do what you gotta do, I guess. Nice KO.,i know it's possible but it's going to be a pita fighting against 17 y/o,What have you got to lose?,50 bucks or so on an amateur license?,well that and he could get permanently injured,How so?,It's unlikely to get permanently injured in boxing, especially in sparring and in the ams.,do amateurs wear headgear and shirts?,In the ring? Probably not on the headgear. In practice, generally you can do what you like. Of course a lot of this stuff varies by your location,weird i thought amateurs were required to wear headgear and top. (in the uk),They are staring to change that, and will start scoring am rounds like pro rounds.,if they make you go topless i'm quitting. (gyno),Does anybody else wish we'd have fighters of the caliber like the Fab 4 in the 80's: Duran, Leonard, Hagler, and Hearns? No bullshit, just straight-up the best fighters against one another. That's why those guys are legends because they didn't duck one another. ,Leonard vs Hearns I is still one of the greatest see-sawing wars I've ever seen. ,Though I really like how Showtime promoted the Super 6 in the super-middleweight class.,This is probably one of best scalps for Hearns. Too bad Duran was starting to lose his edge at this time.,Well Canelo vs Trout is next month.,Two undefeated superwelterweights going at eachother. I'm stoked to see it.,Sadly, I really hate seeing this. Many titleholders dodging fighters, because they know they might genuinely risk their belt.,Like Money May.,I love how deep the talent pool is for 166 pounds. It was one of the most overlooked divisions in past years. ,And yeah, it's BS that all these ABC belt holders are around and not fighting one another. I miss the days when there were only 2 championship belts. Though the WBA's current system with Super Champ, Interim Champ, Lineal Champ, etc. is pissing me off.,Well pro boxing is a business. I get that. But I hate seeing boxers trying to be businessmen moreso than real fighters. ,Yeah, the ranking with the WBA is kinda silly. But hell, that's being used in the trout vs alvarez fight.,I'm alright the varying boxing sanctions making world champions, really making what it means to be a lineal or undisputed champ.,However, I've read an article recently referring to current most currently feared boxers, and they referred to this undefeated fighter , as a 'stepping stone' for other middleweights, like Martinez.,That bluntly pissed me off. Triple G is willing to fight anyone, and just hasn't been given the opportunity to fight Martinez. I don't see how that article writer could reference him as a middleweight 'stepping stone'.. when he's undefeated.,Just ranting.,I hear ya anon. Let's just hope that promoters realize that you need to have the champs and leading contenders against one another. It's good for business and for the fans. ,Nice to see another fan of Smokin' Joe. That man never got the respect he deserved and it pisses the fuck out of me that all these people praised him to high heaven when he died. Where the fuck were they when Frazier had health problems?,Or how about the fact that there isn't a statue of him in Philly while there's a statue of a fictional boxer?,Well if it makes you feel any better, both Stallone and Frazier are in the Hall of Fame.,...even though many of the things Rocky did in the movies, are based off of what Frazier did in real life.,I think there should be a statue of him there, not Stallone.,Hell, Stallone went on to make most all of the Rocky movies purely for profit, moreso than the integrity of cinema and boxing. With most of the films basically being the same damn plot, recycled.,Only lost to two fighters twice in his entire career.,I remember watching a documentary with him, and how during the Thrilla in Manilla, Ali's corner about to throw in the towel as well.,If only his corner would've waited a few minutes or seconds, he would've won the 2/3 bouts with Ali.,Really sucks how many don't give a shit until someone's dead. And many of the greats will be drying within the next decade or two.,Yep. And Frazier is the ONLY man to face Foreman twice in pro boxing. Not even Ali did that. ,When I first saw the Thrilla in Manila, I honestly thought somebody was going to go out in a stretcher. They were out for blood. Frazier especially. Dude, took all those shots but he just kept on coming.,And I've seen Ali vs Frazier 2. Ali was holding onto Frazier WAY too often. ,And it sickens me that Stallone leeched off of Frazier's life for his movie franchise. Joe deserved more that. He needs a biopic movie of his own.,OBLIGATORY CHARLEY BURLEY VIDEO,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81no,It will never happen. Especially now with the split between Golden Boy and HBO. I honestly think it will get worse before it gets better. If Broner leaves HBO, that leaves them without Canelo, Hopkins, Mayweather, Gomez, Ponce De Leon, Haye, James Kirkland, Wilder, Malinaggi, Garry Russel Jr, Matthyse...,It's going to be ugly.,I'm sorry, I fucked that one up. I meant to say, if Broner leaves HBO, they'll have no one else to build up. It leaves them without...***,I really hop Trout runs through Canelo. I think he is over-hyped, and one dimensional. He's a tough guy--no doubt about it--but he is no where near the caliber of fighter that Cotto is...,Not to do boxing math, but if Trout fights Canelo like he fought Cotto, Canelo is going to have a rough night.,You think that's bad? Take a look at this list of sanctioning bodies.,http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/C,Speaking of which, does anybody else think that they're needs to be a super-heavyweight class?,I watch a lot of old-school fights and fuck do I love them. Especially the heavyweights when they were no more than 200 pounds or a little over. These guys were strong fit and skilled. Take a look at Jerry Quarry vs Joe Frazier I. Nobody fights like that anymore. ,I think heavyweight should be 210 pounds. Get rid of cruiserweight. Anything over 210 pounds is super-heavyweight. Or shit, have any openweight division for guys that are over 250 pounds.,Canelo has more pro fights under his belt than Trout, and is also younger.,I sure as hell hope Trout wins though. We needs more 'muricans claiming belts.,Yeah, but that doesn't mean anything. Canelo has been fed a slew of cherry-picked fighters (worse than Mayweather has in recent years) from the very beginning. It's very common for this in combat sports; you build guys up with a perfect record fighting guys who (mostly) have losing records. ,Not to say that he's not a good fighter, but I would be surprised if he gets past Trout. He was talking about his next fight, which is supposedly scheduled two-three months after the Trout fight, kind of giving the impression that he was already looking over Trout...,If I were Trout, I'd be mad as hell.,Well the UFC has varying weight classes like that.,Well what about that gap between light heavyweight and beginning of heavyweight?,That's 25 pounds a fighter can fit into as a cruiserweight.,Besides, many cruiserweights don't stick around that class for too long, before moving up.,What, and make a 'super heavyweight' class beyond that?,That's kinda stupid. MANY, if not most heavyweights were over 210.,Hell, even short (for a heavyweight) Mike Tyson was 220 at 5'10.,Klitschko is like 230-240 or so at 6'6.,7 feet tall, and over 300 pounds.,It would be stupid to get rid of a weight class that has been around for decades, and to add in a weight class.,One of the best things about heavyweights, is how much it can vary between fighters. Sluggers like Foreman and Butterbean, and stout fast guys like Tyon.,As someone who fights left handed, you have no idea how often this happens, even in low intensity sparring.,Meant to reply to,kinda funny how the mess-up worked out, though,I can tolerate a 15 or 20 pound difference amongst heavyweights. But it makes no sense for a 220 pound guy against a 260 pounder.,A 25 lb difference in a boxing match is a little absurd, even in the heavyweights.,I know, but back in the pre-80's era of heavyweights. you rarely had guys over 220 unless you were behemoths like Jess Willard or Primo Carnera. I prefer the strong fit guys like Jack Johnson, Jack Dempsey, Gene Tunney, Joe Louis, Ezzard Charles, Jersey Joe Walcott, Rocky Marciano, Floyd Patterson, Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, etc.,That's what makes the heavyweight class what it is- unlimited.,What, make the heavyweight class only between 200-240?,But is that still a '40 pound absurd difference'?,Superweight beyond that? Only have giants and fatasses mainly in that weight class who mainly just slug it out?,25 pounds can only affect a fighter so much if they let it.,Clinches happen so often for heavyweight, and that's mainly the biggest problem for weight difference- leaning on the lighter/smaller fighter during a clinch wears 'em down.,During the Martinez vs Chavez jr fight, Chavez came in at 180. That's abot 15-20 lbs he had on Martinez as a MIDDLEWEIGHT, not even a heavyweight.,Martinez still won.,This is not true. 25 pounds is a huge difference, even for a sparring match.,Chavez went in completely exhausted and filled up with water. ,I don't know what fight you watched, but despite the fact that Sergio schooled Chavez in rounds 1-10, the weight difference was DEFINITELY taking its toll on him. If Chavez had walked into that fight having trained to fight at 180, it would have had a huge impact on the fight.,taking its toll on Martinez*,Also, Chavez does this in every fight. It's no secret that it gives him an advantage, even if he comes in malnourished and filled with water.,Most fighters try to drop 10-15 lbs to make weight, because they know that if they fight at their ""walking"" weight, they'll fight someone who is most likely 10-15 lbs naturally bigger than they are.,Still, I feel like if they were black, Americans wouldn't deride them for being, they would salivate over their ""total domination"". I think American sports fans have become somewhat of athletic cuckholds.,My sides,I never understood the hype over Tyson. Yes he had plenty of promise as a young fighter. But he lacked the mental faculties to develop as a true champion. ,I remember one guy saying that Tyson would beat Frazier. The difference between the 2 is that if Frazier get's knocked down, he'll pick himself right back up and fight on. Tyson will lose heart and get frustrated, eventually succumbing to Frazier's superior work rate and devastating hooks. ,Ali in his prime was great. He had a lightning-fast jab, a great uppercut, and can absorb tremendous physical punishment. But he lacked boxing fundamentals. He'd lean away from punches because when he had his speed, he could get away with it. But he never properly learned to defend. He paid for this when he had his 3 matches against Ken Norton. ,If there was one heavyweight that I'd bet good money to beat Ali, it'd be Joe Louis. Joe had all the right tools to defeat Ali. A prime Jersey Joe Walcott with his bag of tricks could possibly do it too if he's smart and savvy.,is boxing dying?,that's it. he didn't just use that speed defensively, he'd make you leave yourself open, by just outquicking you, then using those points to do damage. a prime joe louis couldn't beat a prime ali. for some reason though, I could see Walcott giving him trouble,I am gonna start going to this board, solely for boxing gifs.,They're pretty cool,This is solid advice, thanks for sharing !,Any kickboxing love in here?,https://twitter.com/KimiCouture/sta,Ali only fought Norton twice,Ali would slap Tyson silly. He had the best chin of all time so some flash 2 round knockout woulnd't happen,My bad he did fight him three times,The GIF should show how Hunt is just standing up again and continues the fight.,Like Frazier, Norton gave Ali a tough fight and the fact the first match they had, Norton won.,It's cheaper than that, actually. I believe it's no more than $35.,Golovkin just won his fight earlier today vs Ishida.,KO by the 3rd round.,I hope he gets around to fighting Martinez soon. ,He needs a real opponent.,Bumping this thread back to the front.,Anyone familiar with Devon Alexander? He's got good hands and I'm hoping he'd be the one to beat Mayweather.,Guerrero is going to be the one who's going beat mayweather.,I think theres a few people that could beat Mayweather, he wouldn't ever fight them, though.,Shit, I bet Clottey would have beat Mayweather, but he knows what a bigger guy with good defense and hard punches would do to him.,Just watch Lion Fight 9, so many possible GIFs, mainly from the Topic fight,Nice wide gap between shoulder and chin.,I noticed too.... almost looks like a Karate punch,i like the people derping about the UFC #'s going down when they've actually been going up again. 158 ended up in the top10 all-time in PPV buys and the fox/fx/fuel ratings have all been rising.,dor starters, the level of comp in HW boxing is incredibly fucking sad. So we're watching a decent boxer against people who were generally too unathletic to get into major stick and ball sports. ,Secondly, they aren't really KO'ing too many people much anymore, but are rather pot-shotting them to death for late-round bivtories that are more accumulation damage rather than violent one-punch knockouts. What they're doing is nice and all, but not all that enjoyable to watch.,I say the same on mayweather tho. However more people appreciate him because he's undefeated in a much harder weight-class. People like a winner, regardless.,man i should pay attention when i type,I think 158 was purposely over hyped, ended in disappointment,Was like watching UFC when there were 15 minutes rounds and no

"Come at me board-fags,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B86P,I roll, but I skateboard and bike a little too. I just thought everything looked fun, and it was!,I need to get some new wheels and do some skating this summer, missed out last season and only barely skated the year before.,What's hot gear wise lately? I'm way out of touch, I've had my Xsjado Latimers since like 2008 or something.,If you haven't experienced the USD carbon series (carbon 2 pictured) I would highly recommend you do. The Xsjado 2.0 just came out but it has some structural problems in the first batch.,jet set radio future got me into inline skating does anybody else try to make videos of there skate runs,I use XSJado's can't remember what model, but they are the same as the ones CJ uses in this video.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgoF,its probably just a case of you sucking,I suck because I still can't get the speed to get back up fully the other side of the 12 half pipe for some reason. ,I can actually skate easily, the quality of the paths around here are terrible and the skate parks are designed for riders, I rarely see skateboarders at them as well.,When I say the paths are terrible, I literally mean the cement slabs are cracked and warped to the point by roots and water etc etc that you have concrete overlapping eachother, also the fact everyone has fucking gravel for the front of their house, means the paths are also covered in gravel and pebbles. ,I've fucked many a set of wheels trying to skate down to the local mall which is only a few kilometers away.,I bladed for 14 years. sadly I quit about 2 yrs ago due to professional/family life intruding as well as the overwhelming amount of faggotry displayed by these ""swaggy"" younger kids...i miss the days of coup d'tat...,where do u live? the fucking rain forest?,I respect rollerblading as a way to get gnarly and experience life, but honestly most of the 'rad' shit you do down stairs/rails looks absolutely retarded. You look like fucking elderly balerinas.,Even bmxicans are gnarlier than you.,the technical difficulty and subtle intricities in different combos of tricks in rollerblading is actually second to none..its hard to understand unless you've spend countless hours learning different variations weather it be true-spin, illusion, switch, etc...way more possibilities than most ""action sports"". again, its hard to understand for the untrained spectator, its true that it can all look the same.,seriously, where do you live that doesnt have pavement?,uuum B-More. i think you misunderstood what i was saying.,I always thought skating way gay as fuck, OP your video did not change opinion of it.,that ollie is fucking nuts. only just seen his welcome to enjoi part, it's amazing!,gotta disagree about inline, it's pretty gnar. the size of the gaps they hit is unreal. the average fruit booter down the park looks pretty dumb (like the average 13 yo skateboarder doing ""nightmare flips"" or some shit), but i've met some good ones.,question for fruit booters: do you guys discuss/care about inline skater's style? can you steez out those sick grindz?,might be hard to do, but still looks gay as fuck.,i was under the impression that after the late 80s early 90s the only people who still rollerblade are homosexuals,be mag reporting in,wax on coping?!?!?!? wtf bruh, like metal on metal and plastic on metal is comparable...<end sarcasm>,lrn2physics,Australia.,they also wax the bottoms of stairs so they can revert and shit,like,fuck,Skateboarders have this misconception that rollerbladers think of our tricks in equal terms. No skater jumps 3 feet into the air and thinks to themselves ""That was just as difficult as doing an ollie 3 feet in the air."" Olliing (sp) is clearly more difficult. The difference that skateboarders always fail to see is that blading is about the control of the whole body. We don't 'ride skates' the way you ride a board. The skates are a tool and a means to achieving something. I'll throw some examples out.,It takes months to learn to kick-flip. Let's say we are talking about a flat ground kick-flip at cruising speed. Any rollerblading trick that can be done on flat ground at cruising speed is not hard, and we don't compare it to a kick flip. It's just considered silly stuff you can do while rolling. An equivalent trick in terms of time and practice would be, let's say a 360 into a sole grind. Where a skateboarder jumps and controls the board, a skater jumps and spins his body and then has to land the correct grinds: Arguably more compromising than doing a kick-flip, and it takes just as long to learn. (again, as I mentioned in my previous post, the likely hood of getting fucked up is still greater on skates, even though they are roughly comparable in terms of practice due to factors like slipping out, sticking and not being able to land),Where rollerblading fails to impress onlookers in this situation is spectacle. A skateboarder has a large piece of wood spinning in the air which directs attention to the ""trick"" aspect of the trick. When you 360 into a sole grind there is nothing to show that anything spectacular is occurring, nothing to draw attention to the fact that almost the exact same motor skills are being used in the legs as would be used to kick flip.,There is really nothing unusual about a human body spinning 360 degrees so the difficulty of the trick seems non existent. Furthermore, the skills involved in doing a 360-grind are entirely different depending on which grind you are landing on, but to the onlooker it all looks like the same thing - a spin into an indistinguishable foot slide.,Because of this, a dude doing a bunch of different 360 grinds on a ledge at a skate park is equivalently running through a nollie, a kick-flip, shove it etc. and because it looks comparatively unimpressive, there is more impetus to go faster, bigger, and spin more. What this means is skating tricks increase in danger at an exponential rate.,Let's draw a parallel between skateboarding and snow boarding. No snow boarder thinks that doing a grind on a picnic table is that big of a deal. It's a much bigger deal on a skate board, rightfully so...and because that doesn't amount to skill the snowboarder does a misty flip off of a huge kicker.,Hey guys. Playing with legos doesn't look as cool as skateboard. Lego fucking faggots.,at the end of the day rollerblading is a fad and is too easy, it has no culture or scene. BMX (in the uk anyways) is mostly scallys/chavs and there is like 3 fucking tricks you can do, fucking.lame. Skateboarding is the only thing you should do as its not a sport, fucking nothing to do with a sport its a way of life. so sick and tired of idiot fruitbooters and bmx, because of these idiots we have lame fucking skateparks. ugh too many years spent hating on these losers, grow some fucking balls and buy a skateboard, the only reason you dont skate is becuase its fucking hard and takes YEARS to get even half way good.,bmx - kill yourself,rollerblader - kill yourself,scooter - omg, i cant even. . .,This is a joke right? With so many of the grinds being as fundamentally simple as they are, steez is the only thing separating babies first torque from someone sitting on their boot with their back leg boned out over the ledge. Style is all about getting super low in your grinds and riding in and out smooth.,tfw I wax up a rail for a session and skaters give me all sorts of shit about it despite the fact that all they do it tap the very end of it while I'm consistently hitting its full length.,tfw I ask to see one of their boards for a second and boardslide half of the ""unskateably waxed"" rail on my first try despite not skateboarding.,take a trip to the bitter cold show down, the hoe down, winter clash, or any other large gathering of rollerbladers and tell me there is no culture. on a side note, how does it feel to know that your ""sub-culture"" has turned into the very thing that it despised during its inception and the years following? what i am saying is that woodpushers are the new jocks...,rollerblading was a fad for 5 years like scootering is today. skateboarding has been gnarly and going strong since the 60s. umad fruitbooter?,Raise your hand if you started skateboarding because of a video game. Raise your hand if you realize skateboarding is a shoe business.,God damn.,I'm a boarder and it's absolutely horrifying to watch people on skates do the crazy shit they do. Everything is so fucking ballsy it makes my stomach tighten up watching this shit. Fuck. What a terrifying sport.,Lol. This is true.,maybe they don't try to boardslide it because you fucked it up, because if you wax a rail and then try to boardslide it then you'll end up severing your spine on the rail by falling directly backwards,whats the hardest part of rollerblading ?,telling your parents your gay.,i've never seen a fruitbooter win a fight. faggots.,how relevant,itt: apples and oranges,Luke, get the fuck off, you have auditions to prepare for.,what would you two strange bed fellows do without each other to hate on? you're all faggots...I used to rollerblade in middleschool/highschool, then I realized i would be better off honing my skills in a real sport (football) and work hard on my studies. ,tfw fast forward 12 years later and i got a full ride scholarship to play football at a D-l university, subsequently got my masters in economics and make 100k/yr...but go ahead and keep arguing which is the superior ""sport"". you guys might as well be bickering over which gay porn star sucks better cock. faggots.,glad to see an aggressive thread. ,pic related, it's what I roll on. The og's.,obvious troll is obvious.,I played highschool football, and skated too. I still skate.,and still work in a restaurant.,did you make it to shift supervisor yet?,what the fuck did you just say to me you little bitch?,was i close?,stop being a bitch and pump harder on the tranny,keep pushing that wood you look so ""cool "" and ""gnarly"",if you dont want others to think you're gay it would probably be better to stay away from saying things like ""pump harder on the tranny"",just sayin',keep pushing that wood bro real conformity,implying i push wood,read my previous post about quitting blading 12 years ago.,I push an Audi A6 now, thanks.,Why did you post in this thread?

I don't even know how anyone thought it was a good idea. If I remember correctly the Rollerblade Chocolates had a lace up liner. I wanted those so bad for when I would skate with loose buckles. I wanted Pawn gloves too but poor and neglected by parents as a kid.,yea my rich friend had the chocolates, brown skates back then was like WTF?!?! needless to say i was jelly. i only had the julio pawn gloves as hand me downs from him when his mom bought him the pettys i believe.,He looks like Jesus. His skating progressed nicely through the years. Back in the days was really technical, stylish, and dropped hammers.

Baltimore-ish local. Not as much lately due to getting older/lack of insurance. Enjoyed some amateur competitions, filming with friends.,I love how if you see someone with a skateboard, there's a 70+% chance they don't do shit with it. You can just carry one for the image.

Sometimes I'd bring friends who don't skate to the skatepark and they would ask me why I only do one grind when I have a varied set of grinds I'm comfortable with. I don't even bother explaining to them,I've been noticing a trend of oldschool skaters getting back into it. Guys in their 30's-40's who had to give up skating for careers/families/other life obligations are now able to have more time and money to do this sort of thing again.,It's kind of like bicycling. You see a lot of guys who were into BMX in the 80's pick up all mountain riding well into their late 40's.,it's never coming back rollerblading has been culturally stigmatized. i for one dont care if it ""comes back"" as long as woodpushing companies supply wheels under my feet ill be rolling,I'm in the same boat as this guy. ,I really want to get back into skating, and take it more seriously but I have no idea where to start in terms of skates. I can handle myself on blades just fine, except for tricks and stuff. The last pair I used was one of those big, clunky, 6-wheeled monsters.,Looking at ,What would be better for a beginner who wants to learn to do some tricks and grinds, the Freestyle or the Flat? Like I said, I'm pretty good at keeping my balance and etc. as I've skated in the past, but I've never tried to grind. ,Also, looking through this thread, skating hardware looks a lot more complicated than I remember it, where can I look at skates online, and how does ordering them work? (is it better to order separate pieces or just one whole model? I don't get it) Is there a price difference between ordering parts or whole skates? I need cheap-ish ($70-120) yet reliable.,Thanks for any help I can get tonight.,http://rollerwarehouse.com/aggressi,4 wheel vs 8 wheel ,4 wheels more grind space wider turning radius ,8 wheels less grind space better turning radius increased acceleration and stability,Thank you very much,i used the razor cult street, picked em up at aggressivemall.com for 119$ theyre not bad, good for getting the basics, though i recommend buying better bearings.,i really want a pair of xsjados though, with freestyle frames,Hey guys, on a more serious note, what bearings do you suggest for speed while still remaining rigid? I've been using the budget Powerslide Twincam ILQ5 for a very long time (happened to have a large supply) and they're kind of slow (or I'm doing something wrong).,Any suggestions? I'm kind of a cheapskate (pardon the pun). Prices here are twice of those around the world. So, I'd like to stay near this budget range.,Friend of mine, was never even close but i liked inline skating alot.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUtB,Aggressivemall.com,Inlinewarehouse.com,are you even trying to be straight?,bump,If you want to grind get Xsjados with Mooks, or at least Xsjado baseplates on whatever boot you like that'll take them.,If you want to get real tech and dial your shit down perfectly only ride flat on razors or something. I have more respect for guys that do everything on flat setups but personally I'll always ride freestyle. I just like being able to grind whatever I want a bit more carelessly, it's fun because you can get away with a lot more ledge shit riding street with a flat setup.,They're incredible, but you'll have a hard time riding anything else after that. It was fine for me though, I have no problem always riding Xsjados.,lets see op's skates,OR,anyone's skates,Better yet let's see people skating. Show me some OC involving tech switch ups, hammers, mushroom blading, or general street/park shredding.,How about an old ass pic of my weak ass pornstar back in college.,I hope you're still skating. I regret quitting.,I skated a bit summer before last. I need to buy some wheels for this summer and get out there a bit.,I just got back into skateboarding a little but I'm having some stupid back issues. Just got a doctors referral for PT today so I'm really hoping I can get all that sorted out fairly quickly. Has something to do with sacroiliac inflammation or something, sucks hard.,Remember the AMA? I wasn't a pro but I made Amatuer tournament in Milwaukee and skating amongst the some of the top pros, as they were there. Met Brooke Howard Smith by the way, fukin awesome. ,And to everyone denying the technicality of fruit booting and saying it is easy, please. At the end of the day skateboarding is hard, but it looks reaaaalll stupid to see a bunch of guys flipping there wood around and not accomplishing much, when it comes down to it. Blading is just underground for the time being, and I for one don't care if it is resurrected because I have seen some of the most artistic freedoms of rollling expression that I have seen in a long while. print it.,Here's another particularly ugly one. Session with friends in downtown Pittsburgh several years ago.,I look wack in a lot of my grinds because my right shoulder is all fucked up from a skateboarding fall when I was little. Dislocated it and weakened it so it'll pop out real easy now if it goes back and out sort of, hurts like crazy and I'm always scared I won't be able to get it back in when it happens so I started holding it at my side more to keep it from flying out.,Don't hate on boards man, it looks just as bad as them hating on skates. Gotta respect everything because honestly it's all sick as hell.,I agree. No need to perpetuate this bullshit. Once you get into your 30's you find that no one cares anymore. There are more important matters in life than hating like minded people who enjoy the sensations that wheels beneath your feet bring you.,If it's your lower back, stretch your hamstrings and hips every morning. They're tensing up from skating and your back is compensating.,Word. I'm 32 and I don't give a fuck. I skate(board) and when I was 20 I skated with a rollerblader because he was my friend and I didn't care.,So if I'm a beginner with tricks, mainly grinding, would it be better to go with Freestyle or Anti-Rockers? ,I was thinking about getting the Razor Cult Street, there's Anti-Rocker and Freestyle versions. ,Also I was looking at some K2 Fatty Pro's, which are Flat.,Like I said, I'm very new to Aggressive Skating, (not skating in general) so picking the ""perfect"" skates is foreign to me. And I'm trying to be picky so I don't fuck up my first pair.,Forgot pic, here's one of the Razor ones I was looking at.,Xsjados on mooks will make everything easier all around but will make your tricks sloppier as a result. Personally? I don't think it's a huge deal because I just do it for fun. The appeal of inline for me is that a lot of it is fairly easy so I can focus on lines and flow as opposed to specific trick execution.,My first skates were anti. Remz Franky Morales with the Ground Control frames. I wasn't crazy about them because they had the weird little plastic wheels and they wouldn't even turn. Seemed to me like it was basically just a jank freestyle frame in practice.,Anti forces you to think about your grinds a bit more and will help you to learn wehre to lock your frame stuff, since theres still a defined hblock. ,All things considered though, I still don't totally understand the idea of them. It sort of gives you the grinding properties of a flat setup (if you run super hard anti wheels) without any of the riding benefits of having 8 wheels on the ground...I dunno, freestyle has always been the obvious choice for me.,One possible issue with Mooks specifically is that you have to put a groove in them to really break them in, and if you're just learning that could give you some trouble. Not really understanding your balance could cause you to start working a weird groove into them that could throw you off I guess? It's probably not a big deal to be honest.,I guess another issue with the Xsjados as a beginner skate is that they have very little ankle support which could potentially lead to injury if you're not real comfortable skating yet. Still, I think if you just wear them tight it should still be alright?,I've been doing a handful of hip related stretches I found when looking up sacroiliac issues and they've actually helped a lot. I'll start focusing on the hamstrings a bit too and see if that helps as well.,I'm hoping once I get to the PT place they're like ""oh this is no big deal we see this all the time"" and just puts me on some weight training thing or something like that. It looks like I may be able to go to a clinic specifically for sport related stuff so that's nice.,Thanks a lot for the info, really appreciate it. I think I'll go with the Razors that are freestyle for starters.,Freestyle so I can more easily practice grinding (I live in a very rural town and there's not many complicated structures or stairways to do tricks off of) ,and Razor only because they're the least costly and I don't want to sink in a ton of money right off the bat. ,Later on as I get better I'll replace the frame, or boot depending on what I see fit, then keep upgrading from there.,These were those other Razors, by the way.,So I wan't to start skating but I haven't since I was a kid, what are the cheapest skates I can get for just learning how to not fall on my ass on blades until I start to get comfortable actually skating?,No prob, I think these skates will work great for you honestly. They look dope too, I remember Razors being a lot more bland when I was getting my first skates.,Same here dude, I spent 2 nights in this thread so far trying to pick up something, I'm going with these for my beginner ones. ,I miss Friday night skate in SF at Justin Herman Plaza. That shit was the best until it got capped. Those were some of the best ledges I've ever skated. It was so cool meeting random pros and random rollerbladers from around the world. Take me back to the early 2000's please.,Not really trying to perpetuate hate, boarders won anyways at least commercailly and with popularity. I'm merely speaking on a athletic level between the two.,We gotta bring blades back.,Bring it back so that the industry doesn't die again. But, don't bring it back hard enough to sell out like skateboarding did.,Honestly? As long as the industry does well enough to exist I'm pretty happy with the scene the way it is now. The only people that hate are idiots that don't know what the fuck they're hating on. Bandwagoning morons.,""B-but I like to skateboard that means I'm supposed to hate people on skates because they're all gay"",i got some oc for you,For the industry to do well I think the pros should at least be able to make a living. I remember hearing some shit like Josh Petty had to work at Home Depot to supplement his sponsor monies to survive. Fuck that shit.,Ok yeah that's shit, I didn't know it was that bad for the pros.,i havent skated since last year, since where im from everyone is a skateboard, bikers and fucking scootering little kids, i stopped, regretting alot.,trying some trick i heard of (dont even know if real) called a scuba flip, was what i was told it is.,Everyone here skateboards, but usually it's middleschoolers and only middleschoolers. Once they grow up the get trucks and do farm stuff and drink. ,So basically if I want anyone to skate with it'd have to be my brother and his friends while they're on boards, or get some people into it.,My friend has the exact same problem...,OP Here,In love with these things. With they were higher cut, but they feel incredible. ,I personally would not suggest starting out with freestyle frames. It's going to be an uncomfortable shift if you move to flat or anti., I would suggest getting a flat setup and learning how to jump and maneuver your blades-then when you feel you are comfortable with handling, put in some anti-rocker wheels and get comfortable with more advanced grinds.,Freestyle is an entirely different feeling, whereas flat and anti are somewhat similar and standardized.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttj,Well I spent a lot of time with recreational skates as a kid, and got as keen with them as I could, i.e jumping off ledges, over stuff, etc. So I guess I'll start off with and Anti pair, because I'll get used to riding a pair of skates in general quickly. My only other question is, how do I know what size to get? My shoe size is 11-11.5US Mens, and the pair I'm thinking about getting are Razors and only come in 7 and 8.,check on ebay lots of large sizes for cheap ,just search aggressive,also flat skating will teach you how grind properly if you dont care about how your tricks look whatever,That just means they are sold out of the other sizes. Check another store.,Inlinewarehouse,Aggressivemall,Rollerwarehouse,Aggressivemall has a really good size chart which lets you know which brands require sizing up or down.,Alright sweet thanks guys,

"Hey /asp/ ,Me and a couple buds want to get into foam combat and were wondering what the best way is to break into it. I checked out the belegarth website and tried to find a local chapter but it seems their map is down and the wiki is dead.,So how do we find a group in our local area?,I hope this is the right place to ask this and I apologize if it isn't.,Not saying you're wrong here, but most LARPers usually hang out on /tg/, might help to ask there as well.,The wiki is absolutely not dead. The chapter list is still the best resource for finding a group near you.,Alternatively, post a thread in the ""New Members"" section. Might take a few days but us helpful folks will eventually get around to noticing it.,Otherwise, googling: ""boffer,"" ""boffering,"" ""medieval combat,"" ""foam fighting,"" and similar terms will be your best bet.,Also check out:,Belegath (as you know),Dargorhir (mostly for the east),Darkon (north-east),Amtgard (often lighter hitting, and individual groups are hit or miss, but there are really good high end technical fighters in it),durp, late night (*Dagorhir),We're located in western Michigan,Sorry, I just checked out the Northlands chapter near us and it's page was last updated in 2010 so I assumed the wiki was dead,Thanks for the help and I'm checking out all the options you listed,Dagorhir has a presence in MI. I worked with militia and eryndor groups at CMU.,Np. A lot of us don't frequently update our wiki pages because the information is still relevant. (Can only write so much.),I'll pass this thread along to a couple friends and see what they know about groups around there.,If I were to do it again:,My first choice would be Belegarth. Grappling and shield kicks on top of the boffer fighting. ,Amtgard is a close second, mostly because of the numbers. The local group near me gets 75 fighters on the field on a summer weekend. Faster style of fighting.,Hey OP:,A friend has some contact info for you. Throw up a post in the Newcomers board on the Bel forums, and we'll get it to you.

"So what does /asp/ think about Karate?,I've seen it mentioned in a few threads but it doesn't seem to get mentioned much here on /asp/, so I was just wondering what the rest of you guys think about Karate as a martial art? I currently practice Shotokan Karate so admittedly my opinion would be a little bit biased.,i practice kenpo and i find it to be fun and different from plain boxing or kick boxing,As a boxer and wrestler, I never was much into karate. It always seemed like too much of a phalanx art. I prefer to bob and weave, then mob in while they're off balance.,legit full contact karate is bad ass but sadly rare and its shitty for all the scam artist to be raping karate's good name. They have some crazy body blows and are legit bad asses. Look at Machida.,Karate is only good if you get full contact experience. Aside from that, it's only really effective in competition. Andy Hug and a few of the other K1 guys are probably the best example of how karate can be used effectively outside of its own context.,one must not forget machida is a 3rd degree blackbelt and has been doing it for at least a decade,what ufc fighter hasnt fought at least 10 years?,many people here seem to be under the impression that karate is limited to people standing in front of a mirror doing kata, shadow boxing, and practicing choreographed combinations.,This likely stems from them getting scammed when they were 5 years old by the place that opened up in the mall, they take that experience and assume all teachers share that training style.,some even go so far as to say if you don""t do nothing but kata then you aren't actually training karate, these are generally the MMA master style!!!!! pride themselves on boasting ignorance and acting like tough blowhards.,If you do nothing but kata, you aren't learning how to fight, you are learning the form. Form instructs you on the 'proper' way to perform a technique, not on the realities of trying to perform a technique on a resisting opponent. That is what sparring is for, it teaches you how people are going to react, what you need to do to enable your techniques and it develops your timing and instincts. Karate isn't BS or anything, its just not taught very effectively in most styles (outside of Kyokushin).,I practiced Wado Ryu for 9 years and Shotokan for about a year and a half.,It's very useful if you get to practice kumite and general sparring since there are a lot grappling techniques and other stuff than kicks and punches, but if you only get to do katas then (as it's already been said) it's completely worthless.,which had nothing to do with the generalization at the end of it,People hate on Karate because of Kata but they are forgetting, or don't know, about Bunkai. This is where each Kata's tecnique is analyzed with sparring partners, highlighting the effectiveness of the moves. They cover very many possible situations. Then you add to this Kumite and all in all it's good training. ,I myself did it for many years right up until a week before my 2nd Dan test, but I got injured. After some introspection, I moved on to Muay Thai which is what I continue to do now. I feel like the Karate however prepared me very well for where I am now, physically and mentally.,Shotokan is rarely good; can be so if you have a legit teacher who does full contact sparring and stuff.,Kyokushin is where its at. ,Generally Shotokan fighters are bad but there are a few great one (like machida), but Kyokushin fighters are always at least pretty good.,Forms aren't needless, otherwise you won't understand the way to perform the technique. I just wish that more dojos would teach in the old ways, not in a manner that is designed simply to get as manyvpeople through the doors I had a similar look at myself with Judo.,as long as they are fighting people that have trouble defending body shots, since they don't punch the head.,you ever watch them fight? it's flat out silly, they just whale on each other until the match is over,I just want to know, what got you guys into Karate? I'm sure I'm gonna sound like a faggot, but the reason I started Boxing is because of Hajime no Ippo, and I'm curious as to what got others into martial arts.,Far, far too many martial arts movies and initially a desire to be badass. It wasn't karate, but still.,I wanted to learn how to kickbox because I passed by a kickboxing gym and it seemed like fun,my teacher was a flake and kind of shitty so after I learned the basics I went to a different place which was closer to my house,the owner of said place was 60 years old and a 7th dan karateka that took on students here and there, he was watching me sparring with one of his students who was a trainer there and afterwards he offered to start teaching me..and the rest is history.,he did not run a formal karate school, he ran a gym and we would meet after hours to train. He had very few students and he said he picked people that he knew would pass the knowledge and training forward to others in the future.,which I do,I watched my dad practice at his club when I was about 4. ,I started when I was about 10, but I had already spent a couple of years on Judo at that point. The Judo club was over an hour away and we didn't have a lot of members (only me and my mother's coworker's son except for 2 blackbelts and the instructor) so I eventually quit and focused more on Karate.,It would get you killed in a real fight, IMO.,go on,Nice quads, but I'd like to hear the theory behind your opinion. Captcha: imply ingamont,all that fancy shit would get you stabbed or shot by some random bath salt nigger.,Try a crane kick? SHANKED,Try a BS kata? CRACK there goes your jaw by an untrained haymaker.,Teaching yourself skills makes you weaker to any unskilled thug.,In a real fight, people don't nicely wait for you to do your jump kicks and wacky hand maneuvers. It very quickly devolves into wailing on each other, groin hitting, eye gouging, and tackling.,You obviously haven't been in a Karate class. Crane kick? I practice Shotokan and never ever done that shit.,And actually using a Kata in a fight? You'd have to be some sort of retard to try that.,And a Haymaker? A quick ag yuki would block that and the counters are up to you. (empi, etc),The only legit karate is Kyokushin and styles that derive from it like Shidokan, Enshin, Ashihara, Seidojuku, etc. Why? Because they practice knockdown karate. They condition their shins, knees, and hands while sparring hardcore. ,Back in 1964, Kyokushin was the ONLY karate style that successfully competed against Thai boxers.,Andy Hug, Bas Rutten, and GSP trained Kyokushin karate. ,This is what it looks like:,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gpu,In Shotokan we don't practice ""wacky hand maneuvers"" or any of that shit, at least not at my dojo. My sensei also teaches ground tactics and take downs. Although I do see your point being valid with a style such as Wado Ryu.,The problem with karate is that it got popularized too quickly in the 70's and 80's. You have too many black belt factories and McDojos were little emphasis on actual training is given. Instead, we have too many out-of-shape fatasses teaching people to do horse stances and punch in the air. ,You don't have this with Muay Thai too often because you HAVE to spar and hit the bags/pads. ,Basically, the ideal martial art whether striking or grappling needs to be like boxing or wrestling when you train. If it's a striking art, if you're not learning how to hit as well as take hits, you're learning shit. The same for grappling since you NEED a resisting partner when training.,Which is why I love my dojo, my sparring partner is fucking brutal, a cool guy, but when sparring he will fuck me up if my head isn't in it.,you're going to get punched in the jaw by anyone else if you try to use that shit,so it looks exactly like every other kind of karate, got it,They practice face-punching and kicks/knees to the face. This is only for tournaments. ,Other karate doesn't hit with the shins and knees like Kyokushin does. After fighting against Muay Thai, they picked up on shin conditioning.,don't exist in karate,blocking?,both bread and butter karate techniques,impossible to do to someone well trained in karate unless they are significantly outweighed,oh okay, then you guys are actually going to fuck everyone's day up.,This stuff makes me wish fencing was actually at all practical D:,Goju-ryu does,This. Especially Shotokan which specialises in deep stances. Tackles would be virtually impossible.,LOL, go back and watch the first UFC's, and see how the Gracies owned all the traditional Karatekas with takedowns.,UFC doesn't replicate a fight against a thug or mugger. We're talking fighting in the street not on the mat or in the ring.,This. You wouldn't be fighting against trained fighters in the street if you were a humble martial artist.,Do you actually believe this? You need to engage in full-contact training if you do.,Bullshit. Plenty of strikers won in the early UFC. Hell, UFC 1 had a Karate/Savate guy named Gerard Gordeau against Royce Gracie.,Yeah, neither do your katas. Do yourself a favor, instead of drinking your sensei's kool-aid, pad up and see if it works in full-contact. If it doesn't, don't do it.,and then when Royce Gracie fought Kazushi Sakuraba in a legitimate no rules fight he was absolutely massacred, flat out embarrassed.,Yes, and Royce beat him. What's your point?,If you aren't a skinny runt and actually assume a proper stance, I believe it.,what do you think a kata is for, dumbass? it is a warm up exercise.,It has already been mentioned, Katas are the formal side of Karate and only a fucking retard would use a Kata in a fight.,Walls make getting out of ground fighting situations easier, you jave another plane to leverage against them. The canvas is clear of obstacles such as dirt, sand, glass, lava, acid and industrial grade rape lubricant, making your footing more secure as well. Your stance will not prevent takedowns, you can still be single or double legged, hip tossed and tripped.,And Royce beat him in the rematch.,Not really, the cage (you can evade a takedown by leaning onto it), its size (ample room to evate takedowns with good footwork), its format (no hard corners to trap you when backpedalling from a takedown attempt), the time limits and the standups all favor strikers.,you are aware that TACKLE is the word that was used, not take down,also,you have that backwards, it makes the take down easier because you can push them against a wall which takes away their ability to hold a wide stance,and tested positive for steroids after the fight. He literally had to cheat to win.,Would you talk like that in your dojo? No? They why show that kind of disrespect here?,We're trying to build /asp/ as a place where martial artists can come and communicate with each other with respect. Try not to shit it up like the other boards.,I wasn't the guy that was positively responding to you guys but I was the poster of the original comment you were responding to. First and foremost, the modern idea of ""blocking"", karate being rather modern as it's only about 100-150 years old, is absurdly flawed. It is based on the assertion that combat is easy. What do I mean? There's an individual block for each individual attack. This suggests that the user of Karate, while in combat, would not only be calm enough to consider exactly what kind of attack is being thrown at him, but would also have enough time to think over the 100's of techniques he's learned to pick the correct one and then employ said block. That's the first issue with the blocking. I'll continue in the next post so that I don't just throw out a huge wall of text that nobody is going to read.,I wasn't showing any disrespect. I wasn't calling you a retard, I was simply stating only someone with a screw loose would attempt to do a kata during a real fight, I'm not in my dojo so I swore, the only sign of slight disrespect in that statement.,Continued from: ,So, the next issue with the blocking is that it's a bunch of wasted movement. Assuming that you were the kind of superman who would be able to throw out the exact block for the exact attack being thrown, you would still be left in a position, most often inside of the enemy's attack, with little to follow up with outside of some basic striking. Assuming your opponent is half trained, which it is safe to assume because everybody is training in something these days, most prominently boxing, he would know to get out of the way or to try to perry and counter. So, you're left with nothing but the same blocking motion in an infinite exchange of wasted effort with this individual. That is, of course, the best case scenario, because he probably has friends that are going to come up behind you and kick your teeth out as soon as it looks like he isn't dominating the situation. The warrior should strive to attack and to defend in one efficient motion. A great example of this would be the application of deflections and receptions, seen in more traditional Japanese martial arts like Dakentaijutsu. That's my other issue with the blocking.,Although, I apologise if you took offense. You should have read more carefully because it was not aimed at you.,90% of people you will get into a fight with are going to throw a big sloppy haymaker, there is not much thought in stopping that and the block should have a punch released from the other hand with both hitting at the same time.,Then lock up, knees, chokes, throws, and sweeps are all on the table.,Continued from: ,Let's consider some other aspects of Karate. First, the striking. Most of the punches, much like in other modern martial arts, under-utilize some of the more effective power sources in your body, namely tai ate (full body motion), haragaei (expression of the abdominal muscles), and koshi mawari (twisting of the body). Some of these certainly are utilized, but when done, it is through great lowering of your own defenses. Along with that, the majority of strikes in Karate are thrown at your opponents front. Along with under-utilizing flanking as a path to avoiding blocks or dodges, it also fails to take advantage of sensitive points in the body that can't take as much damage as the face or stomach and chest might i.e. the cerebral cortex, jaw hinge, and temple.,yall niggas no nutin about fighting you niggas be backflippin and shit and us hood niggas wud fuck yall niggas up,While I agree with you, I'd have to point out that people actually throw combos of wild haymakers which your average pre coordinated blocks are going to fail to disrupt. On top of that, since they are wild, it's hard to know where the blows will be landing. ,However, I was trained to believe that the superman method should be used when considering an opponent in a street fight. Meaning that he can take more pain than you can and is stronger and faster than you are. This is well exemplified if you consider fighting somebody on meth or PCP.,Continued from: ,The final thing I would like to say about striking in Karate is that it's too much work for too little gain. The amount of energy it takes to throw enough strikes to take somebody out is gargantuan. If we consider a boxing match, it's very rare to see somebody get knocked out in the first few minutes. The more likely event is that hundreds of punches are thrown by each fighter until somebody goes down. And that's just a boxing match. Nobody can train to stop from getting knocked out when it happens, unless your head is particularly large, the amount it takes to take somebody out with striking is not that subjective. Now, if we consider a life or death situation and what happens in the brain when somebody's life is threatened, i.e. a huge release of adrenaline and endorphins to significantly raise your opponent's tolerance for pain, not to mention their strength, speed, and stamina, striking becomes a moot point. ,Also to consider, a lot of Karate striking seems to be based on making contact with the back of your hand or the front of your foot. These are two of the weakest sets of bones in your body and you run an extremely high risk of simply breaking your own hand or foot by accidentally striking your opponent's knees or elbows.,Should I continue?,Please do.,Continued from: ,It should be made clear here that I view Karate as awesome in a sports setting. Lyoto Machida employs it very well in UFC, which I also love as a sport. ,Now, that whole rant was all about Kyokushin Karate. There are, however, other forms that employ aspects of grappling and joint locking. It should be first stated that there is a lack of emphasis on small joint manipulation, i.e. finger manipulation. Small joint manipulation is an excellent way to transition into large joint manipulation, but we can get into that later. Let's focus on the traditionally viewed application of Karate in striking as it transitions into joint locking. I was talking about flanking while striking in an earlier post, so if I would refer you to that bit before reading on. Or you can not, whatever you want. ,Flanking while striking does not only allow you to strike in places you normally wouldn't have access to, it also puts you in something called dominant positioning. If an individual is in dominant positioning, it means he is outside of his opponents attack, in a comfortable position after a deflection or a reception, and ideally in a position to proceed with a joint lock, whether it be fingers, wrist, forearm, elbow, shoulder, spine, whatever really. Striking, believe it or not, is one of the keys to joint locking. It not only has the potential to put you into dominant positioning from which you can use your body weight to dominate your opponent without having to expend a shit load of energy, it also momentarily stuns your opponent (if you're approaching this using the superman theory). If you've ever watched an mma match in which one guy is trying to submit the other, it becomes clear that locking is a relatively difficult thing to do. So, we have to assume that in order to break some bones, which render your opponent unable to move various portions of their bodies regardless of their strength or what drug their on, you would first need,Continued from: ,strike them a bunch of times. ,Most forms of Karate approach locking from their opponents' front and without trying to stun the opponent first, but rather throwing a few meager strikes their way that would only serve to anger them. On top of that, much like with striking, full body motion is under-utilized and you end up with two people using as much strength as they can to lock the other person up, which only serves to fatigue them, especially in the situation (using the superman method, we're assuming this is every situation) where your opponent has friends that are coming to help him. This is especially important if your trying to break bones or even succeed, in which case they'll be trying to really hurt you instead of just rough you up. This is a bit that I can get into later.,bamp,Bemp,Personally I like karate because I find it the most enjoyable to practice on my own. I follow along with a kihon dvd, do kata, hit a heavybag/do some whacko body conditioning stuff in replacement of free sparring. I pay a mat fee to join a class when I get the urge but I'm generally satisfied training on my own now.,dangerous art if you know how to use it...,Get off you high horse, More people are likely to get fucked up by a well timed hook/elbow/judo throw than from most elegant karate attacks,It's a great way to train your body, It's not a great way to learn how to fight.,I suck at posting.,If you actually looked at Karate you'd realise that Katas are the most elegant thing about it. And like it's been mentioned, no-one in their right mind uses Katas in real fights or sparring.,don't bother, they are all really jealous they don't have blackbelts. They put in a lot of time in their craft too but they have nothing physical to show for it, you can say I know how to kickbox and people will think ""yeah..who doesn't I do kickboxing with my personal trainer every Saturday, or I take a kickboxing class to stay in shape"" but if you say you have a blackbelt people think ""oh wow, this guy is fucking awesome"",It is pure unadulterated jelly and nothing more because nobody takes what they do seriously, so they desperately try to justify their choices to themselves by making assumptions about the classes they never took.,Can you imagine how deadly a martial arts master would be on PCP? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4E,you know shit was on because he dropped the chucks,naw son, Imma do it muhself,This is the most retarded, egocentric thing I've ever read. ,Anon, what the hell are you talking about? Doesn't anything beyond image matter to you? Your black belt might signify that you're ready to fight real challengers which, from the sound of it, you're not. All you're doing is hurting yourself. How long does it take to get a black belt in Karate? 1-2 years? Less if you pay your instructor more? ,I've been in my martial art, also Japanese, and I'm about to earn my second belt after a shit load of work. I have a feeling that I could tear you apart.,for 3 years*,took me 11 years to reach first dan,We don't even get regular yearly belt tests for promotions, you get a promotion when he feels you are ready for it.,What's the point of this? I could write a manga that says ""X"" technique always works as well.,do it faggot,I understand what you mean but a Black belt to me signifies that a person is a master of basics and ready to start on more advanced techniques, etc. And you say less if you pay your Sensei more? You're referring to the McDojo ""Pay me $100 and you'll be a black belt"" way. Black belt isn't just a belt, it's a state of mind and anyone who walks around feeling they can ""tear people apart"" without seeing them at least training then that person is nowhere near this Black Belt mentality.,A belt is just a piece of cloth used to keep your pants up.,I really hate that quote because it doesn't keep your pants up, it keeps your jacket closed,Which is exactly what I have just explained, in a different context.,My jacket has laces to keep it closed and my pants are elasticated so mine does neither.,my jacket has them too but they always manage to come undone, actually my main jacket the laces ripped off from throws and stuff.,my main pants have a draw string, the elastic pants I have had were the light fabric and always ripped,Yeah, my secondary gi jacket's laces ripped off too. My main's been going strong for a while now though.,I studied Shotokan for several years. Loved it.,Wrong!,It's fictitious but in theory it works.,No, it makes a bunch of assumptions, such as the pain being severe enough to stop his takedown, or that his opponent couldn't simply continue his motion and end up behind him instead of floating there. Now, liver shots hurt like hell and make you feel like you want to die, but that doesn't mean that they magically stop grappling just because they are painful in application, that of course assumes thatvhe can accurately bring his elbow down on his liver in the first place. If someone is lunging at you, ripping your balance out from under you and shoving you backwards all at the same time it can make it veryvhard to keep your footing And aim an accurate shot.,Lyoto Machida and Katsunori Kikuno are two of my favorite MMA fighters who have a major karate influence. Now i am not saying they only use Karate BUT both of them use karate concepts and techniques in full contact combat sports like MMA.,you should watch some Andy Hug, Glaube Feitosa, Francisco Filho, Keiji Ozaki and Seiji Takahashi fights,All of these people who think that the only aspect of a martial art is learning how to fight. I pity them.,I mean, sure, it's a big aspect, but it's not everything.,Also, sparring isn't necessary to learn a martial art. It's just another drill. You can do two-person exercises and forms and be able to defend yourself just as well.,OP, you'll do fine learning Karate. It's a well balanced martial art and I suspect you'll have a lot of fun. Chances are any fight you'll get into is going to be a barfight or something, so the other guy probably won't be some kind of judo champion.,inb4 tournaments, UFC, MMA. I don't believe in having rules while fighting, and I don't learn my martial arts so I can use them as some kind of lowly sport.,So you eye-gouge, bite, snap bones and break faces every time you practice? Oh, wait but you dont have to try hard or get hurt to learn how to defend yourself, just like how you can learn how you can learn how to drive a car by reading about it in a book. If you need mystical, authority based pupil and master relationships to learn a martial style, then fine. Dont pretend you're superior just because you don't like the sight of you own blood.,You are foolish. Your comparison is invalid and you should be ashamed.,Take traditional Okinawan Karate, traditional Kung Fu, or many other martial arts. All extremely deadly, but almost 100% kata/form practice and very RARELY any sparring.,Yes, there are two-person forms. They teach you how to apply your moves in combat.,Yes, there are two-person exercises. They teach you to have better reaction time and also condition you.,When I practice my two-person forms, I motion to eye-gouge, break bones, manipulate joints, dislocate elbows, etc. While in practice, ONLY strength is held back, not technique. We do constant conditioning exercises to make sure that we'll be able to apply the strength when we need to.,Many martial arts schools now will train people to do well in tournaments or MMA, teaching them only techniques that will do well in point sparring, and none of those moves that are banned from tournament sparring matches. My teacher once explained to me when I inquired about joining tournaments:,""That is just sport. We don't practice that here. Every tournament we've been to, we've been disqualified from."",This is the mentality I keep while practicing martial arts. Would you believe that some people actually believe that wearing gloves that prevent you from proper joint manipulation, training to hit anything but the face, and staying up until the next round are pure representations of their martial art?,How disappointing.,You just say things and expect them to be taken as truth. Two-Person forms do not teach you how to fight, they teach you the feel of the technique, but not the actual execution of it under non-ideal conditions. ,The strength and accuracy at speed are the hard parts, any one can practice a tecunique without strength or intent, because without them they are nothing more than particulairly complicated dance moves.,You guys are cowards, unable to adapt to a set of rules to test your art. There are more forms of competition besides UFC, for example there is the brazilian tradition of Vale Tudo, which allows many of the very strikes that your style is so practiced at. Karate didn't do well there either.,You are peaceful warriors, yet you can't abide by the rules that you agreed to.,Two-person forms do teach you how to fight. I know this from personal experience. It also teaches you to display your art properly instead of resorting to kickboxing techniques like most martial arts schools do while sparring.,Yes, because it sure shows a lack of intent when you only hit someone on the elbow instead of breaking it.,Half of the attacks I've been taught are small joint locks, strikes to the eyes, throat, and groin attacks. I mean, sure, I COULD very well go into tournament play, but would it show the extent of my ability? No. Do I want people judging me based on something that isn't my best? No.,I never said ""we're too deadly,"" just that most of our techniques are banned. There's literally no point in doing it if you can't do it 100%.",,"03/31/13(Sun)04:39,03/31/13(Sun)04:44,03/31/13(Sun)05:25,03/31/13(Sun)05:43,03/31/13(Sun)05:44,03/31/13(Sun)05:55,03/31/13(Sun)08:34,03/31/13(Sun)11:01,03/31/13(Sun)12:05,03/31/13(Sun)12:39,03/31/13(Sun)12:44,03/31/13(Sun)13:10,03/31/13(Sun)13:19,03/31/13(Sun)13:23,03/31/13(Sun)13:24,03/31/13(Sun)13:37,03/31/13(Sun)13:55,03/31/13(Sun)14:02,03/31/13(Sun)14:08,03/31/13(Sun)14:24,03/31/13(Sun)15:42,03/31/13(Sun)16:04,03/31/13(Sun)17:05,03/31/13(Sun)17:07,03/31/13(Sun)17:07,03/31/13(Sun)17:11,03/31/13(Sun)17:14,03/31/13(Sun)17:14,03/31/13(Sun)17:18,03/31/13(Sun)17:23,03/31/13(Sun)17:25,03/31/13(Sun)17:26,03/31/13(Sun)17:27,03/31/13(Sun)17:29,03/31/13(Sun)17:30,03/31/13(Sun)17:30,03/31/13(Sun)17:31,03/31/13(Sun)17:33,03/31/13(Sun)17:36,03/31/13(Sun)17:38,03/31/13(Sun)17:39,03/31/13(Sun)17:40,03/31/13(Sun)17:40,03/31/13(Sun)17:42,03/31/13(Sun)17:42,03/31/13(Sun)17:43,03/31/13(Sun)17:43,03/31/13(Sun)17:44,03/31/13(Sun)17:44,03/31/13(Sun)17:45,03/31/13(Sun)17:46,03/31/13(Sun)17:48,03/31/13(Sun)17:49,03/31/13(Sun)17:49,03/31/13(Sun)17:50,03/31/13(Sun)17:51,03/31/13(Sun)17:52,03/31/13(Sun)17:54,03/31/13(Sun)17:58,03/31/13(Sun)17:58,03/31/13(Sun)18:06,03/31/13(Sun)18:07,03/31/13(Sun)18:13,03/31/13(Sun)18:13,03/31/13(Sun)18:21,03/31/13(Sun)18:32,03/31/13(Sun)18:35,03/31/13(Sun)19:03,03/31/13(Sun)19:12,03/31/13(Sun)19:38,04/01/13(Mon)01:19,04/01/13(Mon)05:14,04/01/13(Mon)07:27,04/01/13(Mon)07:48,04/01/13(Mon)07:49,04/01/13(Mon)10:47,04/01/13(Mon)12:39,04/01/13(Mon)12:57,04/01/13(Mon)13:09,04/01/13(Mon)13:22,04/01/13(Mon)13:23,04/01/13(Mon)13:27,04/01/13(Mon)14:36,04/01/13(Mon)14:37,04/01/13(Mon)14:38,04/01/13(Mon)14:47,04/01/13(Mon)14:50,04/01/13(Mon)15:22,04/01/13(Mon)15:31,04/01/13(Mon)15:32,04/01/13(Mon)15:34,04/01/13(Mon)15:35,04/01/13(Mon)15:53,04/01/13(Mon)15:58,04/01/13(Mon)16:57,04/01/13(Mon)18:42,04/01/13(Mon)19:02,04/01/13(Mon)19:14,04/01/13(Mon)19:20,04/01/13(Mon)19:32,04/01/13(Mon)19:42,04/01/13(Mon)19:50,04/01/13(Mon)20:01,04/01/13(Mon)20:06,04/01/13(Mon)20:18,04/01/13(Mon)20:59,04/01/13(Mon)21:17","Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"

"So, I have a black belt in Tae Kwon Do and I'm a newfag at brazilian jiu jitsu, and did wrestling in high school. I don't practice TKD anymore, though.,I want to learn more about how to fight while standing up. What I know from Tae Kwon Do just isn't that helpful, and I want to get into more MMA type stuff.,The gym I'm currently at offers both Muay Thai and Jeet Kune Do classes. Which one is more useful for fighting and MMA type competitions?,As far as advice I would offer:,Tae Kwon Do is nice for people who want a very traditional martial art with memorized forms and more traditional elements like philosophy and lots of bowing. Go to a World TaeKwonDo Federation studio, though, it's the kind they do in the Olympics. They do full contact sparring (with pads), so you actually learn somewhat useful skills. The no-contact ITF does is lame.,BJJ: BJJ is a great sport for people who want to learn how to grapple. A lot like wrestling, but going to submission instead of pin. The community is usually pretty good and friendly and very helpful. ,Wrestling is a good choice if you're in high school or college because it's easy to access. It's an amazing workout and you will get very fit. The skills aren't totally applicable to a fight but it's a great sport for sports sake.,I'm here to answer questions about these sports if you want me to answer them from what I know.,So which is it?,train muay thai. jeet kune do is a fucking joke unless you are a bruce lee-loving twink,Seemed to me that they were both relevant, but standup fighting is more relevant at this point since I'm still a newbie at grappling, MMA would be way down the line once I know more about both.,What country are you from OP?,For the stand-up element of MMA you should go with Muay Thai - assuming it's a legit Muay Thai school and not just some cardio kickboxing gym calling itself Muay Thai to get more attention.,OP Here, USA,I think it's a legitimate program, but how do I tell?,Muay Thai is what you are looking for, should fit in nicely with the BJJ and TKD don't forget to wrestle though.,Muay Thai is the way to go. Easier out of the box and more effective, the shit about jeet kune do and all other martial arts for that matter is you have to be a master to do any harm, muay thai on the other hand if effective even for beginners.,you can tell if its just some gay aerobics place if theres a bunch of good looking chicks in the class. I had female at my muay thai gym but they were all dykes.,Dropping in to tell the OP that he is clueless.,BB in TKD means nothing.,I've been training for 20 years and people who ask me about how to choose a martial art get one simple answer:,-> Judo 5 years and Boxing (no sparring) 5 years,Doesn't matter what you want to do later or what you are interested in, this core 10 years of training will make you fit and give you all the basic knowledge to tell bullshit and fakes from the real deal.,Just to clarify, I fully acknowledge that TKD is shit for actual fighting, but it is a decent cardio workout. I fucking hate forms with a passion though, because they don't show off anything beyond your ability to memorize a form.,If you're looking for good stand up and have good cardio health you may want to consider kickboxing.,Judo and boxing offer conflicting principles, though. One is about full body movement and the other is about crossing yourself all of the time.,I'm pretty sure OP and this guy are equally clueless.,dammit, /asp/.,There you go. MuayThai OP.,Book it. Done.,boxing and judo go hand to hand. we've seen plenty of fighters combine techniques from both to feed off the other. For example using the momentum of a jab or cross to explode off an osoto gari (outside leg trip) or morote gari,im a black belt in tae kwon do and i'm a total pussy,bye /asp/ies have fun,Well, that's a good start I guess.,Doesn't matter. You are going to spend the next 10 years unlearning all your Boxing and Judo habits anyway.,Those first 10 years are about sparring, fitness, and competition.,Once you are past that you can get serious about martial arts.,Can someone explain to me the difference between Muay Thai and Kickboxing?,Not only that, but what's the difference when it comes to punching between Muay Thai and normal boxing?,Lolwut,Muay Thai practices clinching more along with landing knees and elbows. There are also cultural things like the wai kru that go along with MT. As for the punching, Muay Thai uses a much different stance than boxing which I feel is the main difference. Another thing is that unless you do serious damage with them, punches aren't scored as highly as kicks/knees/elbows. A lot of MT fighters mainly throw their hands to set up their kicks.,bjj/mtk fag here,the ""best"" martial arts will be the nearest school that gets you sparring regularly and doesnt neglect either striking or grappling,traditional muay thai involves holding you arms up and bracketing your face to get punched, great art and all but ill take a pass on the broken face,boxing keeps your face protected,Judo and boxing is all you need for unarmed. ,It is awesome.,You're in luck that you have a background in wrestling. You'll be able to control a lot of people in your jiu jitsu classes, and it should also be difficult to be taken down. ,As someone who has a primarily striking background, my best advice that I can give you is to 1)train at an actual boxing gym and 2)practice other striking arts separately and work at fine-tuning/mastering them before mixing them. This is especially true with boxing. You want to go to a real boxing gym so that you can be taught the nuances of boxing like quick foot work, sleek head movement, and most importantly--the jab.,Obviously, learn how to check and throw kicks. This will require you to square up your stance, however once you've mastered throwing punches from the boxing stance, it shouldn't take you too long to adjust and find your power in your modified stance. ,Oh, and of course--watch the Charley Burley video. It's a good start for fundamentals in boxing. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81n,Fuck off, you have no idea what you're talking about.,This place is as bad as Sherdog already.,OP, here are some of the more important things I learned from boxing.,As long as you are controlling the fight (ie the opponent is following/reacting to your movement), use lateral movement (either direction works) to make your opponent reset his feet. After you've caused him to reposition three or four times (and each time, continued to run), stop, and move straight in while he is resetting his feet. In order to reset his feet, he will have to have one foot off of the ground. If he has only one foot on the ground, he cannot throw a hard shot (to boxing standards, at least), nor can he effectively block a punch. In boxing, you have to have both feet under you to effectively block a punch, otherwise the punch will likely go through your guard, no matter how hard you are trying to cover up.,Example: Bernard Hopkins vs Kelly Pavlik ,This one is pretty self-explanatory. Which each step, you have the potential to throw a punch. Also, when you throw a punch with your right hand, you set up your hips to swing back and throw a punch with your left, and so on and so forth. Don't get a habit in throwing in a predictable rhythm though (ie only right-left-right-left) Make sure you make them snap, and that you practice pushing off with your back foot while moving forward, and your front foot moving backwards. ,If your opponent throws a left jab, you block it with your right hand. When you do so, do not let your fist move more than an inch away from your face. Why? Because they can always feint a jab and throw a left hook. If your hand gets too far away from your face, you will NOT be able to bring it back in time. This is really hard to get over at first, but think about it--if the punches aren't coming within an inch or two of your face, why bother even trying to block them?,Is anyone else interested in the spiritual/disciplinary facet of martial arts anymore? In other words, the philosophical aspect of martial arts?,Ever since this MMA craze that hit us in the late 90s/early 2000s, everyone pretty much forgot about the philosophical aspect in many martial arts.,When I was younger, I trained in Shotokan and we had to begin every class bowing, reciting a mantra that basically instilled confidence, discipline and respect into each of us. Then, we warmed up by jogging around for like fifteen minutes, doing stretches for another ten and then conditioning. After that, we practiced our forms, kicking/punching/defending correctly, etc. We usually ended by bowing, reciting something positive again and then respecting each of our competitors/teammates by shaking their hand or something.,It feels as if Martial Arts in the modern era has lost this facet. I went into an MMA gym the other day and it was filled with guys with tattoos over half their bodies, cursing, people trying to actually hurt another person, etc.,Also, for many of you who stay that you hate 'forms,' or katas, I loved them. It was built on muscle memory and memorization, sure, but they generally instilled discipline. It was this same discipline that I put into my school work and I'm currently in an graduate program in my field of study.,Kind of sucks that we have a shitload of meatheads who are doing martial arts, but not really taking advantage of the philosophical aspect of it anymore.,Well, if you go into an MMA gym that's what you're gonna see. The MMA culture doesn't spend a lot of time on the philosophy at all.,If you go to a Karate/TKD/Kung Fu gym, you will typically see a lot of the more philosophical/formal elements.,BJJ/Muay Thai/Wrestling/Boxing, which seem to be pretty popular nowadays, all are more competition based martial arts, and are the ones most likely to be seen in MMA type gyms and competitions, which produced the boom you see today. People want the thrill of competition, of being the best, more than they want the zen type stuff. ,Depending on the gym you go to, even MMA gyms can have a different sense of camaraderie about them. You normally won't see a lot of people being full-on douchebags, though. I know in BJJ classes everyone is normally really helpful and friendly. Wrestling is a school activity, normally, so you get the team element there.,I don't know a lot about boxing or MT, though, so I can't speak to the camaraderie there.,I was just about to ask this question OP.,What is a good discipline ot learn at my age?,By that I mean one that is moderatly accessible and can actually tech me useless things. ,Besides Karate, I never liked Karate as a kid.,I am in Community College and I am 21.,If you're looking for useful, you probably wanna look at one of the grappling/throwing arts (wrestling, bjj, judo) or one of the useful striking arts (boxing, muay thai, some kickboxing classes),I usually recommend people start with a grappling art because it's normally safer to practice with intensity and you can spar 100% more often.,You said wrestling asn't really all that useful. At least OP did.,Can I still even wrestle anymore right now at my age or does it die after school?,wrestling can be very useful if combined with something else,Wrestling is not that useful by itself in a self defense type situation because you train to pin, not to submit. But it is very good for conditioning and learning a lot of the basics of grappling.,It used to be that wrestling was something that continued after school, but since they took it out of the Olympics it's not as competitive. There are grappling clubs and various wrestling groups you can likely find in your area though.,I think wrestling appeals to me just because I like professional wrestling.,What about martial arts?,I never really like Karate when I was a kid but I think that was because I wasn't as disciplined as I am now.,You take someone down ""on the street"" and they get hit with concrete. Wrestling is liable to kill someone.,No matter what the situation, BJJ is the most useful single martial art to have knowledge of in a street fight.,In MMA, the best combination is BJJ, Muay Thai, and some wrestling.,Do wing chun,/thread,Top lel m8,Boxing is liable to kill someone.,BAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA!,Oh look, a faggot,You guys are just unable to handle any criticism. Look, the problems with wing chun are in its linear footwork (especially ,When compared to traditional boxing), the fact that it uses uncommitted strikes which lack power. They have no ground game whatsoever and they are very concerned with sensitivity for strikes, but th way that they train it pertains primarily to WC, not to striking as a whole.,I don't know what they teach in Netherlands, if it's considered Muay Thai or kickboxing, but the Dutch dominate the Muay Thai and kickboxing scene,Just watched some 9 fight Serb beat a 150 fight Thai the other day,They emphasize striking with your fists a lot more in comparison to the thai schools, who are more concerned with clinching and getting off a flurry of knees,Yeah, I noticed the Serb got a lot of punches in,Though he did knock him down a few times and KO him with a kick,where are all the Dutch Lumpini champions then? They definitely dominate in organizations like K-1 and Glory, but that's not Muay Thai.,You can still practice Muay Thai in those tournaments, much like how people practice MT in UFC and such. Honestly I don't know why the dutch haven't shown up more.,Its a fact that Thailand discriminates against foreigners. They only reason you dont see foreign champs in government run tournaments like Lumpini is because the Thais discriminate trying to protect the purity of their sport. We are talking about the same government that bans MMA and grappling so their style stays pure,Distance is too far and not worth the pay?,Constructive criticism is good. Laughing like a faggot is not.,Now, you raise some interesting points, but I have to disagree with some of them.,Wing chun is a close-range fighting style. It comes into play when the distance between the opponents have already been closed-off so much so, that footwork doesn't matter. The distance one fights in in wing chun is almost chest-to-chest range; there's not space to move around like in a boxing ring. That being said, there is lots of footwork in Wing Chun too. However, that's primarily to bridge the gap between the opponent, and enter Wing Chun range.,I disagree again. Certainly, the power does not come from the shoulder or hip like in traditional boxing. The problem with a shoulder-initiated punch is that it's a committed wild strike, which even a trained boxer has no control of. A good wing chun practitioner should easily be able to shut down committed strikes when they start or use stepping and blocking to send the committed puncher flying in another direction.,The power in the wing chun strike comes from 2 places: (1) Since the punch originates from the center, the full weight of the body is behind it, (2) with the momentum of forward stepping movement while the punch is being delivered.,That's definitely a weakness of the style, I admit. However, do note that wing chun is not a ""game"" martial art. The point is to take out your opponent as quickly as possible, before he/she realizes what's happening and get the fuck away. It's an all-or-nothing survival fighting system, not a ring/competition/sport fighting style. A good wing chun practitioner should be able to take out his opponent and leave before it even turns into a ground shitfest.,Yes, but the rules in those organizations gimp Thai fighters by putting a very short time limit on clinching and banning elbows, which cause the most knockouts in Thailand.,I believe that there is little distinction between sport and traditional arts, considering how well many 'traditonal' styles have done in competitions. I feel your point about the footwork is a dodge,it is the same issue as any purist in an art falls to: you assume that you are allowed to dictate the aspect in which you fight. Its the same point you hear BJJ purists raise, but for close-striking. If i figure your style out, ill try to dent you it,same as you would try your hardest not to get clinched by someone who knew Muay Thai. ,Now I don't believe that a punch is controlled from a boxer, those motions are drilled a simply fantastic amount, and one of the primary skills related to punching is the ability to be percise in your delivery in both distance and location.,Sorry, i meant uncontrolled. I apologize for the errors, im posting from my phone instead of my laptop due to the holiday.,There's a big difference between sport and real martial arts. A lot of tools you learn in traditional martial arts are not allowed in sports - things like eye poking, throat strikes, elbow/knee breaking - these are all taught in wing chun (and other non-sport martial arts).,Yet I see so many punches wildly thrown and missing the target in boxing matches. This is another advantage wing chun has - if a wing chun practitioner is facing you, you're getting punched, because it's all thrown from the center line and going directly to the target. There's no need to aim your punch.,Note, I'm not saying other styles are bad, or that wing chun is better than everything else. It all depends on the fighter at the end of the day. I'm just offering it as a suggesting to the poster who wanted a standing fighting style, as opposed to a ground-based one. Hell, I'm a wing-chun practitioner and I do 7-star mantis kung fu as well to compensate where I think my wing chun falls sort (distance fighting, quick stepping, grappling, take downs).,Thats because they aren't willing to sacrifice their positioning for a strike, instead they'll use safer strikes until an opening is either found through the strike, or simply worn through from exhaustion. I find the idea of facing my opponent squarely to be strange, at an angle it is easier to slip blows, sprawl ahainst takedowns and generate power with your hips and feet. ,There are two arguements for this. The first is that you cannot safely practice those under live conditions, because im seriously doubtful your sifu would allow you guys to poke one another's eyes out. This means that you are familiar with using the technique under ideal conditions, rather than the swirl of deadly pimpbomb-filled street combat. The second reason is that you assume that those strikes are immediately debilitating, stuff like bites, eye gouges and knees to the nuts hurt, but it is possible to foght through them, especially with the aid of adrenaline. Pain-compliance can be effective of course, but its not an instant game-winner or panacea to grappling,You seem to be under the mistaken impression that boxing is just full body, wild strikes that the boxer doesn't have control of. That is wrong. Experienced boxers use footwork and fast jabs to find the range, get into their preferred range and get the rhythm of their opponent down. They then throw committed punches when appropriate. Throwing out wild flurries of power punches right off the bat is sloppy boxing, and only works on equally sloppy opponents.,Those techniques that are too deadly for sports are overhyped. On the street, there is nothing stopping a boxer from just aiming for the throat instead of the chin. There is nothing stopping a wrestler from gouging someone in the eye or snapping a limb they have an advantageous hold on. Too many TMA die hards fall back on the ""our techniques are too deadly"" excuse to explain why their training methods don't work in competitive fighting, instead of actually addressing WHY they don't work against trained, resisting opponents.,At least I can still train with a 4 time world champ/two time no gi champ/Pan American champ coach, r-right?,There is a guy at our gym who drives 45 minutes, 3 times a week to get to us. Its just a matter of passion at the end of the day. I would graw one of my less important digits off for that opportunity though.,It's also a matter of having money to drive there or quitting my job to have the time to actually bike there and back on a regular basis.,That's cool and all, but BJJ is actually useful.,I've been practicing BJJ for 6 months consistently, 1st place in my first tournament last week.,I also practice JKD, not as often however. Let me just say...,You've pretty much just said to do what guys did in the late 90's/start of the 00's with the Lion's Den. It worked for what, 2/3 years?,Time for that simplistic thinking went a long time ago.,Yeah, JKD is weird since its more of a viewpoint/approach/thesis than something approaching a formalized art. People in the style(?) Have a massive amount of crosstraining simply as a natural result of their views. This means you could meet people who are of wildly different approaches, with utterly different sets of techniques.,most people would agree (unless they have some kind of pride on the line and refuse to admit it) wrestling is a foil to BJJ, BJJ may give you a better edge taking a striker down but a wrestler can more easily beat a jiu jitsu guy.,What? A wrestler might get the take down on a BJJ guy because wrestlers are all about take downs, but once the fight is on the floor, the BJJ guy feels right at home where he can start using submissions,the wrestler keeps mobility, they know how to work offense from the ground. Wrestlers always have an easier time than the Jiu jitsu guys when they are fighting. Not to say the wrestler will always win but the nature of wrestling moves give it an advantage,A lot of forms of wrestling cease the encounter as soon as they hit the ground. They have some of the same restrictions that judoka have in their techniques. BJJ does have substantially less techniques for takedowns, but againay art has its downsides. Thats why you study multiple things,You clearly know nothing about Jiu Jitsu,clearly you have never faces a wrestler,I have, in my last tournament. ,They're all power, no skill. ,He clearly looked like a wrestler, so I didn't let him get a takedown on me, I pulled guard, and from the ground he had no technique at all, and I triangle choked him.,well now it's obvious you have your head up your ass,your turtle on its back technique is not the end all of ground fighting, you are going to have to come to terms with that fact,Just because he's a wrestler and had shitty ground control doesn't mean that all wrestlers have shitty ground control.,I donno what gyms you go to but the two iv seen everyone is really relaxed and after almost every practice everyone hangs out on the mats and talks about their life and problems., I know what you mean but i don't think the couple of meatheads you've see or heard is really quality sample, the fighters iv met are good people its just a different type of philosophy more based in reality then ancient ideas or masters.,If you want to learn more about fighting while staying up, check out Krav Maga. Might not be for everyone, but really improved my standing fight abilities,different bjj fag, wrestlers are some of the finest positional grapplers and takedown artists ive seen,that being said i laugh as they try to submit anyone, this pissing contest will evolve into whos rules are we playing by pansy bjj sport/wrestling point counting? or submission grappling? wrestlers win the first, bjj wins the second,there i just saved you both some asspain and time,in relation to this, krav maga can be a good SUPPLEMENT to a standing art, but please for the love of god dont think you are going to stand in front of a boxer with nothing but krav maga(protip:if you do your body better be ready),Is it possible to get decent at muay thai from just watching videos online?,I don't wanna be a pro fighter, just enough to defend myself. Too aspie and poor to go to a gym at the moment.,There is absolutely no substitute for a good coach and gym.,If you want to learn how to defend yourself, you can't do so online or on your own. At best you can learn/practice basic techniques, but chances are you'll get something wrong and then ingrain bad habits.,But the biggest problem is that you don't know how to apply techniques to a situation, nor know/understand how to read an opponent, a situation nor know how your body reacts under stress or with adrenaline pumping through your system...,Ok, that makes sense.,My arm is retarded though so it's kind of embarrassing, I'll at least check out the gyms in my area.,I learned a quite fun martial art,It's called Sanda (or sanshou). Basically kick-boxing with some wing-chun principles and takedowns. ,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8nC,There is also NO substitute for sparring.,If you work muay thai, do not neglect your hands/headmovement. Work for 2-3 months, then start sparring hard once a week for 2 months. After that, spar hard once-twice a month. You don't want to spar too much, only enough so that you don't get rusty or flinchy.,Spar every day from day one, no pads. Don't be a bitch.,Muay Thai is deffinetly better for MMA. Jeet Kune Do is street defense. Bruce Lee did Jeet Kune Do that was his main martial art. Although Muay Thai can also very useful for the street.,Sparring doesn't help when you don't have a clue about what the hell you're doing,Then you better learn quick or continue to get your ass kicked.,holy fuck half the video is just praise after praise for the guy without saying anything meaningful, fuck they don't even identify which fighter is which when the video starts,From the K-1 and Lion Fights I've seen, they only break clinches if they don't throw anything. Haven't heard anything about elbows banned in Lion Fight, though K-1 they are,Not OP but i guess the title works - How long are classes/training sessions generally? I've had asthma my whole life and only now have I come to the realization that I really do have shit cardio. I'm aware that everywhere would have different routines and intensity levels differ, but I was wondering if I should try focus on cardio alone so I can last a class before I pass out and/or vomit,I would suggest JKD, as it also has many Muay Thai techniques as well as trapping which helps clear your opponents gaurd.,People throw up a lot, especially newbies to grappling. It's very, very strenuous if you've never experienced it before, due to what is known as noob spazzing. You'll basically freak out and try to use all your strength to throw people off of you, etc. I would say do some conditioning on your own and find a gym anyway. Most places won't get offended if you stop early, especially if you're new.,JKD isn't a martial style in the truest sense, and varies wildly from practitioner to practitioner due to the personal, individual approach that it takes. Certain versions of it certainly contain Muay Thai, but it isn't nearly the same thing.,OP, have you considered Aikido? Assuming you've got access to a decent club, it sounds like it'd be right up your alley. Though there are some weapons (""aikido bats"", as our sensei would call them while MCing a demo), and quite a bit of suwariwaza (techniques done from sitting on your knees and feet), most aikido practice happens standing up and resembles wrestling in that there's grabs and such going on.,Seeing as you've already got an idea of how to punch and kick, you'd have a (tiny bit of) leg up.,Very little throwing up in aikido, too. No cup, no tooth guard, no adversarial practice or competition. Highest proportion of women in a martial art (i.e. not counting things like self-defense classes). Once you've got safe falling down you can start training more dynamically, which looks super badass on Youtube.,He says he wants to compete, so a martial art that has been stripped of its martial ability through watered down training isn't the best bet. Training should be hard dude, if you aren't conditioned then how the hell are you going to pull off this stuff against resisting opponents? Even Osensei was like in crazy good shape.,Eh, true, there's no competition in Aikido. Missed that bit.,Dunno really, I've found that the curret form of aikido training permits levels of strength that'd be dangerous with things like kicks and locks on the spine, as done in a fair many other MAs. Admittedly it looks fake as fuck, and when I was practicing with someone of my own (n00bly, 4. kyu) level it also felt fake as fuck, but then trying to not cooperate with a 2. dan I realized that it's totally not fake. (Also the wrist locks, arm turns, and especially the elbow locks genuinely hurt. They're not difficult to do either, practically a staple of all ju-jitsu.),Anyway, the way to pull off aikido against resisting opponents is to use more strength, or ideally, better timing. Or if the opponent doesn't know what's good for him/her, punches to the face: there's a lot of implied fisting involved. Some substyles make a point of showing every punch, but more traditional mainstream Aikido seemed to deprecate punches almost to the point of non-involvement.,I can definitely see Aikido not being for everyone. There's little room for huffing and puffing and punching a sack to become tougher and harder.,There are no shortcuts, the huffing and puffing is needed. ,It doesn't teach you to do it on a resisting opponent...,Stand-up grappling is about positioning and weight distribution, the throws in Aikido come primarily from the hips, you shouldn't need strength. The reason you use it is because youre used to do the techniques under ideal conditions, not when someone is flailing around and fucling you up. Its what happens when you don't train live.,Haha, yes. But in all seriousness, you can't just imply strikes, you have to drill them until they become reflex or otherwise you won't react in time.,Aikido has some up-shots, it teaches you how to feel your opponents intent and weight distribution through touch, it also has fantastoc training for breakfalls and rolls. Its unfortunate, it started off pretty cool in the '50s.",Choosing a Martial Art thread,"03/30/13(Sat)21:21,03/30/13(Sat)21:27,03/30/13(Sat)21:30,03/30/13(Sat)21:31,03/30/13(Sat)21:51,03/30/13(Sat)22:04,03/30/13(Sat)22:22,03/30/13(Sat)22:26,03/30/13(Sat)22:28,03/30/13(Sat)22:36,03/30/13(Sat)22:39,03/30/13(Sat)22:45,03/30/13(Sat)22:50,03/30/13(Sat)22:53,03/30/13(Sat)22:57,03/30/13(Sat)22:59,03/30/13(Sat)23:04,03/30/13(Sat)23:55,03/31/13(Sun)00:40,03/31/13(Sun)00:43,03/31/13(Sun)00:43,03/31/13(Sun)01:31,03/31/13(Sun)02:35,03/31/13(Sun)02:36,03/31/13(Sun)03:11,03/31/13(Sun)03:33,03/31/13(Sun)03:36,03/31/13(Sun)03:38,03/31/13(Sun)03:58,03/31/13(Sun)04:05,03/31/13(Sun)04:15,03/31/13(Sun)04:25,03/31/13(Sun)04:28,03/31/13(Sun)04:31,03/31/13(Sun)04:33,03/31/13(Sun)04:37,03/31/13(Sun)04:40,03/31/13(Sun)12:24,03/31/13(Sun)12:28,03/31/13(Sun)12:41,03/31/13(Sun)12:41,03/31/13(Sun)14:40,03/31/13(Sun)15:14,03/31/13(Sun)16:13,03/31/13(Sun)16:33,03/31/13(Sun)16:36,03/31/13(Sun)16:40,03/31/13(Sun)16:42,03/31/13(Sun)16:43,03/31/13(Sun)16:50,03/31/13(Sun)16:51,03/31/13(Sun)16:52,03/31/13(Sun)16:52,03/31/13(Sun)16:57,03/31/13(Sun)17:18,03/31/13(Sun)17:40,03/31/13(Sun)17:40,03/31/13(Sun)18:20,03/31/13(Sun)18:24,03/31/13(Sun)18:26,03/31/13(Sun)18:30,03/31/13(Sun)18:32,03/31/13(Sun)18:47,03/31/13(Sun)18:49,03/31/13(Sun)18:55,03/31/13(Sun)18:58,03/31/13(Sun)19:04,03/31/13(Sun)19:06,03/31/13(Sun)19:19,03/31/13(Sun)19:22,03/31/13(Sun)19:28,03/31/13(Sun)19:29,03/31/13(Sun)19:36,03/31/13(Sun)21:06,03/31/13(Sun)22:36,03/31/13(Sun)23:05,03/31/13(Sun)23:10,03/31/13(Sun)23:25,03/31/13(Sun)23:28,03/31/13(Sun)23:29,03/31/13(Sun)23:36,03/31/13(Sun)23:58,04/01/13(Mon)01:28,04/01/13(Mon)01:43,04/01/13(Mon)01:45,04/01/13(Mon)01:55,04/01/13(Mon)02:00,04/01/13(Mon)03:41,04/01/13(Mon)04:16,04/01/13(Mon)07:52,04/01/13(Mon)09:28,04/01/13(Mon)13:41,04/01/13(Mon)13:43,04/01/13(Mon)15:41,04/01/13(Mon)16:11,04/01/13(Mon)16:45,04/01/13(Mon)16:58","Anonymous,Choosing a Martial Art thread,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,MOFO OP,MOFO OP,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment]"
"wat do? Skate talk I guess, sorry if there already is one but I didn't go past the front page,Natural ntroverts skate the best. No distractions.,I feel you. I'm in pretty much the same position as you probably are. In our skatepark there is always just one other guy that is pretty good (was sponsered by fallen before he had a car accident and his brother got killed in it). Now he's sponsered by a skateshop in the next town because we live in a shithole. Well I have a couple of friends that used to skate for a bit, but now I am the only one that's still into it. I'm not that good but that doesn't bother me since I have fun doing it. I just wish we had decent street spots or a nice park.,I skated constantly growing up and I'm just getting back in touch with it at 25. I'm not great but I'm already making faster progress than I used to, better resources online and after spending time messing around with flatland bmx, aggressive inline, bboying and even scooters for a hot bored minute I have a much better perspective on how to approach and practice new tricks.

Everything related to BMX goes ITT,BMX General thread,04/01/13(Mon)17:47,"Ananomouse,BMX General thread,Ananomouse"
"Any kendokas here?,Hey. Seems like there isn't much love for us here. 1st kyu from a club in China. On the topic of your picture; tsuki is a fucking bitch.,There's already a kendo thread ,Op here. That thread 404'red. ,I think tsuki a strike just like men kote or do. If you know how to do it safely its not that bad.,Would a kendoka win against a fencer?,Deppends on the kendoka and the fencer,I would say kendoka would win because we practise strikes to the hands as well as the body.,there are few funny videos on youtube:,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ST1,how often do you check your shinai? We check before practise and during practise few times.,Try fencing for a few months, and I think you'll realize that a skilled fencer has enough accuracy with their blade to target the small gaps or weak places in a suit of armor.,Also, fencers who use an epee will target the entire body: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epee . More to the point, the hand, wrist, and forearm are probably the most commonly attacked targets in an epee match.,I agree that it probably just comes down to the individuals dueling, though. I would actually give the advantage to a fencer using a rapier, due to the blade being considerably longer than a katana.,All the same: go kendo! Go fencing! Sword sports are the best!,What are the scoring areas in kendo? From what I can figure, it's the whole head, tops of shoulders, forearms, and sides of the torso but not the center. Do you have to score with slashes/swings, or do stabs count too?,And if you go 2-sword style, can the shorter sword also score points?,There's a tennis ball hanging from a string at the club I go to. Some people practice hitting it like a reflex bag. It's pretty impressive when a good fencer gets at it. If there's a gap in the armor, a good fencer could get it.,When the Portuguese landed in Japan, they're are some records of things getting pissy between them and the Samurai.,A couple of cases wound up with a samurai full of rapier holes, and a Portuguese missing his head.,I've been watching some kendo videos on the 'tubes. What happens in that clench? Can you score points from the clench, or is it just free time to talk shit, catch your breath, and shove your opponent around? I can't hear it in the audio, do the refs break the clench?,Also, I see a lot of strikes that look like they should score. Are they not scoring because of some right-of-way issue, or because the judge doesn't consider it to have been in good form?,Scoring areas are following,Men - The top of the head,Kote - The hands,Do - the middle of torso,Tsuki - throath,Just hitting these spots is not enough - the strike must be done correctly and with right set of spirit (yeah the scoring is not so well defined). , ,Well said! ,Thats a awsome idea! I need to try to practise with that at home. (ill continue in the next message - i need a picture...),Nah, those are just internet rumors with 0 documentation.,(continueing),We practise hitting with a forward strike the wooden parts of these things in the picture (sorry i dont know their name in english).,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXMf,http://youtu.be/X2Ml8km62dk,Are there any resources in english about nito ryu kendo?,This thread needs more wrestling.,There we go.,Oi, no cosplay allowed.,Also take off the trip.,what exactly happend on the picture?,i like this,I do believe that kendoka just got shanked.,If the kendoka is using a samurai armor, the kendoka, no contest, a dueling sword would never penetrate a heavy armor if not, the fencer, fuckers are fast. It also depends of the idividual skills obviously.,she made me smile ^_^,Kendoka reporting in from LI. Just got back from the Shoryuhai tournament at Harvard.,Kendoka are also really fast. It really depends only on skill, obviously there's no armor to take into consideration.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teMd,I think one of them would be in advantage, I just can't figure out who would be. Kendo isn't as fast as fencing, and with something as havy as a katana they would be even slower, it wouldn't be dificult to a good fencer to stab the kendoka halfway through his strike. But a good part of fencing (epee at least) consist in hitting the enemy's sword out of your way to strike him, that just wouldn't be possible with someone holding a sword with both hands, and the kaatana superior mass would make it easy to cut of bend the sword's blade...,Thinking about it is driving me nuts,Kendoka at higher ranks are STUPID fast. I don't think the fencer has a solid chance against a well trained Kendoka.,You are thinking wrong, it's just a matter of individual skills, and fencing is faster than kendo, the weapon is much lighter and the movement consist im just straighting your arm,Fencing takes more talent and skill. Kendo is just weabo nerd shit,I think we'd have to watch the match in order to gauge it properly because I don't think us doing theory will do any good. It's like that show the Ultimate Warrior but without any cool demonstration of weapons.,I say we agree to disagree and move on. That being said I can answer any kendo questions for any kendoka and non kendoka,As someone who has been doing both fencing and kendo for decent amounts of time (albeit fencing longer), honestly, it's hard to say. A well trained kendoka has a lot more force behind one of his strikes than a fencer does, so if he hits, its pretty much game over; that said, a fencer is more likely to hit first, especially as in kendo, the sword does not move first (one reason why kendo is suicidal when used in actual combat). If the fencer manages to make the one strike they'll get in count, they might win; that said, stabbing someone rarely stops them from striking immediately, so it's more likely that they'll end up dying anyways, especially as the kendoka will be tossing their whole weight forward into the strike and following through.,Any kendoka here have experience with Jodan? I want to try it once my basics are solid.,Troll,This is why kendoka and fencers are both shitty martial artists.,They both think in straight lines.,I would like to get into Kendo, but the nearest place to learn is 3 hours away in Hotlanta. Even then, I'd imagine taking classes there would be extremely expensive. ,Also, how comparable is Kendo to Aikido? To my understanding, the latter was based on the former. If you were a Kendoka, would you be able to practically merge right into Aikido? And does it work in reverse? I'd imagine the training for torquing would work better for Aikido to Kendo than the other way around.,I'm sorry, but my bias leans towards Kendo.,Goosebumps.,Cool picture, Anon.,You're funny. I like you.,Adorable.,omg is he ok?,They're sports.,I suppose thats true. Now, if you asked me who would win between a kenjutsuka and a fencer, my money would be on the kenjutsuka hands down.,Kendofag from Bulgaria here. 1st kiu. anyone still in this thread?,Fencers never really claim to be martial artists, just athletes.,1kyu from UK, I might dump some more pictures later.,Yeah, but I'm just lurking. Can't say much about Kendo, I'm doing BattoJutsu myself.,1st dan of kendo and judo reporting in,1st dan from USA. TFW 1st dan when I was 18... then went to college and stopped now for over 6 years :(,the noobs i taught/instructed are now 2-3rd dan,Shodan in Kendo and Naginata, eighth Geup in Kumdo here. ,Question: Anyone ever try the carbon-fiber shinai? How is the response/whipyness etc?,I've tried a carbon one. It seems a bit heavier and looks not as good as the bamboo one. Also if you're hit it hurts more, trust me ALOT more. I guess these are the main reasons people prefer bamboo ones,anyone spar using two swords? one shinai and a shorter one of the other hand.. ive sparred with people using two before but it seems to me like its much harder to compete and requires more strengths,also 3rd kyu in iaido if that counts,Man I would love to try my hand at Naginata. Share some experiences? How does it differ from Kendo?,It depends. Vs. Naginata, its quick, and very subtle, with a surgical strike ending the fight. Vs. Kendo, it becomes either an all out assault to counter the aggression of the Kendoka, or a very defensive game hoping to find a gap in the flurry of blows. If the Kendoka gets into your B range, you need to start backpeddling like a mother fucker.,The Big difference is that suneate must be worn, as the shin and knee are prime targets for the Naginatadoka. This really fucks up a Kendoka's game if they are not familiar fighting against it.,I also tend to prefer using my naginata kote for both kendo/kumdo and naginata, as they are thicker, and have a separated fore finger for better control.,I have. Two weapon, weapon and open hand, and (very rarely) weapon and wicker shield happen in Kumdo. I tend to use some of the tricks and techniques from Italian fiore with rapier and dagger/cased rapier and get away with it :P,Meant to link to ,I didnt know about shoto and wicker shield. Is that a kumdo thing only?,Yes. Kumdo is basically Korean kendo. The technology of China and Japan met and dispersed at Korea, and the majority of later-period swords known as Gau or Yedo are basically katanas with a heavier pommel weight and a lanyard half way down the handle. It could be used as one handed (hence the lanyard and heavier pommel) or two handed much like a katana.,Many Josun-era and later swords, both single and two handed looked like variously sized katanas, only with heavy pommels. ,Shield is a dying and unpopular art. Single, two handed and paired are more popular, as you can inter compete with Kendo typically.|,Damn shame :(,FUN FACT: Many of the best Japanese swords used Korean iron or flat out used imported Korean blades, which is ironic considering that most historians introduced that style of blade to Korea, who before where using Jian or Dao shaped blades, or the native hwandudaedo (see pic),yup only 2 years of practice though,yeah that's about right depending on how intense the practice is. One of our seniors snapped his in half during a drill because he wasn't really checking it that much.,Sounds interesting. Would you be able to recommend anything worth reading to learn more?,I know that kumdo is korean kendo. Part of my universities kumdo team ontop of private kendo study. Didnt know about the shield though. Id like to give it a go.,I'll ask my dad next time we talk. Personally, I have no idea.,Its an oval or round rattan shield, and almost no one but the third Geup and up even bother with them anymore. Now aday's Kumdo is just Kendo with the bogu and shinai being called different names.,Damn shame.,Black belt in gumdo here (same things as kumdo),gumdo is more focused on patterns and drills as opposed to kendo which i believe is 100% sparring.,our gumdo club is only 3 people big, and is primarily focused on sparring though. Latley we've been fighting with western medieval weapons like spears and rapiers. and have been practicing German longsword techniques. this is probably because our instructor was involved in the SCA before he got into gumdo.,Where are you approximately located, if you don't mind me asking?,iaido 1dan (AJKF), kenjutsu 2dan here. I always wanted to get into kendo but don't really have the time or money now. Still paying off my sword for cutting lol.,You dont need to buy the kendo bogu (armor) at beginning. You can easily train till 3rd kyu without the armor.,Do you know the name of the shield? I would like to see some vids of it's use.,Bangpae.,I sparred against Mathew Raymond from Canada a couple of times. Once you realise how to get close enough to strike without getting smashed in the head it gets a bit easier... until then, you're going to have a headache.,I phrased that incorrectly.,""I had the privilege of sparring with Matthew Raymond"" is more apt,I can't seem to find anything on this.,Like I said, its pretty damn dead. Originally, Kumdo also did bo training too.,Most unfortunate.,bump on this thread,i have used a Hasegawa for some time. Sadly that was like 2 years ago and i pretty much forgot how it was but i remeber it was a little more heavier than the bamboo shinnai, they sure are strong. This shinnai i talk about lasted like... 6 years at least i belive (yes, it lasted a really long time) and i know this because it was sensei´s shinnai so they are pretty good as far as i know,where on long island? do you practice at the school in farmingville?,That clench is like a ""dead point"" ,when you attack you get close to the opponent so he/she cant hit you or counter attack you. There are some ways to attack from that position (men tai atari men or men tai atari hiki men) you can either push the opponent or step backwards to attack. When both kendokas dont take their distance or attack (just satanding there) yes, the ""referee"" can break that and start from the starting position. For a valid point there must be ki, ken, tai as well as kigurai, meaning you must hit the oponent in the right way and posture (standing straight, keep your arms streched, hitting the opponent at the same time that you do your kiai and fumi komi),am i missing something? you guys have baloons on your men? you where going for a... i dont know how to say it a ""one hit kill"" (or in this case one hit pop) practice? Not making fun of you im really asking this becasue i have seen in it in a video,Sweet jesus fuck. Would you say its worth the money?,This is usually done as either a fun exercise or more commonly done as part of an exhibition or demo. I've done this with a dojo as part of a fund raiser for a breast cancer charity, along with using pool-noodle boffers and letting the kids beat up on us.,Yes captcha, it impractical whenever, but its fun and goofy.,Yeah, I would say its worth it. Actually i was the one who broked it... it was back in the day when i started using the bogu, i wasnt cutting i was wacking hahaha, so yeah, after a lot of abuse one of the sticks broke but the rest of the sticks are fine, if i buy one extra stick for that shinnai it can go back in action, you should give it a try.,This is something that we havent figured out yet. How can we do the exhibitions more attractive to the public? We tried with Iaido, we traied with kendo using bogu, but it seems that we always miss something. Any suggestions?,Did kumdo for about a year. It was extremely hard to progress in rank and then the dojo closed. I once sparred against a guy w/ 15 years of both kendo and fencing. I was in much pain.,Well, I also do educational demos for a non-profit medieval organization. I'd suggest a few things:,*Watching is great, but you can watch shit online. Get them involved. Let them try on bogu. Teach them the basic Men strike, and let them try it out on a willing student. NEVER strike back, but let them ""get in the moment,*If possible, bring the proper analogues, such as an iado sword (obviously not to be handled by the public) and a boken to compare to a shinai. Even better would be if you could get a hold of someone with period correct Japanese armor to compare the bogu to. ,*Make a spiel, and have someone who can speak well present it. Have it done during the first few bouts, with the kendoka flowing evenly with the presenter.,things to cover:,-Who you are as a group,-What you are doing,-Why you are doing it/the history,-basic FAQ or ""why is he screaming the same words over and over?"",If possible, make a flyer or a pamphlet with your dojo info, a shortened version of the spiel (Who, what, why) and contact info.,Im probably missing much, but I am quite drunk at this time., Yes, a lack of dojo could be a very big hindrance.,Hahaha! hey, a good kendoka must like beer huh? Pretty much all my senpai and sensei like alcohol- Thanks a lot for the tips i will talk about it with sensei and the senpai. Cheers,did he dead?,Obviously not op, but no, hes fine, the shinnai got stucked in his men. You should see a tamago tsuki... that thing hurts like hell...lol!,Sorry if this post was from a while back, or has already been addressed... I just found this board/thread.,I went from Aikido to Kendo. I think it probably depends a great deal on where/with whom you trained Aikido. Like any instance of crosstraining or switching from one sport/martial art to another, I had some ""bad habits"" that came with me, and some things that crossed over quite well. Most of what translated well had to do with tenouchi (grip on the shinai,) and maintaining a relaxed, loose, flexible body posture while staying in very exact positions (kamae). Also the ability to learn kata quickly and precisely, and the understanding of body mechanics that came from Aikido were helpful.,The footwork is very different, as is the mindset, though many ""aiki"" principles are very applicable to jigeiko (sparring) in their abstract form. Any notions you may have though about aikido sword stuff giving you any kind of advantage in learning Kendo should be thrown out. To put it bluntly, I would say that 99% of aikido weapons training is pure ridiculous bullshit. Any aikidoka trying any of that silly mutodori sword-taking stuff against even a relatively unskilled first year kendoka would find himself sliced to ribbons, (or more likely covered in bruises and welts...),http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMbT,Im more of a liquor kinda guy.,Dead as good friday, obviously. Don't you know? There is no ""second place"" in kendo!,Boston area kendo fan here. Trained for about 2 years near here, but have been out of practice for a long while now. I miss it terribly. I mostly stopped due to college and work and lack of a car, which made for long trips on public transit and walking with equipment. ,I would very much like to return to training, and was very sad to learn that my sensei recently moved back to Japan.,Never tested for rank, though I probably could/should have. It never really seemed important to me at the time though, I was having too much fun finally being able to wear bogu and participate in jigeiko and shiai... I saw some definite improvement over the course of my practice, but mostly everyone still seemed to be worlds better than me.,In the US true, but Japan likes to skip most of the kyu system. With iaido I went straight from zip to 1kyu and then 1dan a couple months later. I have kendo friends who would probably lend me their extra gear, so it's more the time than anything else.,In the UK at least it's usually done on the last session before taking a break for christmas, 5-10 a side, side that pops all the balloons of the opposite team wins. Fun as hell.,I've heard that carbon shinai can be hell for your joints, since they don't absorb vibrations like bamboo does. Any truth to that?,20 y/o, Europe, been practicing for 6-7 years. About ten medals total in national and international junior competitions (most of the national ones are meh, level of junior competition at the time was pretty shit, me included). I'm hoping I can get good enough to join the national men's team in time for next world championship.,Also, I should put my ass in gear and get my 2nd dan. I stopped caring about my rank like three years ago when I got 1st dan.,Maaaaaaaaaaaaybe,personally i didnt had any trouble... unless you count that my wrists crunch some times but i think thats result of the kote´s i recived thought the years. I havent experienced any pain or anything. So i dont know, maybe its just a myth,anyone here visiting the european championship in berlin?,Why do you ask? Come back ;-;,ROBOT,KENDO,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGzH,Sent this shit to my Senpai. I was impressed.,Noice.,I have one - its hell on your joint on long run. Also it hurts your opponents more. I dont use it anymore.,any of you kendokas ever had the opportunity to use kendo in a street fight ?,u wot m8?,That's like asking if anyone has used golf or bowling in a street fight.",,"03/23/13(Sat)10:49,03/23/13(Sat)13:34,03/23/13(Sat)15:39,03/24/13(Sun)03:07,03/24/13(Sun)03:16,03/24/13(Sun)03:39,03/24/13(Sun)03:44,03/24/13(Sun)04:08,03/24/13(Sun)04:15,03/24/13(Sun)05:37,03/24/13(Sun)11:59,03/24/13(Sun)12:13,03/24/13(Sun)12:16,03/24/13(Sun)12:16,03/24/13(Sun)12:26,03/24/13(Sun)12:29,03/24/13(Sun)12:32,03/24/13(Sun)12:58,03/24/13(Sun)13:09,03/24/13(Sun)13:46,03/24/13(Sun)14:38,03/24/13(Sun)14:39,03/24/13(Sun)14:42,03/24/13(Sun)16:02,03/24/13(Sun)16:14,03/24/13(Sun)16:20,03/24/13(Sun)16:24,03/24/13(Sun)22:10,03/24/13(Sun)22:31,03/24/13(Sun)22:42,03/24/13(Sun)23:15,03/24/13(Sun)23:25,03/24/13(Sun)23:34,03/24/13(Sun)23:36,03/24/13(Sun)23:37,03/24/13(Sun)23:46,03/25/13(Mon)00:35,03/25/13(Mon)00:41,03/25/13(Mon)01:27,03/25/13(Mon)01:49,03/25/13(Mon)02:13,03/25/13(Mon)06:30,03/25/13(Mon)06:36,03/25/13(Mon)06:40,03/25/13(Mon)06:50,03/25/13(Mon)07:08,03/25/13(Mon)07:09,03/25/13(Mon)08:36,03/25/13(Mon)12:16,03/25/13(Mon)12:53,03/25/13(Mon)13:04,03/25/13(Mon)13:20,03/25/13(Mon)14:25,03/25/13(Mon)15:03,03/25/13(Mon)15:36,03/25/13(Mon)15:51,03/25/13(Mon)18:35,03/25/13(Mon)19:12,03/25/13(Mon)19:18,03/25/13(Mon)22:11,03/25/13(Mon)23:40,03/25/13(Mon)23:41,03/26/13(Tue)11:49,03/26/13(Tue)19:01,03/26/13(Tue)19:09,03/26/13(Tue)19:42,03/26/13(Tue)19:59,03/27/13(Wed)02:08,03/27/13(Wed)02:37,03/27/13(Wed)02:45,03/27/13(Wed)03:47,03/27/13(Wed)04:34,03/27/13(Wed)11:06,03/27/13(Wed)17:38,03/27/13(Wed)19:12,03/27/13(Wed)21:20,03/27/13(Wed)21:29,03/28/13(Thu)00:06,03/28/13(Thu)00:43,03/28/13(Thu)01:01,03/28/13(Thu)21:25,03/28/13(Thu)21:54,03/28/13(Thu)21:57,03/28/13(Thu)22:12,03/28/13(Thu)22:20,03/28/13(Thu)23:31,03/28/13(Thu)23:45,03/29/13(Fri)00:16,03/29/13(Fri)01:57,03/29/13(Fri)02:01,03/29/13(Fri)02:13,03/29/13(Fri)02:18,03/29/13(Fri)02:31,03/29/13(Fri)02:36,03/29/13(Fri)02:41,03/29/13(Fri)02:53,03/29/13(Fri)07:52,03/29/13(Fri)09:47,03/29/13(Fri)09:58,03/29/13(Fri)11:07,03/30/13(Sat)04:00,03/30/13(Sat)04:23,03/30/13(Sat)09:10,03/31/13(Sun)01:44,03/31/13(Sun)02:53,03/31/13(Sun)03:00,03/31/13(Sun)03:03,03/31/13(Sun)03:04,04/01/13(Mon)15:12,04/01/13(Mon)17:49","Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,The

"I'm 22 and I wanna start rollerskating, Is it too late?,Also, is it too late for skateboarding too?,I wouldn't imagine so, as long as you have the motivation and a pair of skates.,I'm 19 and I'm probably ordering my first pair tomorrow or Tuesday.,Any advice on skate choosing?,I'm just starting out, but what I've gathered from the general Agressive Skate thread was to start with either Flats, which are skates with 4 wheels and the small gap in the middle. Flats are good for learning how to maneuver skates and form proper ""technique"" when grinding.,The other starter choice, if you already know how to skate, would be Anti-Rockers. Which have 4 wheels. 1 in front and 1 in back, and the two inside wheels are small and hard, so they help you balance while grinding, but give you more grind room than flats. At least, that's what I've gathered. ,These are what I'm getting, and a couple people said they were an okay choice. They're anti-rocker.,One thing, the skates arent flat, the frames are, you can make any skate flat or antirocker,I fruitbooted for years when I was younger, and quit for really no reason at all. I still regret it. I'd highly recommend going for an anti-rocker setup, as they let you branch into many more technical grinds than the four full-sized wheel setup. ,The way rollerblading works, there aren't quite as many established tricks as skateboarding, so really, go and give it a shot. Rollerblading isn't defined as much by a repertoire as skateboarding is, so go out, develop your own style, have a fuckton of fun, and don't let anyone get you down about wearing those clunky motherfuckers. Skateboarders will just be jelly as fuck because you actually land most tricks you attempt, rather than one in every ten tries.,Yeah, yeah that's what I meant, wasn't really paying attention. Soz.,Yep, I know for sure that once I get my skates I will literally be considered one of the ""gayest motherfuckers around"", because all we have here are hillbillies (literally) and middleschool sk8r b0iz. Don't care though, looks like a hell of a lot of fun. Thing I find most appealing about it is how you can just cruise down the street, see some kind of ledge, curb, bench, hell anything that's flat and 90degrees and grind it, jump it, you name it. Cannot wait for those skates at all.,If you care about image probably too late for rollerskating. Might not be for skateboard if you progress quick enough.,If you don't give a fuck then go for it.,Could you be any more of a faggot,Is that comic sans? LOL,My entire Chrome browser is in Comic Sans. It's absolutely fantastic. ,It's an extension called ""COMIC SANS EVERYWHERE"",You're not to old, don't worry about what losers think. As long as you're having fun you're good, try to find someone to skate with if possible.,Like someone already said, the appeal of inline for me was the relative ease of the tricks (not that there aren't terrifying difficult tricks to be done). It's so much easier to put on some music and roll down the street and flow on shit you see, lots of fun.,My very first setup was anti but I'll never skate anything but freestyle again. Xsjados too for that matter, just love the amount of freedom freestyle frames and those huge baseplates give you in a street session.,I really just want to know WHAT exactly people find so ""gay"" about it? I mean, I can understand if you're an uneducated fool who doesn't know the difference between recreational and aggressive. But to people who do, then what is it?",,"03/31/13(Sun)23:41,03/31/13(Sun)23:46,03/31/13(Sun)23:47,04/01/13(Mon)00:08,04/01/13(Mon)00:20,04/01/13(Mon)00:23,04/01/13(Mon)00:39,04/01/13(Mon)08:14,04/01/13(Mon)09:34,04/01/13(Mon)10:21,04/01/13(Mon)12:29,04/01/13(Mon)17:34,04/01/13(Mon)18:20","Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"
"post your bikes,also, why do/don't you run pegs/brakes?,and what do you think of adam22,I run pegs because I like to grind. I just put brakes back on after about 6 years of not having them because I just want to do something new and I like being able to stop now that I'm older. ,And as far as adam goes, I guess he's alright. I've never met him and he seems like he has matured since he first started the come up. The Come up is probably my favorite bmx site but I just wish he would post some new comeuptv sections. The video he has coming out looks nice but the trailer could have been better. The forums have been dead for a while but when that shit was at its peak it was the best.,how is this the only bmx thread wtf is wrong with this board,frankensteined flatland,wow i thought this would get more posts than this... anyone watch simple session last weekend?,yeah its sad that there are more scoot kids than bmxers here. It seems as though there is no discussion even in the few bmx threads that were around. I watched some clips and edits of simple session and thought that it was the best legit comp I've seen in a while. Have you ever attended anything like a jam or big event before? I really wish I could have seen simple in person but there is always next year and the Texas Toast jams always look like fun plus all the Fbm get togethers. I need to attend more shit, I haven't been to anything in a long while.,newest picture of her,she's sexy,Looks like a nice bike but that looks more like an impressionist painting than a photo,im from the UK and all the good jams n stuff tend to be up in either liverpool or bristol.ill probably go to the next dub jam in bristol but ill miss the up and coming one in liverpool. one day i am definitely going to texas toast.,bumping,Finally a BMX thread, I run pegs no brakes, pretty new to it though. came into it from not being able to do as much dh as i wanted. only just learning to feeble and double down things, all about the fear boundry man.,I ceeb to go take a pic of my bmx so here is my dh bike instead,Left side pegs, no brakes because they are for girls. I do ride a freecoaster though say watcha want,try harder,nice tie,but can you take a better pic of your stem,Just got the tires today :),FACK IM DUMB,pic,Ask and you shall receive.,Do you have a kickstand too, by any chance?,wow it looks really nice from what I can see. Have you made anything else?,I made a spacer once, but I don't really like to count that. I'm thinking about designing a sprocket too. Not sure if I'll make that though cause I'd need to pay a machine shop to make it on a CNC machine, which is fairly expensive.,any plans on getting into the bmx business? Or just hobby work,I miss the glory days of TCU s message board,nigga I am just using this to bike around while I wait for bootcamp,I dont do fancy tricks,Fuck off, you have a devinci ?? that must be one hell of a ride you're having.. looking good mate.. i got a fucking stinky.. don't have the money to buy another..,That high seat. Disgusting. Slam that down immediately.,holy fuck your stupid. its for flatland,So how hard is it to get into BMXing. What would you recommend starting with?,its not that hard to get into. I would just recommend manuals and bunnyhops then learn feebles, x-ups, 180's, airing quarters. Just experiment and it will come to you. Do you have a bike?,I have a mountain bike. But I wouldn't mind investing in a BMX and trying out something different.,lmao do you even flatland,do some research and find out why there are short and long seat posts.,then kill yourself.,cunt,so what do you ride most and have you been out lately? I mainly ride street but there are too many nice parks around to not go. I also haven't been getting out as much as I would like but hope to get out this weekend if my time allows, I need to try to get back a few tricks I think I may have lost,I ride flatland but haven't been out in like 2 years sadly. I was thinking about picking up a new bike this summer, DK Opsis or something cheap. ,My bike is the one posted near the top of the thread, and is a mishmash of parts thrown together out of a lack of money years ago:,KHE Messerschmitt frame,Gary Fisher Rig fork/clamp/bars/seat/crank/front brake,DK Signal sprocket,Hoffman front rim,some old ass freecoaster in the back,the rear pegs are different from that picture, I forget what brand they are but they're smaller and have griptape,The bike has served me well enough for learning and all that, but it has issues. It's a bit heavy, the cranks are way too long for the frame, and there's a ton of offset and sweep going on up front that I don't want.,im in the sfbay and theres like a jam or event going on maybe once a month and during the summer theres shit going on every weekened... oh yeah, ramp jam at scotties in san jose this saturday. he just put up his new halfpipe and has a ton of tech shit in the front yard,My baby, a Stolen Wrap 2012. Got it on sale for £140, stupidly cheap for what it is.,Gotta love clearance sales because they were bring out the 2013 models.,I've only been riding 3 months. Hence the really cheap stock bike. I can barely footjam, I don't need to spend £500+ on a full custom build.,Sorry for the bad picture. Lighting obviously wasn't on my side.,don't worry stolen stock ain't bad for beginners bro,my bike is sunday frame, odyssey parts with stolen seat and cranks but i ride for 4 years,where do I buy a cheap bmx bike?,i am american living in Nj,I want one but i am not sure if they expensive,Adam Grandmaison is a true faggot in every sense of the word. And fuck the comeup.,OG S&M Stricker,forgot the picture,Fuck me, haven't ridden this thing in years.,I feel terrible.,sometimes when i need to sneeze, ill just do it in my cats face.,also when he yawning i used to stick my finger sideways in his mouth so he couldnt close.,i used to punch my sisters in the armpits when they yawned. ,im annoying,fit series3 aiken. only pic i have.. ,shits dusty from me not riding it,I put my finger in my cat's mouth when it yawns too. It just bites down, then backs away.,I quit skating to start biking and building dirt jumps in the fields behind my nieghborhood. Biking was so much more practical because if we wanted to go to a spot Biking took 10 min compared to a 45 min trip on skateboards. ,it got too damn expensive though, I couldn't afford to keep replacing parts everytime I fucked something up. Had to retire the bike to keep snowboarding in the winter:,Stem was machined by me, sold the bike and eventually the stem broke. Haven't ridden in 3/4 of a decade.,the shoes i was wearing were Wizmerski's (spelling?) , remember that guy, brian wizmerski?,Remember when the only light forks you could get were Odyssey race forks? They didn't even come with a warranty because street riders would buy them and snap them. 2.3 pounds they were, and Black was always sold out, so I had to get the gay white and spraypaint them.,Primo Hula Hoop rim, bars off my first bike - a Dirt King,check out how tiny bars used to be - large bars were barely starting to become popular, who invented that anyways?,I don't remember if my headset was sealed or unsealed, but everytime I opened things up, the bearings were shattered to dust - though if you put things back together they would sorta keep working (lol).,skinny jeans were barely becomming a trend back then, i was 'cutting edge' in a way ...,back then fat fuck G. French (from G-sport)'s career was just a twinkle in his fat eye; he was trying to convince people to manufacture his shitty products on bikeguide.org while talking shit about mine because he was a mechanical engineer (a pretty shitty one at that if you're in your 30s making bike parts with an engineering degree). I went on to an engineering program myself though, worked in bioinformatics for a while.,Yeah wiz was the man but now I don't see much of him anymore.,My guess its 2005-06,Up until a few months ago I was still running bars that started out at 25 inches then I cut em 2 inches on each side. The looks that people would give me were hilarious but now that I have a pair of uncut scerbo's everything feels a lot more responsive but they still seem small compared to what some people are riding these days,yje only frankensteined thing i notice is the fork, cranks and matbe pegs,only got a street b,I'm not trying to start shit I genuinely want to know why ride street with that like Pros and Cons?,Man... my BMX years were the best of my life. Had so much fun waking up and spending the day going on journeys to spots with the homies. Took a really nasty fall one day, cracked my skull. Had to quit because I cant even jump anymore without getting terrible sharp head pain.,This is my ""Forgotten Misguided"" its about 5 years old. I run one peg on the rear left side to do peg manuals and grinds. I stopped running brakes because they kept rubbing and its to much effort to adjust them. Also tuck no handers are easier to catch without the brake leaver.,i know what you're yappin' about, my wrist was damaged several times, i have to do bunnyhop right or else i'll end up few days not riding at all,Damn... This thread brings back memories. I used to ride SO much a few years ago, then my bike got stolen. Haven't rode since then. I've been saving up some cash and have been thinking about getting a good complete to get back into riding.,Right now i am stuck between two choices.,http://www.veinbmx.com/bmx-extreme-,people who use BM bikes to just bike around are truly the scum of the earth,I hate to be THAT guy but this is not BMX. None of these bikes are set up for a race and would most likely explode at first push from a gate. Pegs are just a liability, a proper rear sproket is going to need some badass lugs(that's how it got started).,Cruising to the skate park/park-n-ride can be fun but, as a former racer, seeing no ""true"" bikes makes me a little sad. Do what you love but it's a shame that this is the state of the sport.,Your fun may now resume.,agree,sounds cool back in the day i had two bmx bikes, a torker, and a cooks bros. the cooks bros was a better all around bmxer but the torker withstood abuse way better, dont see many people riding bmx bikes these days,Get the Amber, although I have no personal experience with that brand and I have had good experiences with hoffman, I recommend the Amber because its a full chromo frame. When the manufacturer says full chromo main frame that doesn't mean all tubes are chromoly and usually means that the top tube,downtube, and headtube are the only chromoly pieces the other tubes are Hi ten steel. Which is a weaker frame. The fact that the Amber is also cheaper is another reason why I suggest it over the Hoffman. I have had some experience with Hoffman parts and they hold up reasonably well, I have absolutely no experience with completes though. From the specs on the Amber it sounds like this would be your best bet and if you decide to really stick with bmx you wouldn't HAVE to replace the frame although you might have to replace everything else since I don't know the quality of their parts. With the Hoffman you will definitely have to buy a new frame if you start getting semi-serious but the overall parts may hold up better than the Amber parts. So if its only between those two I say get the Amber.,Over both of those I would recommend the Kink Whip from Dans Comp its between the price of the hoffman and the amber and it has a full chromo frame with decent parts. This is strictly my experience so coose what ever one you want.,second line I meant to say Chromoly main frame instead I accidentally said full Chromoly main frame.,ride JCPCs they are god tier pedals,dude think about getting rid of those sharp edges man,nice build but dear god get rid of that post man. they only real point of them is for it to be more comfortable to sit on when they have some height on them.,remember that drama between ian shwartz and catfish? could someone explain that whole deal to me?,Not BMX, but used to ride this some years ago. I miss it.,Forgot pic...,Bike trial!,http://www.sourcebmx.com/bmx-bike-s,You are a massive snob,What the fuck are you on about?,So racing is the real form of BMX...?,Can't post a pic but know everything on my bike,Sunday forecaster sweet 17 purple 20.75 TT,Kink empire forks black,Sunday freeze TL stem black,Kink lynx bars sparkle navy ,Purple odi longnecks with doughnuts ,Shadow Corvus headset purple ,Shado Corvus BB purple ,Fit 19 cranks black ,Odyssey twisted pcs purple ,Odyssey bluebird chain ,Sunday saber tooth sprocket ,Shadow umbra railed guts seat post,SE bikes railed seat ,Shadow raptor LHD hub laced to an animal RS ,Shitty ass salt front stick wheel that I don't care about ,Animal MK3 pegs ,And nothing less than the best fit FAF tires,what can you tell me about shadow raptor hub? i plan on getting it soon,my friend has one. sick hub but overpriced. not as loud as i expected it to be.,Why do you all have the seat so damn low? Its fucking uncomfortable to peddle and sit down at the same town.,they arent commuter bikes we dont sit down while pedaling genius. the seat is low so its out of the way for doing tricks/drops etc.,Sure m80, you just do it to look 'cool',Why have one?,look at the first bike in the thread. my POS rig. is that enough seatpost for you? just enough to pinch while being low enough not to get in the way. and i can sit down and pedal, not that i really do. i havent ran my seat slammed for about 4 years mate and i like it that way. if someone wants to run slammed because thats whats 'cool' dont be a douche about it and leave them to it.,0/10,thanks, i hope they are strong enough for street abuse,Yes sir, specifically slolum style sprinting on huge tracks and huge air over jumps because if you used the brakes you lost.,Or it used to be.,just the glory days my son... just the glory days.,Seat is originally intended to be low because in a race you never sit down and you need the range of movement to shift your weight.,no, unless you have superman legs it is nearly impossible to pedal a BMX racer on a level ground. You HAVE to stand up for enough strength (disregard for all these 7-11 hood ornaments posted),can grab/pinch for tricks and feels better than the frame when u bail and land on top of bike,go and make your own thread we are talking about FREESTYLE bmx here. all of these questions were asked in the context of bmx freestyle.,NO YOU!,Thread is BMX Thread, I have more right to be here then you but w/e. Freestyle biking is sporting and fun but BMX is Bicycle Motocross, offroad and competitive.,Besides most of the good freestylers I've seen would love the ""trick"" potential of step-ups, you can get wicked air.,look mate the year is not 1991. freestyle is ten times more popular than racing now. when someone says bmx freestyle IMMEDIATELY comes to mind for everyone wether they ride or not. your views are EXTREMELY outdated. oh yeah and our freestyle bikes are way stronger than race bikes and would not 'explode' like you say but only be slower due to weight and geometry. you are cancerous to both bmx racing and bmx freestyle.,i thought it was for doing higher bunnyhops,6.5/10, nearly got me.,post your bike then if its upsetting you so much. If this is getting to you then I dare you to go check out the current racing scene, I know you will be far less impressed.,also 25/9 is practically the same as 44/16. Do you even understand gearing? Its not harder to pedal if the ratio is still the same, i comes down to sizing and how fast you will be peddling. A sprocket with 25 teeth will fully rotate much faster than a 44 tooth. The reason racers run large sprockets is because it allows them to cover more ground in a single rotation, where as a tiny sprocket would likely require two rotations (estimate) to cover the same ground. With all that said most racers still run 44/16 gearing which feels the same as a 25/9. ,I don't think you have ever raced or if you did it was some back country uneducated league.,I got mine off Craigslist (whole rear for 150) it's fucking great,ITT: Niggers and their Nigger activity trophies.,Not sure how relevant on a bmx, but the chain tension on the 25/9 will be almost twice that of 44/16, causing more wear on chain and sprockets. Also on the axle, come to think of it, so you'd need to tighten the nut a lot more to avoid the rear wheel creeping forward. Don't bmx, though, so not sure if this is a problem in real life.,I've got an old powerlite I've been meaning to fix back up. I've had it since I was 7 so OFC it's gone through some hell. figured I could reuse the frame and start from scratch, what do you guys think?,In BMX, there will be a lot more wear on the chain with a 44/16 because then the chain will have less ground clearance than the pegs meaning when you grind, sometimes you'll be grinding on the chain instead of the pegs.,It'd be a cool bike, but you couldn't actually use it for anything serious. That frame would bend/snap jumping a 3 set.,just a cruiser, maybe take it down a light trail or something. know where I could get started with part?,parts*,Man I haven't ridden my bike in years. It's a cheap stock I know but I loved it. Been thinking of building a bike. Any suggestions for frames? I'm a causal rider, not really trick heavy,while I have never had a problem with my wheel moving you're right about more wear on smaller sprockets. I'm not talking about doing tricks just peddling the smaller sprocket will wear quicker.,why not keep the one you have?,been thinking of a change, should i keep it? whats your guys opinion on haro frames. (this is a forum intro lite),Any Sunday or Cult OS,God tier,Riding a pells fiction 2011, can't wait for WTP Envy 2013,I would keep it and put those brakes down, if you don't use them for tail taps or tailwhips they're pretty useless IMHO,My nigga.,I always suggest sunday, but if you can, order off Albe's. They have a $25 lifetime warranty for frames on top of the factory warranty.,Unless you want to slow down or stop. You probably ride slow as fuck.,bumpin' with wallpaper,The only problem I have with no brakes is going down this huge ass hill downtown in cleveland.

"Anyone actually contemplating buying Wrestlemania?,Most of the card looks like ass but there are some matches I expect to be fucking fantastic and am extremely excited.

That's the talent of Taker right there.,Taker losing would be really interesting.,But I know WWE hates being interesting.,Well it would require a LOT more attention then they've been giving. If Taker ever does lose it, it will be a HUGE thing.,Wow, really? Wrestlemania? That shit's all fake. Why are you arguing?,IT""S FAKE, WHAT?!,I don't have to face this conundrum, since the sports bar down the road is buying it instead & putting it on a wall-sized screen.,Look at it like debating whether a movie is worth paying to buy on DVD instead of just pirating.,would be really stupid to give the streak to a person who is going to take a break after wm.,OP, it's ten dollars more expensive than last year. Unless it turns out to be a damn great PPV, just waste that money on something else.,But think about it, Punk has the urn, what if for the entire WM match Taker is beating him senseless, but then last moment Punk offers to exchange Takers streak for the urn, then there's silence and The Undertaker agrees.,Jack Swagger isnt good enough.,That's so stupid, I wouldn't put it past Creative.,Contemplating if its worth seeing for free at my friends house. ,Does it seriously cost $70? WTF you can buy two good video games with that, or a bunch of good movies. ,The card sucks. I don't even care who wins.,some local bar around here is showing it. might b cool.,If you don't want to buy it or deal with a shitty stream, just wait until the next day and torrent it, PPVs are always all over the internet in HD within an hour or two of ending. Plus you can skip through all the shit that way and just watch the good parts.,Lel I am going to give them my money.... CAUSE I AM LE GOING XCP,Spic living in spicland here. ,I'm paying just 15 bucks to watch it on a local bar in a huge ass wall sized screen. And those 15 bucks include a portion of french fries with parmesan cheese sprinkled all over it. ,I can't imagine you americans actually paying 70 dollars for that shit.,Rock vs Cena has been horrible so far,Brock vs HHH has been built well,Punk vs Taker is a joke. Everyone knows Punk has no chance. ,Fandango vs Jericho has been pretty good,Hell No vs Team Ziggler has been average.,Divas division is dead. ,Del Rio vs Swagger has gotten some decent build up,Ryback vs Mark Henry will be a nice bathroom break,Shield vs Sheamus, Orton, and Big Show is cool. I'd like to see the Shield really wrestle. ,Doesn't look like a bad Mania at all.,Nice get but:,no it hasn't,That's not the point,No it hasn't,By far the best rivalry WWE have got going right now,Nope, we've seen variants of this same shit for the past few PPVs,I was going to buy it since I'm home for easter but I think I'd wake up my parents from marking out so hard at 4am,hmm maybe it will be wor-,NOPE,Who what?,i'll just wait for the wwe network,This might be the first year I don't buy it. When Jericho/Fandango is the best match on the card, something is terribly wrong.,Now I see why all of you want to come here illegally.,On a side note, I have a steamgroup made since FirstRow doesn't have a comments section.,http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CE,I don't expect them to cater to me, I expect them to produce something worth buying/watching.,Which is their JOB as an entertainment company. It's not a matter of me not liking Cena or Rock it's a matter of we all fuckin' know Cena's going to win and the feud has been pretty shit since Rock isn't even around half the time and Rock had a piss-poor showing at EC and the match last year wasn't even very good so why would this one be any better?,Again, I don't expect them to cater to their audience so they might actually want to buy their product (an odd notion, I admit,) but they just expect you to buy it and enjoy it no matter what they do and that's a load of shit. Half the matches weren't even decided until a week ago.,Buy it? Pfft. I'll wait until about 2 hours (or less, depends on uploaders) and download a HD rip.,Just got to avoid Facebook, Twitter, This Place, and anywhere else in case of spoilas.,The idea is they put on a good product I'm willing to pay for then I give them money not I give them money and then they maybe put on a good show,Only HHH and Lesnar is worth watching. And HHH is going to win so even that is going to be a bore fest.,pleb,Ordering it with the help of some friends and watching it on my glorious 107"" HD Projector screen while niggas in my neighborhood drive by all jelly they aren't allowed inside.,Seriously though, I know the card kinda sucks, and it's super predictable, but it's kind of a ritual me and some bros have to watch PPVs, especially Wrestlemania.

People around here read the word LARP and instantly think of that ""lightning bolt"" video which is a touch/light contact larp, not a combat sport.,Foam padded combat sports, try again...,Look dude, what you are doing looks like a great past time, big fun and nice people. Unlike Fencing, Kempo, Kendo, Gumbdo, Hema or SCA it is not a sport but a role playing game gone wild.,You asked, you got an answer. You can now either go back to /tg/ or stay here, because honestly, nobody feels bothered here, it is just that most larp fags hang around /tg/ anyways.,Unlike SCA? Are you fucking serious? Have you seen an SCA court? More roleplay than I've ever seen in any other combat game, with the awards and having to address the ""royalty"" as Majesty and bow when they walk by. Fuck that shit. ,I got yo back OP. I saw the new /asp/ section and just knew that a Dagorbro would find their way here.,You mean every striking sparring martial art?,Yeah, you're right, SCA is pretty retarded. Does not make Dagorhir any better, just some more dressed up duded hitting each others with foam padded sticks.,So if you asking does anyone who trains serious swordsmanship, be it western or eastern, respect Dagorhir as a combat sport or sword training, the answer is nope.,If you ask can I hang around with my freak sport on /asp/, then sure, make yourself at home.,FTFY,You seem rather bothered that people from boffer fighting groups consider themselves a sport.,you seem rather bothered that people don't consider your game of tag with foam swords as a sport,Dag is definitely not sword training, I agree. It's a game/combat sport with an evolution away from general realism of combat in the past due to a limited understanding of actual historic combat techniques, and safety rules removing the option of striking in the face or head. ,Thing is though, there is an increasing trend in Dag these days to involve historic techniques, mostly of a german nature, but including some eastern influences as well. ,Anyways, original topic has been answered, so I'll just move on. Dagorbro's sound off?,Ohio Belegrim, reporting in,Excellent point about the pro-wrestling.,The striking surfaces of the gear are padded, just like in many martial arts (karate, etc) the striking surfaces (hands, feet generally) are padded during sparring and tournaments.,There are two (main) ways to do it: pad the equipment, or armor the individual (if you're doing one of those crazy sports that don't do either, more power to you). ,Karate, taekwondo, boffer sports, etc. do the former; kendo, SCA, EMP, etc. do the latter.,Sure, some people dress up funny and have fun doing it, but it doesn't really change the basis of what's going on.,Money allowing, I'd do all of it; SCA, ACL, Dag/Bel/Amt, HEMA, MMA, all that good shit. Thing is, Dag/Bel/Amt have the lowest entry cost and are a hell of a lot of fun, and they are what I have available to me.

"Can we get a Kung Fu thread going?,There's MMA and Boxing, as well as Krav Maga, but I see no Kung Fu!,A real martial artist is proficient in both fighting techniques as well as the beautiful, artistic side of their art! Where most karate and tae kwon do schools fall short is their artistic merit -- when they begin to spar, they forget their teachings and resort to mere kickboxing techniques!,Know this: a good fighter and a good martial artist are two different things. The fighter will win a fight, yes -- but the martial artist will win a fight with grace and beauty as well as tenacity!,Then you're either blind or to stupid to use the catalog function. There are several threads around.,I practice Northern Shaolin and plan to soon begin practicing Southern Praying Mantis because I've got to move away from where I am now. My sifu's sifu traveled across China before WWII learning skills from the greatest martial artists of both Southern and Northern styles. During the Japanese invasion, he would teach his techniques to laypeople so that they could defend themselves. I believe that martial artists should all be of such moral goodness.,These sports -- MMA, for example -- are corruptions of an art, focusing only on the fighting aspect of martial arts. They disgust me.,You just butthurt that someone with 3 months of muay thai and judo training would be able to fuck a kung ubermaster up.,Sure, learning strictly through form practice takes longer to master, but it allows the kung fu artist to truly show their art while fighting. Someone with 1 year Judo experience would probably out-fight someone with the same experience in kung fu, but if both had 10 years experience the kung fu artist would become the better fighter.,The first three years of kung fu training is supposed to be entirely conditioning.,I'm a practitioner of Ving Tsun (wing chun), 4 generation student of the Moy Yat lineage (Yip Man> Moy Yat> Moy Tung> Aaron Vyvial> Me), People always put things in terms of years of study but truly to equate experience and skill one should look at it like learning to fly: your Kung fu is equal to the number of hours of intensive training...,If it wasn't for the fact that 10 years of experience in Muay Thai leaves the practitioner without joints...,I can't agree with your argument here. You say 10 years leaves Kungfu better off.. whats your basis for saying this?,The beauty in a martial art is a well-executed technique. If it's just some flashy shit that doesn't work, it should be dumped.,Guess that means their shit doesn't actually work.,In the movies, yes. Not in real life.,I think he means to say that short term Muay Thai will make you a better fighter at the cost of longevity, when compared to Kung Fu. the problem is that comparing Muay Thai to ""Kung fu"" as a general idea is the same as comparing Muay Thai to ""martial arts"". Like comparing a fork to ""silver wear"".,Well, without arguing the better fighter, the cost of Muay Thai is certain.,You are correct, the OP should clarify what type of Kung Fu they mean...,I think here is a good point to define three categories: sport martial art, martial art, and martial science...,You wanna start then? I have some idea what you mean, but what would you call marital science..,To wit: Sport Martial Arts- combat sports that focus primarily on point marking within a regulated rule set with a secondary focus on technique or form.,Martial Arts- combat systems that focus primarily on form and technique that often supersedes practical application.,Martial Science- a combat system based on proven sciences like bio mechanics, anatomy, kinesiology, geometry and physics. Form and technique as well as practical applications are derived from these proven sciences.,I feel like this needs clarification again, as somebody doing MT among other things, form and technique are paramount, but practicality is also..,Maybe we define it differently? You mean forms, such as katas? And technique, as in moves that may/may not play a role in a fight?,These are rough definitions but I think it gets the idea across. Another note I might add is that martial sciences are willing to change to assimilate better proven techniques or theories.,The difference between doing something adherent to the system or doing the most efficient action for the particular situation. Also the motivation for the nature of the technique. Is your martial practice based on tradition or scientific scrutiny?,Mine? Uhm.... probably tradition/other(effectiveness)..,Except that in most case a form is a series of techniques stringed together to teach the artist each individual technique as well as what may lead up to those techniques and what a useful move may be after doing such a technique. Forms are literally just there to teach you how to fight -- EVERY movement has an application. If you encounter someone who knows a kung fu form, karate form, etc. and any one of the movements DOES NOT have a practical application (even if that application is intimidation), they are incorrectly practicing their martial art and are instead merely dancing.,Forms are the nucleus of the system yes, but that's doesnt translate to efficacy. Examples: most animals styles of Kung fu fall short because they imitate animal movements rather than choosing the most effective way that the human body works.,What?,Yes, but that's where fighting style comes from. Sure, there is probably a most technically effective set of fighting moves that can be used. That's not the point. If I want the most effective, I'll buy a gun.,A good martial artist will win most effectively, and save all the 'grace' for when him and his friends are circle jerking each other in their McDojo.,So, a good martial artist will just buy a handgun and carry it with him. Nowadays, guns are common enough to make that realistic. What's the point in even learning a martial art? You're not doing it for the sake of the art, you're not doing it for the sake of pushing your body. You're doing it to win in a life-or-death fight. So buy a gun. It's a lot cheaper than learning a martial art. It's a lot more efficient than learning a martial art.",,"03/29/13(Fri)14:41,03/29/13(Fri)14:44,03/29/13(Fri)14:48,03/29/13(Fri)14:56,03/29/13(Fri)15:00,03/29/13(Fri)15:38,03/29/13(Fri)15:39,03/29/13(Fri)15:47,03/29/13(Fri)15:50,03/29/13(Fri)15:57,03/29/13(Fri)15:57,03/29/13(Fri)15:59,03/29/13(Fri)16:08,03/29/13(Fri)16:12,03/29/13(Fri)16:12,03/29/13(Fri)16:19,03/29/13(Fri)16:23,03/29/13(Fri)16:24,03/29/13(Fri)16:39,03/29/13(Fri)16:48,03/29/13(Fri)17:05,03/30/13(Sat)23:06,04/01/13(Mon)19:34","Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,MYVT,MYVT,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,MYVT,MYVT,MAI,MAI,MYVT,MYVT,MAI,MAI,MYVT,MYVT,MAI,MAI,MYVT,MYVT,MYVT,MYVT,MAI,MAI,Anonymous,Anonymous,MYVT,MYVT,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"

Skating basically just turns your ankles into rubber. ,But I still get it every once in a while and remember getting them when I first started skating.

Just chipped the deck today though, so I think I'm gonna switch to the one I've been saving for a while now. ,My most impressive trick is probably a casper, and I mean a real fucking casper that you kickflip into and out of without anything but your board touching the ground.

I like freestyle though, really want to learn some more Mullen shit over the summer.,Krooked are p great, as iseverything from DLX Dist.,my trucks used to be that loose and that would be all I would ride,then I tightened them,however it's going to take a while to get used to being so tight. I almost ate shit a couple times just trying to do the shit I'd normally do with loose trucks out of habit,we're not in 93 anymore. its the equivalent of a walmart board at this point.,I don't think there's really any turning back at this point. I'm too in love with my loose trucks. I never really improved until I loosened them.,this is what children actually believe,maybe it's not pop I dunno, either way it's a lot easier to do tricks, at least for me, with tighter trucks.,you don't have good balance, so instead of getting good board control with loose trucks you chose a stable platform and substituted stability for turning (what trucks are built for) and rebound,anyway, my paracord came in today, hopefully i can go out tomorrow to test this out. i know you guys were getting wet over this.,p sure I have good balance,just trying out different set ups,but alien workshop are the best,anon please,enjoy your tic tacs,I probably need lighter trucks. ,I'm on a Bustin maestro mini, it has mini kicks at both ends, it's also a drop-through.,I can sort of ollie, I've never measured how high or how far I can do it,umm I do freeriding except without any standy slides.

Gravis are chill though. Too bad the company is over, except for backpacks in japan.,Yeah but how durable are janoskis anyway, i heard they are pretty durable, i might just keep buying supermarket $5 shoes that'll last 2 weeks and just keep wearing vans or another type of shoe for chilling.,janoskis are tumblrcore as fuck ,go with Half Cabs, Old Skools, or Nike SB Koston 2 use Shoe Goo tho,I saw a guy at the park a couple days back who I swore had longboard wheels on his deck. Probably why he was struggling with ollies, but it actually seemed like a good idea. I stopped skating a couple years back and only picked it up again with a cruiser to get around town, with my old setup just gathering dust I thought that slapping longboard wheels on it would make it generally more commute friendly.,Didn't get to talk to the guy and ask about it though, he just kinda rolled by. That's my old set in the pic, Fury EVO trucks and all so I was thinking just putting risers and 59mm wheels on it.,That oughta work right?,not surprised, aweful shoes for skateboarding, get some suede next time,Just for future reference, 'Other' is not for items of clothing, it's for bearing, bushing, griptape, etc... this isn't a /fa/shion thread.,skateboarding is at least 50% faishon.,this is what your average skater looks like,fuck that was me when i used to skate. not literally me just the style and randomly starting mosh pits everywhere.,Yeah that should work.

Are there any tips or tricks I should know?,i didn't. i was in it for dat scene chick pussy.,Cool then. I'll give it a shot.

How long have you been climbing? How expensive is climbing? Do you think courses could be worth it or would it be better to befriend a climber? What has been your toughest or tallest climb?,why do you sage ? ,depends if ur bouldering, sportclimbing or doint multi pitches,if you have a good climber as friend you should be ok, altough a course never hurts,7B boulder , working on a 7C projekt atm,tallest- about 180m wall - 3 rope lenghts,i want to get into climbing. Will being short be a disadvantage when climbing?,So jealous. How long are you in Font for?,It can be a disadvantage, but there are many ways of getting around reachy moves. There are disadvantages for being tall, too, though. I wouldn't really worry about it.,How tall are you?,163cm here.,Probably gonna head up to Sandrock, and maybe hit up Horsepens 40 as well.,Being short is in no ways a disadvantage. If you look at some of these youth climbers, some 9 year olds can climb v10 +. It's all about strength,same size,,I wouldn't agree that it's all about strength. It's a lot more to do with flexibility and balance, but strength obviously helps,Aye climbros!,How's it going everybody.,Just learned the basics of leading last night, and it seems pretty easy, I'm excited to add that to my arsenal.,Sport climbing here I come!,Swiss climber here, looks like there is plenty of things to do in some part of USA. Why travel only in Europe then?,One week, the weather looks a bit humid, but if it doesn't rain, then conditions will be really good. Already been there? It's my first time.,A lot of good climbers are small. But you will probably have some problems in gyms, they build more reachy moves. You won't have any problem outside, look at some children climbing, it can be really impressive.,I go on an annual basis, been quite a few times and i still feel like i've barely even scratched the surface, you'll love it. My favorite area is either Isatis or Cul De Chien, i recommend both.,i live in ca, and have only been climbing for a year, so i have plenty of stuff left to do around here that i can hit in a weekend. i'll start expanding eventually, though.,find some climberbros. you have a gym nearby?,it will just mean you use a different style than a taller climber. some reachy stuff will be a lot harder, but in general you'll be okay.,fuck yeah. so much more pucker-factor than climbing on tr.,Going to Seneca next week, first time multipitch trad climbing. I'm scared.,I just happen to find out it was a sport and i got hooked. A year. Depends on what you want to do if theres crag nearby etc; if you have no equipement it should go from 70-80$ up to 200$ for your basic stuff. You wont have a rope thought, it can go up to a few thousands if you're into trad. Its always better if you have friends, i dont think courses are necessarry, i started bouldering and i learned to rope climb afterward (a friend i met bouldering showed me). But if you can make friends its always better, since if you want to not bouldering you need a belayer. Tallest around 200m or so, hardest V7 and 5.11 sport climbing.,I wanna do Castleton. But cant decide on Kor-Ingalls or North chimney. Any thoughts?,Yo climbers!,I'm going bouldering outside for the first time ever tomorrow.,I climb indoors a ton, and I can do about a V4 on sight, V5-V7 I need to work it a few times, and V8+ is just a far off dream at the moment.,My question is: how different is outdoors versus indoors?,Will I be able to flash V4s outside? Will I do better? Worse?,There are rock climbing festivals in april in Turkey. I'll be at Kaynaklar Climbing Fest. ,http://www.rockclimbing.com/routes/,you probably will do worse, but it depends what type/style of rock you will be bouldering. if its similar to gym like porblems then you may be good.,at my place outdoor boulders have more small crimps and demand another kind of technique than indoors. ,indoor is perfect to build up max-strengh and stamina but you'll have to know how to bring it to the rock,Cliffs are not tailored for the average height climber.,Have been out of commission for about two years trying to let a big stint of tendonosis to heal up. Went back to the local climbing gym to start with and needless to say I was embarrassingly weak. Looks like I'll be sticking to working out on the hangboard at home for a few months.,Hangboard is a supposed to be used in conjunction with climbing, it's not a replacement for it. If you want to climb better, climb more. Doesn't matter if you're starting from v0 or v5 after injury, same applies.,Yes and no. Th guy who opened the route imagined some moves corresponding to his height.Children can have some problems on some routes (it can be easier if they hold some small crimps). But the size isn't a problem, except for dynos (dynamical moves), that's the only exception in my opinion.,Anyone here thinks 8a.nu community sucks? I mean, according to the messages on forum, not on people that have an account or just past there to watch video or nice pics.,Family,Since last July, so I guess 18 months give or take,Bouldering is cheap, rope climbing(outdoors is expensive) ,I think having a friend that is starting out is the best way to start climbing, so you can both track your progression and feed of each others energy. there was a guy teaching another guy some technique in my gym today. The problem I usually see with one person teaching another is that the teacher is a beginner, and therefore doesn't know what they're talking about/gives bad advice/beta. Courses definitely seem interesting, but I'm not sure how good of a way to meet other climbers they are. Most people I see doing courses are couples. ,V8 boulder. Couple hundred feet? Can't really remember.,To be honest dude, I never hear any strong climber say climbing is about balance and flexibility. When you're starting out climbing, sure. But when you're getting to send like V6+ strength becomes very important. A person that is strong and has good technique is the good climber. I see tons of new climbers with so-so technique and they can barely send V3.,Like , said you probably will do worse. Not necessarily a ton worse but outdoor climbing usually takes a little getting used to. (Especially topping out). Hands will probably get torn up more outside. If you can do V5-V7 after a couple tries in your gym(and the grade is close to outdoors) then you can probably onsight V4.,I'm quiet amused about the statements and controversies jens (site admin) produces :D,and how people like to wine a lot about jens' subjective point of view..,Different types of rock suite different physical appearances: Height, Weight and Finger sizes. You might be able to optimize your performance by specializing in certain routes/boulders:,Short/Skinny = Long overhanging routes/competitions,Short/Muscular = Very steep bouldering,Tall/Skinny = Long vertical (trad) routes,Tall/Muscular = Vertical bouldering,Of course, there are exceptions: Chris Sharma, Jorg Verhoeven and Josune Bereziartu have performed well in a variety of forms.,Type of rock vs. size of fingers and heigth,Limestone pockets = Children/Women (small fingers),Limestone tufas = Big hands,Granite lists = Tall ,taken from 8a.nu,Brilliant, just the thread i've been looking for.,Going to be joining a climbing club shortly when i get home, looking to progress onto some outdoor climbing, could anyone recommend a decent pair of climbing shoes to go with for a beginner, a few friends of mine have just bought Climb X and Red Chilli's.,Anyone got any suggestions?,Strength is definitely an advantage, but i'm not muscular at all and i'm on V7/8 problems. Maybe the climbing centre i go to just sets predominantly techy problems.,Strength doesn't automatically mean muscularity, especially in a sport like rock climbing.,Like just today, I saw this very skinny guy boulder an easy route using only his hands and then proceed to do 21 pullups at the AND climb down the same route.,I had a great day at the climbing gym today, finally solved 2 routes that had been troubling me for a while.,It depends you are going to climb often or not. But I think you should try some higher standards if you climb often, with some good rubber. The rubber in red chilli doesn't look great (I never wore some but that's what it's looks like, if anyone tried, tell me). ,After, 5.10, scarpa, Evolv, Mamhut, la sportiva for example are really good brand. If you find one of this shoes at a decent price that fit your feet, last year model or discount, buy it. It's still quite expensive but the shoe will last.,Red chilli is what one of the senior instructors where i work reccomends, i've been looking into the evolv geshido sc, looks to be fairly sturdy shoe, need to see if anywhere around me sells them so i can get in for trying a pair on to see if they feel right.,Sturdy is the word. I had one pair of evolv (which I don't use often now), they look indestructible. But the problem is the pair didn't adapt to my feet( a shoe never fit perfectly, but it goes better usally). ,But try as much shoe as you can, at gyms you can often borrow some.,planing on joining my local rock gym warehouse in April with my bro.,Hoping to get in better shape and be more social too.,whatever company you choose, GO WITH LEATHER SHOES! leather molds to your feet and doesn't reek nearly as much as synthetic does.,i have 2 airs of la sportivas-nagos and mythos-and love them both.,Yo, me here!,So, my first time bouldering outdoors today, it was pretty wild.,Had a rough time with V0s and V1s whereas in the gym, they are a joke.,Flashed a few really brutal V3s, one that involved throwing to a crazy mono-pocket.,Worked a V5 ... astoundingly challenging.,I think the bouldering here is weak though, it's unbelievably crimp-y and there are no feet. ,Overall, outdoor bouldering was cool, but not something I would totally get into, seems really dangerous, and while it may be cool other places, outdoor bouldering is not for me. I'll stick to my safe landings...,Next week: my first time outdoor roped-climbing, and hopefully my first full lead climb.,How's everyone else going?,Yeah I have the mythos too as my fuck around shoes,Comfy as fuck,Pretty good, been mtn biking in the meantime until it is warm enough to climb.,Definitely get into outdoor climbing, its so much more satisfying to send challenging routs on natural rock.,I have had to carry a friend to a hospital with a broken+dislocated ankle, not fun. 1 year on and she still is recovering. Make sure to land on the pad kids.,Going bouldering in jtree in a week. And v0-v3 probs I should check out?,i love my mythos. they're not super aggressive, but i recently spent nine hours in them doing a ridge traverse and i felt fine. they're great for friction, too.,probably gonna do bishop, ca again at some point in april, like fucking everbody. any word on the fresh granite spots opening around mammoth?,boohooo. I know that feel, I'm going to climb in south of France in two days and it will rain tomorrow at least.,what type of rock? will the rain fuck it up? a good thing about valley granite is that it doesn't give two shits if it gets wet.,if you're having fun you're doing it right.,This. I'm a fatty and can barely do a v1. I have a lot of fun and my friends are supportive. The hardcores are usually busy doing things to care.,went to pinnacles national monu-er-*park* today. mostly for a hike but brought my shoes too to do a bit of bouldering. ended up just being extra weight-fuck climbing that choss without a rope.,Never seen it broken down like this, but it makes sense. I'm tall and built (former lifter who refuses to try to lose mass), and overhanging crimpy routes just destroy me, but anything with pinches/slopers and not too overhung is my jam. Also, compression problems make me happy.,since questions like ,get often asked i try to give an answer to my best knowlege,those advices are more&less for beginners:,its my opinion that specific training isnt necessary till the climber/body has reached a certain level. however also in the beginning you can have produktive or contraproduktive sessions in the gym.,heres how a session should look like:,15mn+ proper warm-up on big holds, traverses or very easy routes (prevents injuries, gets your system ready),2h+ hard stuff: try to climb/train/boulder as hard as possible but also have just fun and enjoy trying hard things (this is the power training part of your session),30mn of climbing rounds or routes again on big holds (also prevents injuries,muscel sores, helps to recover faster and trains your stamina),it is very important not to get pumped forearms cause it prevents you from training at your maximum. if the warm up gets you pumped then climb easier!,time and intensity for sure can vary, its all about the structure,atleast 2 times a week!!!! ,I'm pretty new to this topic but i think i understood some parts:,-what and how to eat before during and after a session,before: i usually try to eat high carbohydrate food 3-4 hours and maybe a fruit 1-2h before the session.,during: the session i prefer liquid energy stuff since its much more fast in your system. something like oranges, apples fruits.. or energy drinks,after: so i read it is considered to eat within 30mn after the session to have a healthy muscle recovery. carbohydrate and protein food here,-feel free to add your training/nutrition perspective, i would be happy to discuss also more specific training sessions,As a beginner myself, the advice I was given was: Above all, get comfy shoes.,I got a pair of La Sportiva Mythos. They're leather, and of all the 6 different shoes I tried on, they were the most comfortable. Later, I have seen them being recommended as good beginners shoes.,imo what pushes mythos away from being beginner shoes is their cost. $150 is a hefty commitment for someone just getting into climbing (especially since they also need a harness, chalkbag and atc all at the same time, which is, at minimum, another $100).,that being said, my wife's first shoes were a pair of mythos.,Just got myself a pair of tenaya ras!

"Sup /asp/, this *is* the proper board for skiing and snowboarding, right? It's not really /sp/ material, yet I haven't seen ANY posts in here about skiing or snowboarding. Let's change that. It's still pretty cold up north, the season ain't over yet.,Seriously, I can't express how shocked I am that there are literally NO skiing or snowboarding threads here, yet piles of fucking WWE threads. ,Anyways, some questions to get the ball rolling:,1. Ski or board?,2. Where do you shred?,3. How many years of experience do ya have?,1. ski,2. Ohio, and it fucking blows. Go up to NY (Peek n Peak usually) whenever I can, though.,3. 12+ years on skis. Been boarding a few times, though.,1. Skier (also telemark),2. BC,3. 22 years (1000+ days),1. Ski,2. Blue Mountain PA ,3. Got back into it this year but when I was a kid maybe 7 years.,I really want to move out west so my season is more than 2 months long.,1. Ski,2. Austrian Alps,3. 14 years,1. Board,2. Austria,3. 13 years (started at 7),I've been skiing since I was 3 but haven't done it in 3 years because snowboarding is just way more fun. Recently I got into riding in parks more often. How the fuck do you do a boardslide over a box or rail? 50-50s are quite easy.,1. Board,2. LVSSR, Big Bear CA, Brianhead UT,3. Many years but this was the first season I've been able to hit the slopes in the last decade,Which is more expensive gear wise, Skiing or Snowboarding?,If you're talking about buying new, current tech gear- then they're about the same.,But used ski gear seems to be really cheap compared to boards.,My setup cost about 800$ this year but I got brand new boots and last seasons skis. You can get everything for much less if you buy used.,1. Ski,2. Austria, Italy, France,Mainly Zillertal, Wilder Kaiser and Dolomiti Superski,3. ~17 years,freeskier,WA/OR,23 years,4.Year/Make/model of your skis/board,Snowboard,Austria,only 2 years but already ~110 days,I go to peak n peak sometimes. Last time I went up there I cracked my head open. Was a good time.,1.Snowboard,2.Alps,3.14, before that 8 years of skiing.,I have a pair of Head skis. Got them used many years ago, no fucking idea if they're ""good"" or not, but they're parabolic and a good height for me, they get the job done.,Next purchase I wanna get is a pair of twin tip skis. I guess that's the new master-race. Wasn't like that 5+ years ago... Glad to see it's still evolving at a good rate.,Also I'm jealous as FUCK of all you west coasters, especially the BC people. East coast USA fucking blows dick for skiing. ,Also, I'm a longboarder, and I thought I'd enjoy snowboarding, but in truth I just fucking hate having my feet strapped into a board. That's why I stick to skiing.,Just came back from an hour park,Well, that depends on how you're skiing. If you never ride switch there isn't really any reason to get twin tips.,It's gotten to the point that the East Coast (Ohio and non-Adirondack NY, haven't been to VT) is so fucking boring I'd love to start hitting some slopes switch from start to finish lol. Most slopes are 10-30 seconds long, tops. :(,That sucks. What about parks?,There are some really legit parks in Ohio and PA (Capital Park at Mad River Ohio and The Streets at Seven Springs PA), but as a skier rails scare the fuck out of me (that ballsack-smash is always a looming fear of mine).,I also don't understand how people do grabs with poles on.,I also never really cared much for spins cause I never had twin-tips and always wanted to start with a 180 instead of a 360....,I'm not sure if these are legit concerns, or just bullshit excuses I'm making. I do love me some jumps, tho. Just never really do any tricks off of em.,Well, I wouldn't call them bullshit excuses, but maybe legit questions that do have answers. And I don't think I've ever seen someone get a rail in between their legs.,I'm interested in learning how to snowboard. Do I really need an instructor, or can I just rent equipment and just sorta try it out? I don't do much of anything right now besides lifting weights, but going on a road trip to the mountain and spending all day boarding sounds like it could be really fun.,1. Board,2. Crested Butte, CO,3. About 8, I've taken breaks here and there.,4. Ride Machete GT with Union Force bindings and 32 prime boots.,Either works, but you'll most probably learn faster with an Instructor. And if you don't live right next to mountains, you won't ride that often and it might take a while without Instructor.,Snowboarding is kind of hard to pick up if you've never done a board sport. Skiing is a lot more intuitive.,Boarding is a lot harder because you're locked in and you'll fall often. Whereas with skiing you're just kind of standing forward. ,If you want to snowboard I'd recommend asking a friend to teach you or get an instructor. Instructors are pretty awesome since it's their job, and they can teach much better than a rider.,Is following an instructor very expensive? How much do they usually charge/how long are sessions with them? I'm afraid even just trying it out will be very expensive, and I don't have that much money :/,1. Board,2. South Central Alaska,3.15 years riding, only about 8 serious years though.,Moved to Colorado for school and absolutely hated the riding there and moved back to Alaska after graduating.,I'm that guy,I've got some '06 Völkl Racetiger SL and even though I'm 6'2"" they are only 164cm long.,I really like the shorter skis and the are hard enough so that they don't become unstable at higher speed.,The tradeoff might be, due to the smaller area of contact, that in deep powder you tend to sink in further.,But I'm in the market for some new skis since the edges are pretty much done.,I've also got some rather nice Dalbello boots.,Some advice: Don't cheap out or just buy the first boots you like. Take this as a lesson I've learnd the hard way. ,I grew out of some boots and bought quickly bought some cheap new ones.,They sucked, hard. ,And it's not just comfort you might be sacrificing but some serious control over your skis as well.,How's the snow in Zillertal right now?,It was pretty awesome a month ago.,And the websites and webcams still look rather good,Haven't been there since, due to the fact that I'm a 4h drive away and don't have the money to blow to go down there every weekend. Altought I would really like to.,University shit is really cutting into my ski time this season as well.,Yeah, tell me about it.,My local resort has an instructor package. You get gear, lift ticket and 3 hours instruction in a 4 person class for nearly the same price as gear rental and lift ticket at the window (vs lift ticket online at discount). Totally worth it IMHO.,And ,4. Smokin' Boards- I'm guessing like 7-8 years old, but didn't see much use. They make very high quality gear. Drake LTD bindings from same timeframe.,I'm actually glad sunday is the last day for the season at my local resort- I've fallen behind in Russian 111 because I spend too much effort on snowboarding (guilty of wasting time on 4chan also),I'm effectively ~4 semester behind, because my season starts in October and ends in May. It sucks, but what can I do.,You can watch ebay/craigslist and snag some good used gear, be on the slopes for under $100 if you really watch the auctions. Lift tickets are the killer. Liftopia,com is awesome, If I buy like a week before I can get a $60 lift ticket for $32 or sometimes even $25.,Definately not a cheap hobby though.,Just out of curiosity, why did you hate riding in Colorado? ,I'd love to ski Alaska some day...,bump cause of all the WWE faggotry.,I just wasn't a fan of the whole resort scene, and after Alaska the Colorado snowpack just wasn't the same. being a three hours from any actual mountains was kind of lame too.,1. Ski,2. Gstaad, Switzerland,3. 5 years experience,There are WAY more alps people in here than I was expecting. Didn't realize 4chan was so global...thought it was mostly US and Canada. Cool shit. I'm fucking jealous.,For those who have...which is better:,BC or the Alps?,I really enjoy skiing, but I fucking suck at it (I do medium runs).,How do I get better?,Ski more.,Take a fucking lesson, you cheap piece of shit.,Don't forget to tip.,That's kind of difficult since I live in one of the flattest parts of the nation,Tried nordic?,Lessons. In my first year of skiing I went from the bunny hill to the blacks in one season due to weekly lessons. Thank you ski club. Also note that I'm talking Ohio, so the blacks here are basically greens/blues in most other places :/,So, you an Ohio downhill skier. Cursed by geography, your options are limited.,Yup, pretty much. Only upside is that there's pretty good skiing in NY less than a 6 hour drive away. And if I wanna make a 10+ hour drive I can get up into the Adirondacks.,How do you people LIVE?,Yeah I can ski (and completely flatline) blacks where I live (which are easier than greens are in normal ski areas).,That means you're being a little bitch then. Go get lessons, watch some videos, and make some turns man. No excuses.,Haven't had the taste of the West coast forbidden fruit yet. Bout to go to Colorado for the first time early May to ski A-Basin. FUCKING STOKED.,But yeah man...fucking sucks. Looking to move out of this shithole of a state as soon as I graduate uni.,I'm in Lancaster, Blue is by far the best in the state,1. Ski,2. Blue Mtn Pa...I prefer Stowe Vermont, but I can never get up there,3. 5 years,Straightline, Bode! Straightline!,haha, what? skiing is way more expensive for equipment.,hahaha, you were on the front range weren't you?,Ski,Australian Snowy mountains usually, they fucking suck 80% of the time, but it's cheaper than flying somewhere every year to ski. When I can I do though, best I've ever had was in Japan at iwatake and hakuba,14 years and counting,Yup, stuck in Fort Collins for four years,local hill had a week of 22+ cm's per night drop, felt like i just got 2 tickets to paradise.,1. Ski,2. Ruapehu, Nz. Too warm for good snow, but at least there's interesting skiing on volcanoes. (tfw no monies to huge overseas skiing tour),3. 11 years,1. Snowboard,2. I learnt at indoor snowdomes, but my home mountain is Combloux in France,3. 4 years but I strated racing this year for my university and managed to place 3rd in our region,That's pretty sweet. (The racing part, I have no opinion on the snowdome),learn 180s first and then do 180s onto boxes. then do a sliding 180 while you're on it.,1. Snowboard,2. Maryland,3. something like 11 or 12 years I honestly don't know anymore,4. - Forum Youngblood Team 148cm, - Flow The Team bindings M/L, - Burton Hail or DC Super Park boots,Photo dump,no fucking way,free skier ,reppin the southeast appalachian (NCfag) (app ski mountain mostly, best parks in the area),i've been skiing for 9(?) years started getting into park/free skiing the last few years,Jamie Pierre held the record for cliff drop at 255ft for a few years.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RYk,1. alpine board,2. alps (Austria),3. 6 years (2 alpine),What board do you ride?,1. Ski,2. Midwest at a place called Granite Peak,3. Been skiing park for like 3 years now and but learned way back as a kid.,4. 2012 Armada Halos,board.,colorado.,18 with about 7 years of 150+ day seasons.,1) Ski because I'm not a faggot,2) Minnesota and various places in the west, moving to Utah soon because of skiing,3) 14th year skiing, started when I was 6, skied about 70 times so far this year,1. Ski,2. Ontario, sucks because to go anywhere good I need a couple hundred bucks,3. 8 years,Do most people ride park or mountain? Always wondered,Fellow bros, any tips on glaciers, slopes etc. that stay open during northern hemisphere summer?,No indoor bullshit please.,You might want to try Zermatt, the highest lift goes up to 3900m, but the ""slopes"" up on the glacier are probably not worth the effort.,also,1)Board,2)Alps. Don't have a regular place, since I'm from northern germany and can only go there on holidays. Favourite places of mine are Ischgl and Skiwelt Wilder Kaiser Brixental.,3)7 years. Before that 10 years of skiing.,I ride a NITRO Rook, twin shape, flatline profile.,I'm mad jelly, do you get paid to ride?,There's a glacier in Tignes/Val d'Isere but it was sketchy at best when I was there, especially for the boarders.,Yeah, the front range provides a bit of a misrepresentation of Colorado riding/ skiing. ,Pfffft,Hintertux Glacier is nice in summer. Has a good park, too.,1- ski,2- CO,3- 20+ (ski very few days a year however),http://youtu.be/IGDkPKw2FWg",Skiing & Snowboarding General,"03/27/13(Wed)02:23,03/27/13(Wed)03:08,03/27/13(Wed)03:52,03/27/13(Wed)04:42,03/27/13(Wed)05:20,03/27/13(Wed)05:25,03/27/13(Wed)05:36,03/27/13(Wed)05:42,03/27/13(Wed)09:12,03/27/13(Wed)09:55,03/27/13(Wed)11:33,03/27/13(Wed)11:36,03/27/13(Wed)11:54,03/27/13(Wed)12:01,03/27/13(Wed)12:10,03/27/13(Wed)12:11,03/27/13(Wed)12:14,03/27/13(Wed)12:16,03/27/13(Wed)12:22,03/27/13(Wed)12:35,03/27/13(Wed)12:53,03/27/13(Wed)13:13,03/27/13(Wed)13:26,03/27/13(Wed)13:27,03/27/13(Wed)13:29,03/27/13(Wed)13:29,03/27/13(Wed)13:34,03/27/13(Wed)13:43,03/27/13(Wed)13:45,03/27/13(Wed)13:47,03/27/13(Wed)14:01,03/27/13(Wed)14:04,03/27/13(Wed)14:05,03/27/13(Wed)14:07,03/27/13(Wed)14:11,03/27/13(Wed)14:13,03/27/13(Wed)18:38,03/27/13(Wed)20:11,03/27/13(Wed)21:03,03/27/13(Wed)21:16,03/27/13(Wed)21:27,03/27/13(Wed)21:32,03/27/13(Wed)21:33,03/27/13(Wed)21:34,03/27/13(Wed)21:37,03/27/13(Wed)21:43,03/27/13(Wed)21:44,03/27/13(Wed)21:45,03/27/13(Wed)21:49,03/27/13(Wed)21:51,03/27/13(Wed)21:53,03/27/13(Wed)21:58,03/28/13(Thu)00:35,03/28/13(Thu)00:48,03/28/13(Thu)01:06,03/28/13(Thu)01:13,03/28/13(Thu)02:32,03/28/13(Thu)02:59,03/28/13(Thu)03:09,03/28/13(Thu)05:10,03/28/13(Thu)07:37,03/28/13(Thu)09:02,03/28/13(Thu)12:45,03/28/13(Thu)13:13,03/28/13(Thu)13:18,03/28/13(Thu)13:23,03/28/13(Thu)13:24,03/28/13(Thu)13:24,03/28/13(Thu)13:29,03/28/13(Thu)13:30,03/28/13(Thu)13:31,03/28/13(Thu)13:32,03/28/13(Thu)13:47,03/28/13(Thu)13:54,03/28/13(Thu)14:09,03/28/13(Thu)18:43,03/28/13(Thu)19:16,03/30/13(Sat)12:16,03/30/13(Sat)13:01,03/30/13(Sat)19:45,03/30/13(Sat)22:03,03/31/13(Sun)12:43,03/31/13(Sun)15:22,03/31/13(Sun)16:02,04/01/13(Mon)08:41,04/01/13(Mon)09:39,04/01/13(Mon)12:59","Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,J.R.

"While they aren't as fast as sprinters, that doesn't mean they're slow. They are quicker at running than anybody who isn't a sprinter because of their light weight and speediness. Long-distance runners can also sprint for a longer time than thier counter-parrts.,thoughts?,bump,they will be bad at sprinting compared to a sprinter, look at a sprinter, they have really bulky muscles so they can generate power and speed more quickly.,a long distance runner will never match their speed.,can a sprinter tag a long-distance runner if he is placed 100 meters apart?,why are my runner anons?,*where*,it depends on what distance the sprinter runs,if the sprinter is a 100m athlete, probably not. he'd have to run 200m before the marathoner runs 100m, which is almost impossible (WR 200m times are around 19 seconds, and even untrained people can run 100m in 15-16 seconds),if the sprinter is a 400m athlete, probably still not. WR 400m times are around 44 seconds. WR marathoners run 26.2 miles at a pace a little over 4:00/mile, or 1:00/400m. at that pace, it'd be a close contest to see if the sprinter can cover 400m before the marathoner covers 300m. however, the marathoner would most likely be able to run faster than his marathon pace for 300 meters,the shortest distance sprinter that can probably tag a marathoner with a 100m head start would probably be an 800m athlete,There's a dude called Pavel Tsatsouline (?) who says you can have both strength and endurance. He claims the key is to become to become really good at the particular movement and do it as much as possible at low intensity. So you basically train how effective your brain uses what you got. If I got it right.,Apparently he trains ultra marathons with about 30 km (?) a week at a really slow speed just to get at good ate the movement, while being able to do strength training days later. It's kinda different approach. Would be interesting to know how good he's at sprinting.,I meant he does one rather long run every week.,http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blo,well here is the thing though, a long distance runner is moving at a brisk jog but they are not moving at an all out sprint, they would need to be in a sprint to keep distance and I think a full sprint would tire them very quickly.,that is a very specific level of exertion, they are used to sustaining a medium-high burn for a long amount of time but not to dump all the fuel into the engine all at once.,I'm currently on a training plan similar to this. I use to only be good at distance until I started this and now I can hold my own in sprints.,Distance runner here, can't sprint for shit. Taller lanky guys tend to be better distance runners while shorter guys with more muscle mass are better suited for sprinting.,Which board is running best suited for? I've never tried to talk about running on 4chan, but I figure it would be better to ask the anons that were in this thread rather than /q/.,/asp/ is really slow, I refuse to go near /sp/, and /out/ seems decent but only allows trail running.,every now and then there are some quality running threads on /fit/ believe-it-or-not. but your mileage may vary.,I don't think height matters for long-distance running. Records were broken by 5""3 people and 6""3 giants. As not as you're too short like a midget or tall like 7f.t,you're good.,Long-Distance runners underestimate their speed. Obviously, a sprinter beats at short distance but they can out run any danger that hits them like a bunch of gang-bang members with weapons. They probably don't even run more than half a mile.,How good can you get at a movement that you don't practice properly? I mean maybe if the endurance tasks are simple,I think the Tarahumara for instance are particular short people compared to some of the african runners.,Rather good I suppose if you're an athlete anyway, but I reckon you'd be inefficient compared to someone who does.

"Ok so I train in Muay Thai. If I wanted to punch and kick harder, do I just kick more or would weights/machines do anything?,also martial arts thread,fuck off to /fit/,LOL,if your master can not tell you this you need to go somewhere else,and if you are not training under a master you are not doing muay thai,They told me to fuck off back to here.,Kick more. Do yoga or something, become flexible as fuck.,Weights and machine exercising would eventually result in muscles that obstruct your kick/punch motions, unless you only build those ones.,Thanks a lot.,What are you, some kind of weeaboo faggot who's watched too many kung fu movies? Muay thai has trainers, not masters, you fucking nerd. It's a full contact combat sport, not some japanese bullshit martial art with a belt system and self-procclaimed ""masters"".,Karate,Muay Thai,Mein nigger,Weight training will help, but not very much. What you need to do is practice with good form and then build up speed and increase the power you put into your blows until you're striking at max power (with good form so you don't injure your self, of course).,What happens on a physiological level is you are training your brain and nerves to recruit more and more muscle fibers per signal. You don't use 100% of your muscle fibers in a given muscle to perform an action, you just use what your brain thinks you need to use. You'll punch harder and faster by training to punch harder and faster, as you'll develop ""muscle memory"", which is the common term for your brain getting its shit together and recruiting more muscle fibers per impulse.,This is the reason for ""newbie gains"" for weight lifting. When you very first start weight lifting, you don't have the pathways developed to use a majority of the muscle fibers all at once, so you can only push low weight. As the pathways develop, and they develop rapidly, the amount of weight you can push will increase rapidly, until you have trained the pathways to recruit the majority of muscle fibers, which is when you hit a ""plateau."",So.. Is this now a Muay Thai General Thread?,Just keep hitting the bags and pads. Repetition and conditioning will help you. Sparring as well. ,Just don't do stupid shit like roll metal bars or rollings pin on your shins to toughen them up quickly. That'll make them brittle. The only proper way to harden your shin and deaden the nerves is by kicking.,you are so wrong and it's funny because you think you're right,Muay Thai doesn't have the McDojo syndrome that karate and kung fu have. Because of the fact that you have to spar and train against resisting opponents, it doesn't have this bullshit about masters and lineage. ,There are specific honorifics in Thailand for highly-regarded instructors but nowhere near the cult worship that karate and kung fu have. ,Oh, the only belts that matter in Muay Thai are champion belts.,Muay Thai instructors are called masters, not trainers. You go to your gym and learn how to kickbox from some white guy who learned how to kickbox from some other white guy, you are a not learning muay thai, they are throwing a buzzword around as a selling point because people like you don't even know the difference and just want to do what the cool UFC guys are doing.,Unless your teacher was at some point a muay thai fighter in thailand you are not learning muay thai,Kick a tree with your shin.,Kick it over and over again until your shins no longer feel pain.,That's how the masters did it.,That's how Thailand does it.,And it's worked out pretty well so far.,Instructors of Muay Thai are called Ajarn or Kru. ,And there's a world of difference between kickboxing and muay thai. Muay Thai involves kicks, punches, elbows and knees. Knowing to fight and defend yourself from the clinch is a must. I'm well aware there's bandwagoners who jump on the Muay Thai market and pass themselves off as legit MT instructors. ,Tell that to Thom Harinck. He's the founder of Chakuriki Dojo, one of the premier Muay Thai gyms in Holland. Harinck was a former Kyokushin karateka that learned Muay Thai after his team was defeated in a challenge match in the 70's. Harinck blended Muay Thai, Kyokushin, Savate, and other striking arts. And he was never a Muay Thai fighter yet produced champions like Peter Aerts and Branco Cikatic.,Unless you're in Thailand. Don't do that. Just kick bags.,so what you are saying is he did not teach muay thai, he ripped off some techniques to make his own system,He did teach Muay Thai. He spent some time training in Thailand. He sends his fighters to train over there and he's had regular fights against ranked Thai boxers and champions. ,Harinck's particular gym blends Muay Thai with other stuff. Nothing wrong with that because he still teaches the fundamentals like teep, chap kho, etc. ,Google Charkuiki and Thom Harinck and see for yourself if he's not a legit Muay Thai instructor or not. Harinck and Jan Plas, the founder of Mejiro Gym are the 2 men who brought Muay Thai in the Netherlands.,And I mean his fighters not himself. Harinck has some experience as a fighter but his true strength was a trainer.,They're called master. You a bullshit.,This. Kick it with every part that can kick, then punch it, use your elbow and knee. Most people just think about muscle and forget their bone's training.,but you say he trained in thailand learning legit muay thai from someone and obviously during his training he fought other people too, thus my point is valid.,meanwhile in most places you have some guy that picked up cardio kickboxing after watching UFC and decided to teach ""muay thai"" as a personal trainer in a synergy, which is what most people throwing that word around are doing.,What's with this hardcore purist attitude? ,Your're basically saying you can't drive unless you learned from a Nascar driver.,for example, what if someone says they do karate but don't actually learn from a karate teacher, they are learning something that adopted some moves the teacher picked up from watching karate.,then its not karate, don't call it that. Same with muai thai, just because a kickboxer learned how to clinch and throw elbows from watching other people do it doesn't mean they are trained in muay thai, they just know some of the moves.,if I use a tiger claw on you I am not going to say I am a tiger kung fu practitioner,Did you just pull a Tony Stark quote for Muay Thai?,/fit/ told u to fukk off to /asp/ and /asp/ told u to fukk off to /fit/ - reminds me of that song -where do u where do u go???????????-anywyz i told u jumping squats, ankle weights shadowbox, kick a tire that is secured to somthing, roll ur shins,Don't kick trees.... that causes nerve damage. Thai fighters don't generally go past 25 because of the damage to ones body. Unless fighting is your only income... ,Also, that's banana trees, which aren't *quite* the same.,For those arguing how legit various gym's Muay Thai might be.. Arjun Chai DOES have certified instructors, and going to Thailand is not part of that.,Fuck, do you understand how the human body works?,To OP, read SS, develop a more powerful musculature, and your connective tissues, joints, bones, and muscles(all muscles) will get stronger.,That means you'll kick and punch much harder too.,(You need to increase the strain muscles are placed under, and kicking a bunch won't do that, only somehow increasing the resistance, which is easiest with weights.),Nerve damage helps you kick harder.,It also leads to permanent injuries. There are other ways to kick harder without damaging self...,yup micro fractures heal to become harder that why people like my cousin can break bats with ther shin- dont try that tho its fukked plus ther are two types of bats one breaks way easier that the one they use in demos the maple one is way harder but i seen him do it but he got a lil hurt,you kick harder by kicking adding more resistance by kicking a heaver bag.,And now for some good advice: do it all. Increase your body strength and mass with weight-training. Specifically core and leg strength. And for kicking and kneeing even more specifically would be to really incorporate additional strength exercises for your hip flexors.,Simplest would be to follow a strength routine with some additional exercises and keep practicing your kicks and punches against heavy bags.,This is horrible advice. Do not listen to these people. They are either trying to get you hurt or have been misled themselves. ,The only way to truly get stronger is to increase the resistance of the strike. Boxers do this by using weighted gloves. You could easily use a weight vest, ankle weights or the like to gain the needed weight to make a strike harder to perform.,You a Thai fighter?,You'd know about tree kicks if you were.,Someone already said it earlier: they kick banana trees.,Do you have banana trees where you live? No? THEN DON'T FUCKING KICK TREES YOU DUMB TWAT. Use a heavy bag like a person with a brain, don't sacrifice your body unless you're a professional.,Increasing resistance won't help nearly as much as training his brain to recruit more muscle fibers per impulse. You do that by practicing your technique with consistent form and progressively building speed.,You can be super buff and have 80inch arms but still punch like a girl if you don't train the speed and ""muscle memory."",then how do you become the best? ,shit, hit your shins with bamboo if you're too sissy. close enough,Have fun with blood clots, stabbing leg pain and arthritic knees then. There's a reason why you don't see any old Thai fighters in the ring.,Do NOT do any weightlifting with your legs,,Do NOT start kicking trees.,FOCUS on flexibility and speed.,Super Mach speeds can only be obtained with enough flexibilty.,Other then that just train kicking everyday, 100 reps with both legs, each kick everyday.,This was bruce lee's way of training kicks,is that particularly intense training? I used to do 75 each leg on the bag as a warm up before even starting my technique practices,u are a fuuking idiot and obviously never fought. ther is no point having strong kicks if your shins cant take the pain if some1 with trained shins checks your kick you will be rolling on the ground crying dont talk about topics you know nuthing about,you are saying the exact same thing i said about ankle weights and my advice is bad? what a moron and if u dont think u need to train your shins to compete on high level i got a bridge for sale,First of all, proofread your posts. You can probably find a spell checker to embed in your browser.,That's why you practice on the heavy bag, preferably one that is still stiff. If you fuck yourself up by say, breaking a shin or chipping it, you're going to be knocked out of training and your skills will suffer as a result. It also assumes that the only weapons in your arsenal are your shins, which is completely false. It's not the science of Eight Limbs for nothing dude.,If you follow the wiki, the banana trees they use have the same consistency as a training kick bag. So yes, there's no real need to kick oak trees unless no training partner is willing to take kicks for you.,I agree with every aspect of your post beyond your comment about rolling your shins, which I assumed was a suggestion to use a rolling pin on your shins. It's stupid and doesn't work. It weakens the overall structure of your shins in the long-term and raises several long term health issues. That level of brutality is needless, a stiff heavy bag works just as well.,you are an idiot thats what all high level strikers do- champions but they are wrong you are right -never even kicked a heavy bag and giving advice. kick bags numbs your nerves and so does rolling them its a rough sport and not for everyone and you are damaging your body regardless but rolling your shins does not do any more harm than kicking the bag or going shin to shin it just compliments these training techniques and even fixes pain if you know what you are doing you start gradually with a towel wrapped around a wooden poll- anyways pointless explaining to you...all theory no practice you will get this kid killed with a false sense of hope cuz his opponents are training the real way,Capital letters. Periods, Commas.,Learn about those, motherfucker.,Wow, what a shitty thread I have stumbled upon.,If you want to punch or kick harder, practice your form on a heavy bag. This will give you the best feedback and also help with toughening up your shins. Don't hit them on anything hard. Don't roll a stick down them. And especially don't punch with weights or use ankle weights. They're bad for your joints and if you take 5 seconds to think about it, they add weight to your limbs in a downward direction. Unless you're having problems keeping your hands up or throwing uppercuts, its not going to help your punches or kicks.,Also, weight lifting is gonna give you all kindz of strength gainz (and speed). Work on form first, though.,fixed,And you decided to make it even more shitty, eh tripfag?,Actually he is completely correct. Rolling shit on your shins is a bad idea.,kinda ironic that the tripfag with ""sweet_science"" in it doesn't even understand Newtonian physics.,I learn both.,Go ahead and try and be a smart ass about it. Im telling you it doesnt work. I know from experience. At the end of your punch, the weight pulls your arms down (or hyperextends them) regardless of the negligible resistance on the horizontal plane. If anything, weights 2.5-5lbs might help with shoulder endurance, but thats it. But please, continue the discussion so I can watch you dig a hole for yourself.,Also, ""sweet science"" is a homonym. Partly because I have a bio degree, and partly because boxing is known as ""the sweet science"".... which you would know if you had any experience in boxing. Which you don't.,Let me summarize that post for you:,Kick with attached rubber ropes.,Here is how Buakaw does it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCqn,Do you have anything of legitimate input, or are you just going to continue getting asspained and shitposting?,This post will look like shit i think,no we didn't,even if you're a world champion, it's not a good idea to go above 2 lbs, let alone 5 kg. If you go higher than 2 lbs, you'll get slower long term because your muscle fibers will learn to twitch slowly.,you have ZERO idea how to train,op needs to lift explosively and follow linear periodization, not this unsupported broscience ancecdotal evidence bullshit,Been doing some extra bag work after training, maybe 5 or 6 rounds, noticed slight increase in muscle and vein bulge",,"03/28/13(Thu)13:09,03/28/13(Thu)13:10,03/28/13(Thu)13:14,03/28/13(Thu)13:19,03/28/13(Thu)13:37,03/28/13(Thu)13:38,03/28/13(Thu)13:39,03/28/13(Thu)13:47,03/28/13(Thu)13:47,03/28/13(Thu)13:50,03/28/13(Thu)13:53,03/28/13(Thu)14:10,03/28/13(Thu)14:10,03/28/13(Thu)14:28,03/28/13(Thu)14:30,03/28/13(Thu)14:34,03/28/13(Thu)14:39,03/28/13(Thu)14:42,03/28/13(Thu)14:44,03/28/13(Thu)14:44,03/28/13(Thu)14:47,03/28/13(Thu)14:52,03/28/13(Thu)14:53,03/28/13(Thu)14:59,03/28/13(Thu)15:05,03/28/13(Thu)17:20,03/28/13(Thu)17:29,03/28/13(Thu)17:31,03/28/13(Thu)17:34,03/28/13(Thu)17:36,03/28/13(Thu)17:41,03/28/13(Thu)17:42,03/28/13(Thu)17:44,03/28/13(Thu)17:44,03/28/13(Thu)17:52,03/28/13(Thu)18:00,03/28/13(Thu)18:23,03/28/13(Thu)18:50,03/28/13(Thu)18:52,03/28/13(Thu)19:02,03/28/13(Thu)19:21,03/28/13(Thu)19:25,03/28/13(Thu)19:32,03/28/13(Thu)19:36,03/28/13(Thu)19:38,03/28/13(Thu)19:56,03/28/13(Thu)22:55,03/28/13(Thu)22:57,03/28/13(Thu)23:05,03/28/13(Thu)23:07,03/28/13(Thu)23:08,03/28/13(Thu)23:26,03/28/13(Thu)23:53,03/29/13(Fri)01:17,03/29/13(Fri)01:18,03/29/13(Fri)01:29,03/29/13(Fri)01:30,03/29/13(Fri)01:57,03/29/13(Fri)02:02,03/29/13(Fri)10:27,03/30/13(Sat)00:55,03/30/13(Sat)02:02,03/30/13(Sat)03:51,04/01/13(Mon)08:15,04/01/13(Mon)13:33,04/01/13(Mon)13:38,04/01/13(Mon)13:42,04/01/13(Mon)13:42","Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Feelbrah,Feelbrah,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Mademoiselle pomf , ,03/28/13(Thu)14:59 ,Mademoiselle pomf,!!AHUgWpLIX/u,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,cry moar chunners,cry moar chunners,Anonymous,Anonymous,cry moar chunners,cry moar chunners,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,cry moar chunners,cry moar chunners,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,sweet_science , ,03/29/13(Fri)01:17 ,sweet_science,!!WKOk/yAqod/,sweet_science , ,03/29/13(Fri)01:18 ,sweet_science,!!WKOk/yAqod/,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,sweet_science , ,03/29/13(Fri)10:27 ,sweet_science,!!WKOk/yAqod/,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"

He's so fast he makes the races boring as no one can catch him.,Millsaps and Alessi just proved at Daytona they are supercross babbies.,Anything other than a perfect track with berms any novice can rail, and they struggle to even stay off the bottom of the pack.,Well, Alessi, sure. He usually starts really well, sometimes even getting the hole shot, but four laps later he is either in fifteenth place or on his side.,As for Milsaps, you may be right, but I still want him to give Villapoto a run for his money! Last season was boring- there is no point in watching if the same guy wins again and again by huge margins. I like to watch races, not parades.,I don't mind people winning by huge margins - just shows how good they are and fair play to them.,We don't get coverage in the UK any more - except for FIM World Motocross, so I have to download all the races.,But chech this out, Gautier Paulin at the Thailand GP was pulling off a double tabletop.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3E,better version:,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgD,Love watching supercross and motocross. I own my own bike, a '05 KX250F. Would like to hit up a motocross track but I'm in a really flat part of my state. Love riding though,Is this real life? MX discussion on 4chan?,I was rooting for Millsaps (Who wasn't?) But unless Poto makes some huge blunders, I don't think he can win. ,Also, I have an '06 Honda 250f. I pretty much ride exclusively tracks, but I did some desert riding at Ocotillo Wells for the first time last weekend.,(Pic related),Nice spot.,So it's Friday, 830PM.,Who's been prepping for the weekend? Got the bike filled up, and have 15 litres already premixed, probably wont need all that. Got a spare filter cleaned and oiled, ready to go if I need it.,Just gonna ride my track with a friend for a few hours, maybe again on Sunday and Monday. It's been dry for 4-5 days now so the track should be nice and soily, without being dry.,Don't forget your chain tensioner.,Just got back from a local track. There are like 6 tracks within an hour drive from my house here in So Cal,Lucky. We have a few decent ones but they're always over an hour away.,4strokes are killing the UK MX scene,How so?,Sheer noise. A full line up of 4 bangers is a hell of a lot louder than mostly two stroke races of old,Premixed?,Glad to see someone still running two strokes as well.,Oh, all of the tracks in So Cal are pretty far from any sort of residential neighborhood (or anywhere that the noise would be a problem) so sound has never been an issue.,I don't like 4-strokes. Love the noise of a two stroke. Don't think I'll ever get a four.,Recently tore my ACL and medial meniscus riding.11' CRF450R. Cams, high comp piston, race gas tune, FI mods, ecu tune, FMF exhaust header to slip on, had the rake changed, A60 with carbon hubs, MX51's, 13/48, Protaper S/E windham bend, kevlar grips. Just threw a fresh top end in the old bird. I was rooting for Barcia even though he was a rookie but he did well for his rookie season with all the competition.,ACL? Fuck that noise. Nice bike though - I don't think I could ever tap the power of a 250 2T or 450F.,We recently got a 2 stroke only class again in N.I. and it's awesome, a few really quick guys who are constantly on the pipe.,http://vimeo.com/62202422,The ACL wasn't even the worst part of the injury surprisingly. 2 strokes are so much fun to ride. I wish I had a 125 lying around to play with. 250's are hard to keep on the pipe because that powerband is so god damn violent.,I do ride in sandy areas so the 450 is needed to be competitive. I know for a fact if I had some nice clay to dig into I'd rip my arms out of their sockets. I'm thinking about getting some head work done and some kibble white valves.,If you have a small to medium sized track 125s are great. I had a ride on a CR250 the other day on a small track, and right through every gear all the front end wanted to do was lift, all the low down power just trying to throw you off the back, it was awesome.,Can't beat a good sand track every now and then. Just stick it into the corners and make your own berms",,"03/27/13(Wed)10:47,03/28/13(Thu)09:32,03/28/13(Thu)09:33,03/28/13(Thu)09:42,03/28/13(Thu)09:46,03/28/13(Thu)10:16,03/28/13(Thu)10:34,03/28/13(Thu)10:39,03/28/13(Thu)10:41,03/28/13(Thu)10:50,03/28/13(Thu)10:56,03/28/13(Thu)10:57,03/28/13(Thu)20:20,03/29/13(Fri)05:04,03/29/13(Fri)16:27,03/29/13(Fri)16:57,03/29/13(Fri)17:40,03/29/13(Fri)18:18,03/29/13(Fri)19:37,03/29/13(Fri)21:15,03/29/13(Fri)22:14,03/30/13(Sat)03:20,03/30/13(Sat)07:17,03/31/13(Sun)02:29,03/31/13(Sun)11:20,03/31/13(Sun)15:48,03/31/13(Sun)16:20,04/01/13(Mon)14:15","Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"

It's retarded to think that nike trainers would be the best for grip. If he is wearing all this protective gear and professional shit, why wear a fashion choice rather than a more practical option.,it might be for board feel over grip. if he's using vicious and a board with high concave, he's set. I skate in worn vans because I get better feel for the board.,Did that once,Tiny pebble wedged up one of the wheels,Went flying, broken arm,and I never tried it again,once you get over 10mph pebbles don't affect you,plus most longboard wheels(60mm+) can run over pebbles so you may have just been on a shitty setup,wat,It doesn't matter how fast you go, or how large your wheels are.,If the rock is large enough, it'll fuck your shit up,theres a difference between a pebble and a rock,when I say pebble, I mean around the size of a quarter,you mean rocks?,Size is subjective.,You can still get fucked up from a large pebble or a small rock. ,If you start to define the difference between rocks and pebbles, you're splitting hairs.,Now, yes, I started splitting hairs by saying pebbles can potentially be larger in size, but the matter of the nomenclature to the collective mass of mineral is invalid.,rocks dont mean shit if you lean back. and if its big enough to fuck you up, even at higher speeds, you should be able to see it ahead of time and avoid it. whats with you guys not checking the hill before skating it anyways?,are any of you guys on the fish,Skateboarding and Longboarding are NOT the same.

As it stands now I have to make do with sub par spots or spend an arm and a leg getting out to the EU events. Oh well...,Too many internet skaters for my liking.

Get a board with a wheelbase of 27 or 28"". Make sure it doesn't flex.,88a wheels are too hard. Get square lipped wheels between 77a-80a. Right now I'm loving my Rad Advantages 78a. Super smooth slide, crazy amount of grip and awesome roll speed. Sector 9 70mm 78a centerset can also be used for downhill. They grip a little more than the average freeride wheel, but slip more than the average downhill wheel.,Not related : Just received my Fullbag TM-FR. That concave is so perfect. Big enough wheel flairs to keep you locked in, small enough to not hurt your feet (unlike the DB Lunchtray, Nevada Paladin, etc).,88 noskoolz. by far the worst wheel i have ever owned. too hard to grip decently, too soft for any real speed in a park. choppy as hell slides. ,yeah, get new wheels;,i do a fair amount of sliding, any tips on how to do downhill though? im talking about how to find a good run and make sure you dont get hit by a car on hairpins, and just how to manage the logistics of going downhill 30-35+,spotters, and find a single turn and practice your predirfts, it can make staying in your lane easier. ,personal experience: if you see your spotter throw a X, dont second guess.

"Hey /asp/, not from around these parts. I'm just ignorant and pussy about these matters so sorry if this is stupider than I thought.,What's a good sport for getting your aggression out with minimal damage to your body?,I'm pretty fucking tiny, I need to let out steam, and I'll get wrecked so I'm trying to avoid any painful martial arts (i.e. muay thai) for now. Is there a stream of boxing I can get into that doesn't mean I'd be bleeding from my mouth? I think some sort of boxing would be good. Is it bad to just purchase a punching bag and punch away? I'm worried that would lead to problems with improper technique (and if there's a punching bag, I may as well be learning something, right?),it seems to me like you are looking for something called sex,Probably. But I need some sports in my life. Or, at least something that could at least help me develop my control over the body.,Most traditional martial arts will provide what you are looking for. Small guys perfected many of the styles out there.,boy's choir,gotta be a broad, here,so are you saying you are a pretty girl?,If OP lives in NY, I do give private lessons. Nobody gets beaten up if they don't want to.,Stuff like taekwondo?,I'd like something I can do on my own, especially if it'll help with the venting.,OP here. I'm female 5'2 105lbs and I feel like falling may snap me in half. I did SS a while ago and I like weight training so I'm planning on going back to it with more research. I just need something applicable because if I ever get into a fight, I'm so fucked over.,Darn, I'm in Toronto. Thanks for the offer, though.,Just box,make sure you dont suck OP,minimal damage,/ss/ you say?,But really, if someone tries to beat you up the best technique is the ancient art of the 400 meter dash.,If that fails, monkey grabs the peach technique.,You should take up kick boxing for the fitness and the striking skills, but if you are worried about actually getting into a fight you should take some formal self defense classes to.,When in doubt, nut shots, nut shots, and more nut shots, clap the ears, aim for the throat and keep a pocket full of sand just in case you need to throw it in someones eyes.,first rule of fighting is running away at your size you need to do alot of running away. you have a disadvantage everytime you fight with a bigger person. solution fight dirty if you need to fight. ,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-pd,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7d95,hes the scariest man in the world because hes a pretty nice guy but even when hes being nice it seems like hes going to murder you brutally,Yes!

Im a 200lbs 6'4"" dude but I got some good moves from it (only took it for 3 years alongside muay thai tho),See if they have a Title Boxing Club around where you live, or something similar; all you do is punch a bag the whole time and do core work. They teach how to do it correctly too.,it's boxing plus kicks, and kicks are pretty rad,Oh wow, that sounds damn perfect. I may just do this and kickboxing.,My god, /asp/, you guys are such nice people.

If you get pissed and hit things, you're only training your self to hit things when you get pissed. It's science, trust me. There have been psychological studies about it; hitting things when you get mad doesn't make you less mad, it just makes you more likely to fly off the handle, hit someone, and go to jail.,Running will get you in better shape, you'll have removed yourself from the angering stimulus by distance and mindset, increase endorphin levels which make you happier and less stressed, and the adrenaline and raised heart rate from being pissed can be harnessed and used.,Just run, nigga.

Best way to get out of a fight alive is to not fight at all.,Man, it's like I'm an open book on this message board.,you tryin to trick us?,or are you saying you're ugly, for real? if you are, then your self defense is done for you. no one wants to pick a fight with an ugly chick. that's nature guard you have, if you're really ugly. ,embrace it,hahahaha ,or you can be one of the ugly girls that are the pretty girls muscle,I would recommend a punching bag, get a family member or friend who has some experience to show you some basic form and technique. ,After a bit of training you will know enough to not hurt yourself and it's a great way to let off steam, among other things.,you stupid niggers, i imagine most woman are raped on the ground. How can BJJ NOT help? If a woman is on the ground in an inferior pos, and striking won't help get her to a superior pos, then we have knee escapes, butterfly guard and kicks.. seriously, do you even bjj? ,granted, a standing def is always preferred, but if you get punched in the back of the head and thrown to the ground, standing combos and skills wont do jack.,Hitting things when you are angry only trains you to hit things when you are angry. When someone says something stupid, you'll get mad, and then you'll have a strong Pavlovian urge to hit something; there will be nothing around suitable to hit, so you will just get angrier from frustration, and then you'll be in worse shape than you were before because now you're super-pissed instead of sorta-pissed, or you're under arrest because you punched some stupid ho in the eye.,Take up running.,I'm pretty sure the point is to avoid being in a position to use BJJ at all.,I'm not too knowledgeable with BJJ, but if the second person is 2.5x the first person's weight - no amount of momentum and technique would help.,i concur with your point. But why leave a hole in the defense? Running is primary def, physical def is secondary. I'd train for all areas of combat just to be safe.,I've been training in JKD for only 3 years, but i feel i have a decent handle on Kickboxing range, close quarters, mass attack, ground and weapons. Any conflict falls into those ranges. ,Please, at least learn how to bite, tear and pinch correctly while in an inferior position to improve it... The ground is a bad place to be in an attack/street fight situation, but no matter your size, you CAN hurt someone badly... it's just finding the technique. ,please check this out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kino_m,this is the entirety of the wiki pg... not too much:,""Kino mutai (or kina mutai) is a specialized sub-section of some Filipino martial arts that emphasizes biting and also covers eye-gouging. It involves extensive use of grappling, so as to allow the practitioner to control the opponent while applying the techniques.,The biting aspect of kino mutai concerns itself with what targets to bite, how much to bite at a time, and the angle and movement of the bite. Favoured targets include sensitive and easily accessible areas such as the face, neck, ear, groin, nipple, and latissimus dorsi muscle. These targets are also chosen over others because of the difficulty countering a kino mutai practitioner biting them, and hence to ensure that an uninterrupted bite can take place.,The main principle is uninterrupted biting, this means that you place yourself in such position that you can continue biting as long as you want, disabling your opponent from escaping your bites.,Kino Mutai has 12 positions and each position has 4 variations! It can be used to inflict pain, to escape from a lock and it can be used to cut body arteries that can cause severe bleeding."",--http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kino,There's no such thing as ""getting your aggression out"". All scientific tests where participants acted aggressive to relieve it showed more hostility afterward than people who did absolutely nothing when angry. And of the three methods tested, only breathing and waiting patiently calmed people down.,And running, yo. Distancing one's self from the offending stimulus through time and physical space, as well as the delicious endorphins, causes anger to subside.,Driving/riding. When I'm angry, I go for a ride on my motorbike.,No, my friend is the muscle. I'm too spaghetti to do anything.,""getting your aggression out"" probably wasn't the best way to explain it.,You know how sometimes you just get this rush of energy and you're just shaking to do something? Sort of like a, ""I just NEED to get up and move RIGHT NOW"" and it feels like you're ready to go luging or run a marathon? I get that often enough that I can use the feeling towards something productive. I usually go biking until I'm worn out, but it's not always convenient. Thought mixing this with something combative would be nice and fun.,But yeah, learning drums too.,where?,Slacklining Bro.,Just go and do Muay Thai. Some people just go there to be fit, others to fight. Either way there's a lot of (padded) sparring and most people respect the pace you want to go at. ,Also Thai's are pretty small, and they're monsters when they fight.,Swimming.,Hey OP, I get what you're talking about and here is what I think.,If you're looking to defend yourself, I second the running suggestion. I'm a girl, I did a lot of being sleeping outside and travelling on the rough in my teens, and running saved my ass countless times. Self-defense classes are a good idea too. I wouldn't recommend getting weapons unless you know how to use them and the legality where you live. They can be turned against you and knife fights are nothing like you see in movies.,When I started fighting I was also worried about getting hit but when you started it's much different. Depending on class size you may be paired up with people your own size. Most bigger classmates I've had where also good at controlling their strength while sparring. Some gyms have different methods than others so find the right one and you'll be set, as many try to make it a more sportsy and fun thing than a free-for-all fight club. You will also learn how to not get hit. The bruises and ocasional injuries are part of the fun in my experience.,You should keep in mind that most styles that let you ""blow off steam"" by punching shit place a lot of emphasis on strength and contact so you'll definitely get hit back. Those that don't place an even stronger emphasis on technique, so be prepared to spend hours and hours refining your moves.,I would recommend tae kwon do for you. If you still think that's too aggressive, you can try some ""fitness kickboxing"" stuff, the kind that is like aerobics combined with kicking and punching. That puts less emphasis on fighting so if you're just looking for a way to blow off steam and have fun that could be for you.,moshing",,"03/28/13(Thu)23:33,03/28/13(Thu)23:35,03/28/13(Thu)23:42,03/28/13(Thu)23:47,03/28/13(Thu)23:58,03/29/13(Fri)00:09,03/29/13(Fri)00:13,03/29/13(Fri)00:17,03/29/13(Fri)00:32,03/29/13(Fri)00:36,03/29/13(Fri)00:39,03/29/13(Fri)00:42,03/29/13(Fri)00:47,03/29/13(Fri)00:51,03/29/13(Fri)01:11,03/29/13(Fri)01:11,03/29/13(Fri)01:14,03/29/13(Fri)01:18,03/29/13(Fri)01:55,03/29/13(Fri)03:30,03/29/13(Fri)17:38,03/29/13(Fri)17:52,03/29/13(Fri)17:59,03/29/13(Fri)18:01,03/29/13(Fri)18:09,03/29/13(Fri)18:13,03/29/13(Fri)18:19,03/30/13(Sat)09:21,03/30/13(Sat)10:33,03/30/13(Sat)14:17,03/30/13(Sat)14:24,03/30/13(Sat)14:29,03/30/13(Sat)14:46,03/30/13(Sat)14:49,03/30/13(Sat)14:49,03/30/13(Sat)14:57,03/30/13(Sat)15:01,03/30/13(Sat)15:07,03/30/13(Sat)15:20,03/30/13(Sat)15:46,03/30/13(Sat)16:10,03/30/13(Sat)16:51,03/30/13(Sat)16:53,03/30/13(Sat)16:55,03/30/13(Sat)17:09,03/30/13(Sat)17:17,03/30/13(Sat)17:39,03/30/13(Sat)17:48,03/30/13(Sat)17:51,03/31/13(Sun)04:57,03/31/13(Sun)11:41,03/31/13(Sun)12:06,03/31/13(Sun)20:42,03/31/13(Sun)20:45,04/01/13(Mon)15:10,04/01/13(Mon)15:22","Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,sweet_science , ,03/29/13(Fri)01:11 ,sweet_science,!!WKOk/yAqod/,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,princess cest - r.i.p. /sp/ - (...) , ,03/30/13(Sat)14:49 ,princess cest - r.i.p. /sp/ - mood: sad,!!YeOD2H8tURI,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Harper,Harper,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"

Dude's just like Lesnar in that he's a powerhouse who sucks on the mic. He needs a manager to get over.,That youtube vid of him doing a ""man on the street"" interview type thing with typical Americans was pretty good, too bad they never showed any of it on TV,Because they are too busy pushing Ryback to the moon.,when he comes out its like he puts a mute button on the audience,I change the channel whenever this guy comes on,There's always the option of putting him with Kassius Ohno.

"Windsurfing thread,I spent the past week learning to windsurf. I figured: I had an hour to kill one day, so I decided to rent a board. Pretty soon I was addicted. After a few sessions, I no longer drop the sail ever ten seconds, and can sail comfortably at a speed of about fifteen mph.,I had no formal training, but I figured out the mechanics of turning and whatnot pretty fast. My one question is where exactly on the board you are supposed to stand. I reasoned that you stand on the opposite end to the board to where you tilt your sail, i.e if you tilt your sail to the back to turn into the wind, you should stand nearer to the front of the board, since that will ease pressure on the back, correct?,Helpful pic I found regarding sail sizes. I'm seriously considering buying one for this summer. I'd have plenty of opportunity to ride it, and this is a sport that I really want to get good at.,you will get even more addicted once you start planing at higher speeds.,In principle you are right, if you tilt the sail back you need to step a little bit forward. If you plan a tack (turn nose through the wind) you would place your front foot just in front of the mast.,Foot placement also depends on speed.,As a basic rule you should as little weight on your feet and as much as possible hang on the sail (pulling the boom downwards, putting weight on the mast foot as much as possible). ""mast foot"" is where the mast joins to the board. The more you do that the further back you can put your feet because you will actually not stand on the board but hang from the sail - the feet only serve to steer the board and keep it level. ,That is probably the most important rule of windsurfing. To do it efficiently without getting tired you need a harness.,How far do these point into the wind? As much as dinghies like Fj, 420, Laser? More? Less?,usually less than sailing boats.,most windsurf boards don't have swords,Woho!,To gain the most speed and the most fun (and get onto planning speeds) try to place your feet and your weight so that the board is flat - both forwards and sideways.,Start using a harness early, as soon as you can stand for longer periods on the board - get a harness. It's a bit scary at first, but after an hour or so you'll never get out without it.,Then, start planning! I still remember the first scary and totally mind-blowing moment when the board steps up from the water a bit and starts going on the plane!,From then on, you are a windsurfer, and you will start longing for wind..,Where about are you located OP?,This. And once you start planning, slip into the footstraps. Just do it, you'll never want to go without using the footstraps again.,Pic is me in Abu Soma/Egypt. It was taken right before a jibe. Wind was pretty meh, I had a 100l board and a 7.5m2 sail.,If you got photos of yourself windsurfing, post them!,goddamn captcha,Yes, getting into the footstraps was for me a ""i'll just do it""-thing. As soon as you are there, harness and planning in foostraps you're sort of in heaven! :-),Nice pic! ,Here me just after a jibe/tack something in my sort of home-spot in Sweden a few years ago. 100L and 5.7 I guess.",,"03/28/13(Thu)17:44,03/28/13(Thu)17:49,03/28/13(Thu)18:33,03/28/13(Thu)18:37,03/30/13(Sat)07:49,03/30/13(Sat)08:29,03/31/13(Sun)15:08,03/31/13(Sun)15:10,04/01/13(Mon)04:43","Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"
"Is this the right board for a thread on frisbee golf?,I would think so.,So lets get a thread started.,What are your favorite discs for driving, putting etc?,What about techniques, what do you prefer backhands flicks or maybe even overhead(hammers)?,Pic related my favorite driver with a flick.,Noob here. Give me some advice on drivers. ,My favorite so far is the Nuke SS. I have it at 167 gm.,I tried a couple OS's and I couldn't get them to throw right. They end up like dead weight in the air.,bamp,The city I've been displaced to has a good handful of disc golf courses so I took it up as a fun way to kill time with bros outside without hours of driving to go hiking or some shit.,I suck, but it's still fun.,love me some disc golf in the summer,I'm only using Innovas for the time being, as they're the only brand sold in my area. The Beast is currently my favorite. It's nice and heavy, but you can still get a nice hearty throw without too much lean. ,How well do Innovas stack up against other brands? Is it worth paying more for something else?,Innova is def the industry's biggest, but brands like westside and the new prodigy are emerging. GET A WESTSIDE WARSHIP.best mid range out.,Im so happy to see a disc golf discussion anywhere here. Fuck yes you.,Alright the weights on the back don't matter much, every disc weighs about the same give or take a few grams.,Pic Related its more about the numbers you see on the front of the discs.,Drivers want higher speed and glide, but have the downside of greater turn and fade. Just learn to compensate for these numbers.,Someone with more knowledge! Where is your home course, friend? And average score/par?,Eastern PA, tons of courses so I don't really have a home course.,As for scores it depends on the type of course whether it favors distance or accuracy, I tend to do better with distance courses as I am a better driver than mid/distance putter.,WHat bout you? ,And got any good recommendations for solid putters?,I saw the announcment, knew I'd find some of you here. Might have to make this a regular board now.,Anyone have any tips throwing into a headwind? I've been turning everything over, even my most overstable drivers, and I have the first local tourney of the year this weekend.,It's going to continue being windy as balls, but not playing for the past half-year has really fuckered up my drives. So far my upshots and putts have saved me, but I can hardly break 200' on my drives, and I know the wind isn't helping.,Where do I need to start to get my arm back? I know I'm underthrowing a lot of my drivers (Innova Star Monster / Star Destroyer, Discraft Surge Z) but it seems like I have to make a conscious tradeoff between adding power or keeping it accurate. Any secret tips on keeping it low and straight when I add power into my whip, or is going full-power always going to mean sacrificing consistency?,Bampu For More Dg Goodness,Yes it is. We even had a thread yesterday.,Probably any of my Grooves. I've also got this Riptide that can work miracles if I need it to. Heck, it does anything I need it to do short of putting and going left. It can drive, it can midrange, it can fly fairly straight, it can curve right, it can curve HARD right, and sometimes it can roll.,Arrow. Haven't looked back since. Gets me a lot of weird looks.,Beast is a great disc. That and a Flash are my two goto drivers.,There isn't any huge advantage to any manufacturer, just get to know the stability numbers and you're fine.,Lightning Pro U-2 is my favorite putter,Fuck, if you are having trouble with a Monster, you'll probably have to mess with your release angle. Take less of a runup maybe...your throw has to be way overpowered.,I think the issue is more the winds lately. Kansas winds will usually sit around 25+, almost always more on tournament days. It's hell trying to figure out consistency when you have a swing of +25 headwind into -25 tailwind from one hole to the next. I've been trying to figure out the concept of a ""hyzer flip"" for throwing into a headwind (hyzer release that turns over to flat) but I can't keep the flight plate down and it just boomerangs on me. ,On a calm day I still struggle to turn over those big boys, so I think it's just the ""relative velocity"" of the headwind that's screwing me up.,looks like it's time to club down,B-but I *used* to have enough power...,Easier to get your form back when you're not throwing a top speed driver. Don't try to strong arm your drive, just focus on your form for now. Fastest disc I throw is probably a valkyrie.,It's been a few hours, so let's give this a bump.,Perhaps we should share and recommend courses we've been to?,Never played it myself, but Salina, KS must have a pretty decent course, they're hosting the Am Worlds this year. I'm considering going up to spectate since its only about an hour and a half drive.,Go for it, hour and a half isn't so bad.,Let's see, these are all in Texas:,Brownwood has a pretty good one, I think it's Riverside Park? Pretty easy to get to, the course is kind of nice, parking's a bit of a hassle and it took us some time to find hole 1, but it was all right. It's also not too far from Underwood's, which is the only reason to go to Brownwood in the first place.,Sweetwater has one, Newman Park. Fun course, but there's no map and it can be a bit hard to tell where you're throwing and where the next hole is. Each half is on a different side of the park. On the back nine, there's this body of water (at least, sometimes it's there) that is absolutely disgusting. Consider abandoning anything that falls in there.,Abilene is a good place for disc golf. The primary course is Cal Young Park which has a nice variety of holes and hazards along with the coolest hole in the city. The basket is set up in this nice ring of trees which makes for some interesting shots. This is where local tournaments are often held.,There's also Will Hair Park, where you're likely to lose a disc. About half the holes feature some kind of way to lose your plastic, be it someone's back yard, the creek you eventually have to shoot over, or one of the patches of tall wild plant life.,Wildcat is pretty new and a decent place to learn the game. It's nine holes and they're fairly easy, but do note that there are a LOT of trees there. Throw durable discs. On the plus side, there aren't too many places to lose discs here. The course is ""managed"" by the nearby university, ACU, so if campus police sees you doing something against their rules they'll probably throw you out. They don't swing by very often.,Finally, there's Johnson park, which is a little ways north of town by Lake Fort Phantom. It's a new course and it's all dirt. Well, except for the horrid trees, cactus, and stupidly tall grass you can lose your discs to. Expect your discs to skid and land under a nasty patch of cactus. Almost every hold is a narrow corridor shot and there are no concrete tee boxes.,San Angelo also has some nice courses. It's been a while since I was last there, so I can't really remember which was which, but I know there was one where we had to pay to get in. I think locals had a way to circumvent the cost, but whatever, it was worth it. Take care that towards the end there's a fairly long shot you have to make across the lake. I think this one's Middle Concho? It's one of the three Conchos.,Angelo State has a course built on campus. Both times I went we weren't allowed to access it, so I can't tell you about it, but it's a cool idea.,Of the other two Conchos, one is right alongside the river but has this nasty drop along the first few holes. Utter nightmare for sidearms and lefties. The other Concho, if I'm remembering things right, was a heck of an adventure. Half of the fun of that course was traversing it. Sorry, can't remember which was which.,I've still got plenty of places I need to go hit. I've heard San Antonio and Dallas have some awesome parks and one of these days I'll stop by Plainview and check them out.,Oh dg thread I love you. Any sidearm players here? I have been throwing both backhand and side for a while now, sidearm being my more accurate throw for long drives. What does everyone throw for 300ft shots? Say dead straight, wide open, no wind kind of shots?,Lehigh Valley by any chance? The course at Jordan park has always been a favorite,I do. I don't have a very strong arm, so I can't backhand very well.,Riptide. Tilted a bit so it flies straighter.,You ever try Roadrunners? might like em. can be very flippy, but awesome with right snap and angle of release.,let me tell you a little story.,I had been walking in this park for about two months now. There were these weird ass contraptions all around. I have never seen anyone use them, and I was walking for a good two or so hours a day, listening to audio books, at various times a day, almost every day. No one had ever used these strange contraptions.,Then one day theres these two guys. One of them has a frizbee, hes looking at me, and he's motioning to throw it. Now, I live in southern california, near the beach. Like any normal person, when someone motions that, you are suppose to catch it. Of course I fail because I suck at catching, but he wasn't doing this at all. What was he doing? Some stupid fucking sport called FRIZBEE. GOLF. ITS GOLF YOU PLAY, NOT WITH A CLUB AND A TINY LITTLE BALL, BUT WITH A FUCKING FRIZBEE,your sport is stupid as shit. golfers at least have the sense to know their sport is stupid as well, and they seclude themselves from the rest of society in PRIVATE golf clubs. What do you guys do? You set up weird fucking metal chain nets in PUBLIC. PARKS.,!Crazy contraptions!, Get off the disc course. /asp/ was created for disc golf.,let's not use the word ""frisbee"" here.,Favorite discs:,Challys, Buzzzs, Rivers, Teebirds, Wraiths.,RHBH dominant.,Buzzz or Teebird, most likely,SHIGGYDIGGY.,Pleased to see that our thread is still alive; I'm gonna hit the course after work tonight with the intention of working on my sidearm. I'm a RHBH by nature, and my sidearm only comes out as a matter of necessity. Some shots are much more inclined to be thrown sidearm instead of risking the perfect turnover, so I figure I should nurture it and make it a bit more versatile. Any tips, or ""common mistakes"" a natively backhand player should be on the lookout for when you're trying to develop that ol' sidearm?,michigan discer here,god tier discs = katana, destroyer nuffsaid,Afternoon bump!,if by god tier you mean discs that most noobs will buy because they have big numbers and are fast/have cool pictures of robots on them,michigan here too,ever play cass benton? i know it's unlikely now that i think about it,And back to the front we go!,Managed to fit 18 in after work, the intent of practicing my sidearm was an absolute waste... I can't get a level release to save my life, everything left my hand at about a 20 degree angle. I'm guessing it's still considered ""hyzer"" when the release is tilted in cooperation with the disc's natural low-speed fade, yeah? ,The one time I managed to keep it flat was with a really understable disc; I figured if I was going to shank everything, I might as well use the right disc to compensate. It was all fine and well, but finally getting a decent release after trying to compensate with the disc just gave me a shitty unintentional roller.,I think I'll stick with backhand. :/,I can't sidearm either.. Going to play a round of 18 this afternoon. Hopefully my putting is on today.,My short game is the only thing that's been saving par lately. Nailed a couple 30+ foot putts last night, one hell of a confidence booster. If you don't have a portable basket to practice on, I highly recommend them. Made it a habit to practice 50 or so putts each evening, and it's really starting to pay off.,Yeah I have one, putting is all confidence. That repetition really does pay off. If I miss a putt early though, I miss a lot putts the entire round.. what do you putt with? And do you go for 75-100ft putts or do you just get up and down.,Right now I'm bouncing between a 170g Rhyno for windy days, and my trusty 160g Aero when it's a little calmer. The Rhyno still has a bit of a hook to it, but it can be blowing 30mph and it barely affects flight. Aero's on the opposite end of the spectrum, flies straight as hell but a breeze is enough to alter its path.,50 is about my max range for a serious ""go for it"" putt, anything past that is a jump putt. If it has a look at the basket at 75ft, cool, but I'm more concerned about a long come-back putt at that point.,I've been trying to work in some of those long bombs in my putting practice too. Not with the intention of hitting them all the time, but giving it a chance to go in while still bearing in mind to ""miss safe."",I'm still lucky if I sink even one in twenty from that range, but the longest miss I have now is under ten feet, and I'll take that any day, y'know? Besides, maybe it'll be that miraculous 1-in-20 shot that actually pays off on tournament day.,How would an ultimate player get into disc golf? There's a guy on my team who plays but his throws have insane distance that I just can't match, I've only been playing since about October.,First of all, you'll have to get some proper plastic. The discs used in DG are very different from those used in Ultimate or Freestyle. They tend to be a bit heavier and have a much different rim than a conventional frisbee.,Throwing technique is similar for a novice; the more you play, the more you'll refine your throw to accommodate the differing flight mechanics of golf discs as compared with freestyle discs.,Best advice I can give for a newbie is not to get too caught up in the performance ""stats"" for each disc out there. Try and steer away from discs that are referred to as ""overstable,"" since they generally require a little more power to throw properly. A good understable disc is (in my opinion) more conducive to the throwing style you'll be inclined to use being an ultimate player. ,Grab a putter as well, bit don't worry too much about 'midrange' discs. They'll eventually find a way into your arsenal, but I'm a big believer in developing form and consistency before you add in the variety.,Above all else, just get out and have fun! Tagging along with an experienced player might help in pointing out any obvious flaws in your technique, but remember that even a bad day on the course still beats a good day in the office!,Does the differing shape of golf discs allow them to fly further?,Thanks for all the advice, I'll see if I can join him next time.,yeah i love cass one of my favorites in michigan i live in the 586 area so i usually play stoney, firefighters and riverbends,i dont throw dx so no pictures on my plastic sorry and yes i do like fast discs should i be throwing t-rexs and firebirds??,throw what you can throw correctly.. like i cant throw a boss because i dont get it to its top speed so the flight isnt good,homer, ak,peter's creek, ak,Any Super Puppy lovers out there?,This, I'm a novice at the very most, but I got started out by going with a colleague and another friend, and I love it. Most guys who disc golf are ridiculously chill guys, so getting into it is really easy,Mornin', fellow DGers!,Just coming out for the customary daily bump; one handy tip I read a while back regarding putting: focus on a single chain link instead of the whole basket. If you aim at the whole target, a miss is still a miss, but if you're zoned in on just one spot, a narrow ""miss"" will still hole out.,Any handy advice on troubleshooting grip? I've been tinkering with my release angle, follow through, wind up, you name it... still don't have my old rip back. Only thing I haven't tried changing up it's my grip, but I've never had trouble throwing power with my fan grip before... what aspects am I overlooking here ?,I guess I'm not married to fan grip, if be willing to try something else, but :: don't know how to figure out where my grip is screwed up. Thoughts?,youtube disc golf monthly 94, dave feldberg gives some really good grip advice in that video, and good general form tips too,What's a good disc for sidearm throwing? I'm looking to get a new ones since my current arsenal is chewed up from all the trees I've hit over the years.,pic related, that one tree that always gets in your way whether you like it or not,I find that I still love the Discraft Avenger myself - on a calm day, if I've got a good whip of the wrist going, I can launch that thing in straight lines with no problems. It's pretty reliable on the sidearm as well. Windy though, it doesn't hold near as good a line... use the Beast.,I feel old. When I bought my bag, discs were only labeled as stable, understable, and overstable. Distance drivers, fairway drivers, approach, and putters. There were 3-4 manufacturers.,Buy 3 basic discs. Being an ultimate player, you could get away with 2 since disc golf putters are the closest to regular frisbees. You'd be able to milk the distance out of something you're familiar with. Once you have discs, get out to as many nearby courses as you can.,From there, you can branch out. Throw your friends discs, talk to other players. Never feel discouraged because you can't throw 400+. Learn control and accuracy.,You can purchase an Innova starter 3 pack (Leopard, Shark, Aviar) for ~$24. It gives you the driver, mid, and putter. All are great discs for beginners and I STILL use a leopard as one of my primary drivers to this day 10 years later.,god, i still love my leopards too. and my 2x champion leopard is perfectly broken in, the plastic feels so good.,I hate champion plastic. In my eyes it is only better on drives that would fuck up a disc if thrown straight into a tree. It's too wobbly/flexible for predictable flight.,DX plastic cuts the air better than all innova plastics. Pro is just as good, yet just as vulnerable to smacking right into a tree. Yes, it gets damaged when thrown into tree/ But for $7, it can be replaced. Buy two to trash and you have pro plastics.,oh yeah definitely thats why i throw katanas, destroyers and i should have mentioned nukes as well. i cant throw bosses or apes but i can launch a destroyer and i dont throw a anni shot either just long and straight then work the skip when it hyzers,I have to say, I am a huge fan of this sport. I've never understood why some people carry so many discs, though. I've worked up from a sidewinder to a beast to a star sl and now a star destroyer as my main backhand drivers along with a putter (first a dx aviar and now a super soft wizard) along with pic related which is beat as hell for turnovers and rollers. I am thinking about adding a nice midrange since I lost my shark a while ago, something like a star kite, but I see some people with at least 2 dozen discs walking around and they only throw three of them. Why do they do that?,forgot my pic related,No.,I carry maybe 6 or 7 different molds and then a couple of each mold. I guess the obvious answer is that we carry different discs for different shots.,i loled,but how many different shots are there really? shouldn't you be pretty much covered with a straight fairway driver a disc for hyzer shots and a turnover/roller disc with a putter?,2 warlocks - long putts/windy short putts,2 avairs - driving putters,3 buzzes - straight/OS/a brand new one,1 meteor - mid US,3 teebirds - driver US/straight/OS,2 wraiths - distance US/OS,1 firebird - wind and utility,1 monarchs - utility US driver,idk how to answer your question but thats my bag,My baggy,Echo * destroyer,2 bosses (beat and not),First run * teerex,CE eagle,* roadrunner,Kc pro roc,Warship,* classic roc,Polecat,BB aviar,Super puppy,200g zephyr & condor for funs,Nailed my first ace last year on a blind shorty annie. Any other acers in here?,Also bag list,Star Katana,Champion Beast x3,Star Destroyer,Star Roadrunner,Star Wraith,3 Buzz in ESP, Z, Cryzzzty,Star Coyote,Blizzard Destroyer,Blizzard Boss,Champion Sidewinder,Champion Valkyrie(super lite 150g),Champion Orc,Champion T-Bird(very broken in),New for me this year is the Star Lycan. won it in a bet gonna see how it flies.,i also carry an additional six or seven collectors discs for trade bait on the course. ,tl;dr i carry a bag full of shit and people stare at it. sometimes asking questions.,Millennium: Orion - Long Straight,Only disc I need.,Disc golf is the sport of stoners. Walking through some chill forest on a sunny day flickin' some discs. Bud break in the foliage for maximum performance. Sounds like a perfect day to me.,this is almost 100% accurate. but you know what, it's fun. and it still takes skill.,Bought:,Champion Rhyno,Champion Eagle,Found:,Star katana,Not sure lol don't remember:,Champion Beast,Champion Orc,i like the innova Katana star plastic as my driver...havent played in a while, really need to go,I'm the guy that originally asked, and I have to admit that Feldberg is my new friggin' hero. I had no idea that footwork could make such a huge difference, because I've also determined I was rounding discs really bad... When I got lucky and released back on the line, awesome shot, every other time when I was off the line, crap shot.,I was focused more on rotational momentum than shift momentum, and it's already made a big difference. After watching a few other clinics that Dave hosted, he's just so damned consistent with his shots that I take his word over damn near anyone else's at this point.,Fantastic info, and even if you weren't having problems like I was, seriously go watch that video. So much helpful advice!,From what I've read in this thread initially, most people here are pretty new/casual players.,Rule numero uno: no drivers. Seriously. The majority of players start off browsing the local big-box sports retailer, and end up with a warp-speed (9-13) driver. They see ""speed"" and immediately grab the disc with the highest number (and 4/5 times its one of these , disasters) because it must fly the farthest right? Wrong. These discs are intended to be thrown by top players that can absolutely bomb a disc (500-600'). You're not throwing the disc with anywhere near enough speed to get the intended flight.,""But I throw this wraith like 250' so I can throw high speed drivers"",No. Shut up. You would get just as much distance, with a lot more control and consistency with a slower disc. A slower disc will also reveal the flaws in your form so you can fix them, and increase your max D and control.,""Ok then what should I buy DG Guru?"",If you just want to get your feet wet in the DG world, one disc would be perfectly adequate. A mid-range will function well off the tee, and for putting. ,If you've been to a store that sells discs, you probably noticed the different plastics discs are made of. Because its the biggest company in DG and most readily available, I'll use Innova Discs as an example. In order of durability (and consequently price) their discs are produced in DX, Pro, Champion & Star plastic. The next biggest name in DG is Discraft. They have a similar line-up of plastics, again in order of price and durability, Elite-x, Pro-D, Elite-Z & ESP. There are other plastics produced by these companies, but these are the ones you'll see most common in the store.,CONT,Without getting too much into the details, the best disc for beginners from Innova would be a DX Roc. The Roc was one of the first golf discs produced by Innova, and you'd probably find a Roc of some sorts in 3/5 golfers bags today. And if you're looking for a Discraft equivalent, go with a Pro-D Buzzz (the Roc vs. Buzzz debate is one of the most discussed topics in the sport, so pick a side),As the disc gets used, you'll inevitably start smacking your beloved Roc into trees. Don't worry about it; this is a good thing. As the disc gets ""beat in"", its flight will change slightly. As a beginner, this is helpful because it helps you get familiar with how your disc flies and you'll be extremely comfortable with it. It's not uncommon for a player to carry 2-6 Rocs in a variety of plastics & various stages of ware to cover all their mid range duties.,Ok so you've got your Roc and you're kind into this disc golf thing. ""I can get one of those destroyers now right?"",No. Shut up. Buy a putter. ,Again, there are a million putters in a wide variety of plastics. Unlike mid ranges, putter choice is mostly a personal preference. It comes down to how it feels in your hand, and how it flies for you. ,Following the theme for the big two again, Innova's most popular putter is the Aviar (DX). You really can't go wrong with it as a first putter, and it's readily available too. Discrafts most popular putter is probably the Magnet (Pro-D). ,If you get a putter, and immediately hate it, try something else. It might take a couple years of playing before you find something that really clicks with you, and even then you might change your mind some more. ,Once you're comfortable with your putter and mid range, and can get a drive out to 250-300', then you can start exploring drivers. Some great choices for newer players include:,Innova: eagle, teebird, gazelle & leopard,Discraft: stalker, zombee, cyclone & XL,CONT,If you've got a collection of discs, and want to explore some other companies, there are a plethora of smaller companies that produce awesome equipment: Discmania, Dynamic Discs, Gateway, Latitude 64, Legacy, Millennium, MVP, Prodigy, Vibram, & Westside. There are a ton of options.,Most importantly, go out and play. Convince your friends to buy a couple discs. It's a fun and cheap activity that gets you a little exercise. It's more fun learning with other people, and helping each other along the way too. ,Resources:,for finding courses & an active forum community: dgcoursereview.com,online flight guides: marshallstreetdiscgolf.com/media/fl,here,This too. A Saturday afternoon in the sun, with a bowl and a few brews with some friends is the definition of nirvana.,Figured I'd post what I throw too (even though it changes often depending on the course and conditions):,Drivers:,Z Predator,P-line PD,MVP Volt ,Z Avenger SS,Champ Eagle,Opto River,Pro Leopard,Mid Range:,DX Roc (x2),KC Pro Roc,Esp Comet,Z Comet,ESP Zone,Putters,Vibram Ridge,Esp(flx) Challenger,I'm really glad moot created this board. It's more likely to be discussion on participating in sports, as opposed to watching them, which is what /sp/ has become.,Good read for a beginner. Do you recommend focusing on a few molds, so you know them very well? For instance, I carry the same molds but they all fly a little bit differently and are used for different shots.,oops quoted the wrong post,Great question.,There are two schools of thought. ,The first being like you said. Limit the molds, and get to know them in and out. A popular route to take as an example (with Innova molds) would be 2-4 destroyers for distance, 2-4 eagles for fairway duties, 3-4 Rocs for mid range, and 2-3 Aviars for putting and approach. Probably 2-5 discs used to fill in the gaps and for utility duty.,The other route, which is what myself and a lot of other people do: different molds to cover different shots. You are going to want to make sure to invest in premium plastic (star/champ) so that the flight of your discs change as little as possible.,There's not a right and wrong way to do it, but I've noticed a lot of the top players will go with the first technique. I'm starting to lean towards this as well, so I guess I'll see how it works out for me.,I read all the instructional posts in this voice,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOa,Haha that's not me, but I'm flattered to be mistaken for him. that dude makes some really good videos. I believe he goes by MikeC on the DGCR forums. ,Does a nice job explaining some grip and technique basics. And he is a testament to the fact that you don't need a huge run up to throw bombs. ,Smooth motion and timing with a SNAP at the release. ,And I can totally see where you're coming from with the marketing campaign haha (for MVP I assume you're referring to). If MVP sponsored anyone, it should be Mike. He has some great videos highlighting the entire MVP lineup.,this damnable course...,holy shit, a disc golf thread. i sell plastic for a living and would love to anonymously share that the industry really is owned and operated by stoners. we keep it low-key because of the stigma of ""hurting the sport"", but the management and staff at these companies are all pro-marijuana.,was looking to start a DG thread and found this. just picked up a 172g valkyrie today. white disc gold font... so majestic, can't wait to bomb it (snowing in jersey so gonna have to wait a few days),My Bag:,Fly-Dye Nuke,Champion Dye Avenger (american flag... oh yeah),DX Wraith,Good ol' Starter Pack Leopard,Buzzzz,Wizard,Starter Pack Aviar,Also have a few others I don't use at all or have just found in the woods.,It's so much fun to pick up some new plastic and see if you like it, every disc can be so different. I'm lucky enough to have a course 3 minutes from my house, so as soon as it was built, I got hooked!,This isn't surprising at all. It's basically implied that if you play DG, you're most likely smoking weed.,Just curious; when you say you sell plastic, do you represent a manufacturer or do you operate a shop?,Yeah I think it's a combination of willingness to make peanuts, plus I mean, who gets so deep into disc that it becomes a career? ,Personally I keep my work persona clean of green because it's just one facet of all the ways people enjoy DG and I'm not out to push any one as more valid than the other. Plus stoner radar will bring together the reps and pros who can't be seen toking in public. I do, sadly, have to be discreet on the course now. ,It's a small world... a little of everything. ,Tell ya who I DON'T represent is Prodigy; top-down pure incompetence ... already low on cash.. why do you think they haven't launched a decent supply? Innova does significantly dumber more infuriating shit than Discraft. Lat64 is about to conquer the US srsly.,From a consumer standpoint, I tend to prefer Innova if for no other reason, their disc ratings are more meaningful to me as a player. For physical plastic, I honestly prefer DC's ESP blend, but the single number they use to class their discs leaves me a bit in the dark. It gives a good overall impression of stability, but you lose some of the nuance that Innova provides with their four-stat system. ,Don't get me wrong, I carry a lot of different names in my bag, but I have to give them the nod on marketing at least.,At the same time, industry impressions are often wildly distant from consumer impressions, so I'm not surprised they're frustrating to work with; half the vendors I rep in electronics are, really, crap companies that happen to make outstanding products.,Anyone here ever play up at the redwood curtain?,Yup, I think demystifying the disc via ratings, explanation, graphics, etc is the way of the future in marketing discs. There's too fucking many of them... people can't keep things straight.,I think inbounds' inflight guide is doing a great job of this.,Yeah; I mean, sure, there's something to be said for the excitement of snatching a new disc and seeing how it flies on that first toss, but at fifteen+ bucks a pop, it's tough to justify an impulse purchase that may or may not earn a spot in my bag. I really don't know much about Latitude, but I just picked up a couple off of recommendation. Sadly, fist impressions still count for a lot with me, so if this gamble doesn't pay off and they aren't what I expect, I'll be a lot more hesitant in the future. It's something that a lot of manufacturers can pick up from Innova; regardless of how you feel about the product, it's outstandingly well-marketed.,Don't similarly misunderstand me that I'm saying their system is the defacto standard, it just happens to be the only one I've personally seen that tells me everything I need to know about expected flight without ever having it in my hand.,I've seen several in-store promo displays with useful comparative graphics, charts, you name it; I'd really like to see those become the standard as opposed to the exception.,Couldn't agree more about the greens. There's a time and place for everything and I don't allow my hobbies, legal and otherwise, interfere with my work.,As a pure consumer, it's really cool to hear the perspective of someone who communicates and deals with the manufacturers regularly. Mind disclosing where you're from? (even a general area would be cool, but based on your manufacturer or shop answer, my guess would be SE Michigan),In my opinion, Prodigy is going to be a disaster. All those pros abandoned their sponsors because they thought they could make more money by producing their own equipment. I highly doubt one of those idiots has as any business, engineering, or marketing experience, and I wouldn't be surprised if none of them had a degree at all.,I didn't jump on the bandwagon. The fact that they've been selling plastic for less than 6 months, and have already lost money after the initial hype, leads me to believe they might not make it a year. I'll be laughing at them as they beg Innova and Discraft to take them back.,Innova needs to chill out with all the drivers they release, and with new releases at all. They need to axe a few molds before they come out with anything new. Yes. It might not make some people happy because you made their favorite mold OOP, but Innova most likely has a disc very similar to that one you can pick up and not notice a difference.,Latitude is quickly becoming one of my favorite manufacturers. They appear to be trying to corner the experienced player market by limited the molds they produce, which ensures their quality remains top notch. They also sponsor two of my favorite pros, Feldberg and Barsby.,I'd like to see the industry as a whole exploring different blends of plastic. I think we've make just about every combination of top, bottom, and rim mold possible. Explore some revolutionary materials for christs sake.,Innova has been the gold standard, and always will be. That's why when you ask someone ""how does blah blah fly"", they'll answer ""oh thats like a teebird"" or ""pretty much a roc"" and things of the like.,New companies are constantly trying new things, but eventually end up producing replicas of Innova molds.,AND I STILL USE IT, Champion Orc,I like to think disc karma exists... Just played a tourney this last weekend, and lost a well-broken-in Valk in the process. Happened to find a nearly-new Wraith when I went back to look for it on Monday, sadly it was named / numbered, and I can't, in good conscience, not call.,Turns out that it belonged to a pretty cool fella, we got along pretty well and played a quick nine holes since we met at the course. Sadly, my Valk is still MIA, but he's a more experienced player than I am and was more than happy to give me some pointers that helped out with holding a line on my drives, etc. Definitely a worthy trade in my eyes, the tips he helped me out with are probably more useful than any disc I could have recovered!,If thats true, I'm due to hit the motherload haha. I haven't found shit and I've probably lost 10.,Beautiful day out today, but everything's going high and right, can't throw 'em low and fast like I used to... just gotta find that rhythm again I guess.,Are you lefty backhand or righty sidearm?,Backhand fix:,Keep your weight forward. You have the most potential when your leading shoulder is directly over your leading hip directly over your plant foot. Explode out of there with your arm whipping forward tight across mid-upper chest. ,If your backhand is going high and diving, you've got too much hip-to-chest upward diagonal in your throw. Bring it through on a rail, but remember you don't have to reach way back to explode forward; that's only for momentum, which you can far exceed with the power of a legs-thru-hips push into rotation. ,Sidearm fix:,You may be kicking your wrist. It's an extra push right at release. It seems natural... whip your shoulder hinge, thru your elbow hinge, thru your wrist hinge... why not push your fingers forward on release for the extra oomph? Well this either puts your shit way off-axis and it flips over (this is basically how the average thrower achieves control, though limited, with their sidearms) OR you do it differently and instead of keeping a flat palm, you kick your fingers upward and usually with some forced hyzer. ,If your sidearms are rising into a hard fade, you've got some stage of your throw where you're forcing the leading edge / nose upward. ,Formfag reporting,Well, I'm sure you're correct in that it's *something* related to my form; since I've pretty much got a clan skate to work with where muscle memory is concerned, I'm trying to change up my form after a 3 year break from the game.,Before I hung up the guns, I was using a scissor step run up. Nothing too special, just right - step behind left - right pivot. Since that wasn't doing the trick when I came back to the sport, figured I'd use a more contemporary X step run up and incorporate the hop. Mixed results at this point, but every so often I'll nail the release, so i know it's possible, just gotta work on consistency. My problem isn't conceptual, because I know to get the weight shift, keep the disc on a straight / hyzer / anhyzer line for both flight and approach depending on the shot, and pivot on the heel as opposed to the toe (Thanks Feldberg!) So in theory, I know what I should be doing, it's just hard to diagnose where the mechanics of my throw aren't following those recommendations. What I really OUGHT to do is set up a camera and record my form, because I'm sure I could tell what part I'm screwing up if I could see myself do it, just tough to get that kind of perspective without the third-person POV.,I'll give your recommendations a try and pay extra attention to upper body placement though. One bad habit that I did finally manage to notice was that even on straight shots, my arm was still swinging down and back up more like a pendulum; not excessively so, but enough that the added vertical momentum was making the disc sail on me. Fingers crossed, I think I've got that one addressed now that I've identified it, but it might still be sneaking in. ,Any other explanations for a throw that goes further right than the intended line? I started having the issue when I was rounding my shots instead of keeping them ""on a rail"" like you mentioned, but even after trying to be more mindful of keeping it on a single vector, it's still a little too right!,Just slow down your run up. Three steps and if you're right handed, follow through with your left elbow pointed at thetarget.,I just want summer now so I can go and throw my discs ;_____; one of the many downsides of having winter for half of the year,So guys,,I've noticed that I seem to drive better(farther) with my slower disks (TL, Sidewinder) than my faster disks (boss, nuke),I'm really trying to push for some more distance, I can only bang out 250-325' throws consistently with my lighter, slower disks.,I notice that when I start to put a lot of power on the disk, it starts to turn over (right, rhbh) more, most notably with my sidewinder and valkyrie. I can throw my Meteor as far, or further than most of my high speed drivers, even from a standing position.,coincidentally my faster disks are closer to max weight (173, 175) and my slower disks are medium (167, 165),I'm not sure if I should try faster disks with a lighter weight, if the faster disks are too sensitive for my neanderthal, noob status form, or if I need to change my approach to driving in general.,my bag:,2x Wizard (hard, medium) 175g,Discmania Fiend 174g,Discraft ESP Meteor 178g,Innova DX Kite 145g,Innova DX Viper 174g,Innova Champ. Leopard, 174g,Innova Star TL 167g,Innova Champ. Sidewinder 165g,Innova Ec. Star Valkyrie 175g,Innova Star Wraith 172g,Innova Ec. Star Boss 175g,Innova R-Pro Boss 150g,Discraft Glo Nuke 174g,I only really throw the faster disks forehand because I can't get enough distance backhand unless I'm throwing downhill.,You may be twisting your wrist or leaning backwards when you throw. ,I have a friend who would sometimes lean back as he pulls the disk across his body to throw, would usually cause him to have an anhyzer line with a flat disk.,I've been known to twist my wrist a little bit, changing the nose angle of the disk before release.. could also contribute to a similar problem.,Unless I'm completely misunderstanding what you're describing.,Drop the the bosses, nukes, wraiths, and all the other fast discs. There's no point in throwing them if you can't get them to their top speed. You'll just lose more control on your throws by throwing them. Focus on your form right now. Try to not strong arm your throws etc etc. And go ahead and read this guy's post,anyone in se mich wanna play some disc golf? its kinda warming up now.,dgcoursereview is a great site for finding courses.,You'd benefit from dropping the high speed drivers in your bag if you're not throwing over 325.,Also, a lot of your discs overlap.,I'd narrow your bag down to the following:,2x Wizard (hard, medium) 175g,Discmania Fiend 174g,Discraft ESP Meteor 178g,Innova DX Viper 174g,Innova Champ. Leopard, 174g,Innova Ec. Star Valkyrie 175g,Then you should add a slightly stable driver (eagle, teebird, stalker) and a slightly stable midrange (roc, buzzz).,Check out this chart. ,marshallstreetdiscgolf.com/media/fl,anybody got any CE plastic they want to get rid of ? :),I keep them in my bag but I don't throw them often. Usually its for a specific shot, or for a RHFH where I can actually get them flying fast enough.,I know a lot of my discs overlap, but most of them were freebies or discs I found and nobody called back on. The Fiend, Viper, Leopard, Valk, Echo Boss come to mind. The r pro boss is a dedicated thumber/tomahawk disk because I destroyed it the first time I used it.,My meteor is a stable/slightly overstable midrange that I put out to 250-300 feet regularly. I also have no problem throwing my putters and fiend 150-200',I had a Teebird, I might pick up another one, but I do currently use a TL, which is pretty similar. ,To me, it seems like I throw my slower disks more consistently as a whole. I can drive most of my 'slow' disks at least 150-250 feet consistently, but anything 'fast' I have a hard time going much further AND my accuracy suffers due to inconsistency. That's why I was wondering if going LIGHTER would help me put enough speed/snap on my high speed drivers.,I will take these recommendations into consideration guys.,No, but I have a hard time finding champion plastic in those neon colors. My sidewinder is that color and it practically glows in the dark, Its almost impossible to lose,Meant to say the meteor is slightly under-stable,For drivers, yes a lighter weight will generally get you more distance, but you'll be sacrificing control and wind resistance.,Lightest I'd go would be 167-170. You should stay away from blizzard plastic. Big waste of money IMO,no ones posted iron leaf yet?,you dg'rs seen this one?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9,Dude does a great impression. My friends and I used to use the term Ironwood Branch all the time to describe the same stuff. There's one at Pier Park, hole 10 or 11?, this stupid fucking tree just dangles down in the way of a dogleg left UP and OVER a hill. You pretty much have to throw it right below or between branches to get a birdie, and guaranteed every round we will have one person hit that fucker, disk thrown straight into the dirt. We call this ""the rule of trees"", a parody of the rule of threes.,As far as plastic goes, I've been here and there, I have gateway, innova, discmania, lattitude, discraft, all kinds of stuff. I don't have any brand loyalty, I just play with what I find or what I choose to try.,My favorite plastic is probably the Discraft ESP and Innova Champion, but I've really liked the Echo Star lately it seems very similar to the ESP plastic from discraft.,I agree on the run up/scissor/x step. It throws my game off. I was getting so pissed about throwing my meteor 250~ feet standing still but barely throwing my TL further with a cross step. I went several months throwing nothing but my Meteor, I fucking love that disk.,Personally, I want to throw farther to get around obstacles. If I could put another 50-75 feet on my drive I could avoid alot of annoying hazards that I otherwise may send my disk careening into.,What recommendations do you guys have for my bag in terms of drivers? Right now im carrying stalkers, leopards, and firebirds. I can throw them like 325'. im thinking maybe a roadrunner,Well, I managed to fit in a round and a half after work tonight, and I think you're probably onto something with what you mentioned. My issue wasn't that I was leaning BACK, per se, but I noticed that just like ,, I was throwing better with my slower discs.,I got so damned frustrated with everything that at one point, I did my usual run-up and FROZE when I'd normally release. Aside from the fact that I have no sense of balance and nearly killed myself trying to come to a dead stop, I found that I was actually off-balance to the right. In the process of trying to pull the disc straight across my chest instead of rounding it off, I was somehow managing to lean right from the waist at the point of release.,After realizing that, summarily trying to correct for it and stay more centered during the throw, it just doesn't feel right. I guess it just illustrates the point that you can study 'proper' form day in and day out, but at the end of the day, you've gotta find what works for you.,After the first round, and plenty of frustration, I had enough daylight to give the front nine another go. I kinda threw everything I've been absorbing regarding 'proper form' out the window and went with what felt comfortable... Results were mediocre, but consistent. I never managed to really crush any drives like I occasionally could when I was trying to be technically correct, I'd say my 'comfortable form' drives fell in the 250' - 300' window. By contrast, when I was trying to emulate the pros and keep my form to a T, I was rolling the dice on getting a good shot. Very inconsistent, they'd land anywhere in the 200' - 400' range. When the stars aligned and I had a solid release and follow-through, I could count on getting a good 350' off the tee... But that was pretty rare. More often than not, I'd end up shanking it one way or the other and was doing good to get 250 out of it. Really leaves me at a loss as to which direction to pursue, y'know?,roadrunner and sidewinder are similar to firebirds and leos tho. same with monarchs and teebirds. those are all mid-drivers.,the next step up would be wraith, TL or starfire.,then above that is boss, destroyer, katana, ape.,Are you looking for something faster, or just to fill out your bag?,A roadrunner would be good, or a monarch for something a tad faster.,You seem to have everything but the extreme under/overstable covered.,nah, not looking for more speed. Just looking to fill my bag with different stabilitys. And my firebird is pretty damn overstable,I'll reveal one of my disc golf sins here, but I recently picked up a Katana... I know that technically, it's too fast of a disc for my arm; I'm not disputing that fact. But I confess that I've fallen in love with that mold. Even with me underpowering it, it's one of those discs that I can ""play the curve"" with, and a little anhyzer touch on it gives it a really reliable s-curve.,It *should* finish right of your line even after it fades out, but it finishes damn near on the line with the power I'm throwing it at, and playing that S gives it an easy 50+ feet over the drivers that are in line with my throw power. So what if it's too fast, I'm just gonna keep telling myself I'll grow into it, and that makes everything okay!,Don't worry too much about distance. Work on your accuracy and control, and distance will come with time once you have your form locked down.,If you can park holes <300', they you'll shoot under par on 90% of courses.,Coincidentally, I posted both of those. lol.,When my friend does the 'lean' its usually because he's trying to throw it too hard. Its very much a balance thing. There were two things that helped him improve from this:,He tried getting his torso 'over' the disk more when he threw. This prevented him from leaning too far back when he would whip it past his chest. Sounds like you tried this.,He also tried adjusting the angle of release when 'leaning', so the disk would still release flat (or per your intention) while keeping his form.,Ideally, its all about what works for you. You can make foreign concepts more comfortable by repetition. All isn't necessarily lost, it just might feel funny for a while.,It sounds like you're trying to put too much power down with an unfamiliar form, leading to inconsistencies. I've noticed that the flight of your disk is dictated very much by the movement/direction of your shoulders and hips.,Try applying the adjustments to your form one at a time, with slower/easier disks. Take a couple practice swings/walk ups, take your time and think about the shot, it really helps put it together. Maybe you don't need to take ALL of the form from the pros, but a piece here or there might really help your game.,I'd throw a Sidewinder, but they don't turn right as much as an Archangel or Roadrunner.,If you're looking for something slightly understable, try an Innova TL.,slightly overstable you could try an Innova Eagle.,If you're looking for something stable with more distance, try an SL. its a speed 10 but it has lots of glide and doesn't turn much or fade much.,I've got a little more time on my hands now, bored stiff at work, and all I can think about is getting back out on the course... I'll throw some more ""first impressions"" from the other plastic I got along with that Katana, which as you probably guessed, I'm still fawning over.,Champion Tern: Innova's recent addition to their already exhaustive driver selection. Maybe it's more special-purpose than I'm giving it credit for, but it seems like another superfluous mold to me. Nothing about it really stuck with me, but also bear in mind that I'm a low/mid power thrower, so your results may vary if you can throw speed 13+ molds properly. I'll give it another shot once I develop the appropriate power, but until then, it's not in my bag.,Star Destroyer: Another disc I picked up that's too fast for my current arm, but I needed another ""utility"" disc for sweeping right-to-left holes, as my home course has a number of them. I won't throw it that often, but I've had Destroyers before and already knew it was too much disc, just wanted another to fill in the ""extreme overstable"" gap in my bag.,??? Xpress: Not sure what plastic blend this guy is; Custom dye job, so the original stamp is obscured. It's marketed as understable, and I was really hoping for something that still had enough fade that I could throw a hyzer flip straight down any narrow fairways or tree tunnels. A little more flippy than I had anticipated, it still finishes right and doesn't have a whole lot of natural fade. If I throw it flat, it turns over and fades back to about level, but its saving grace is that it does have an awful lot of glide, so it might up being a solid go-to disc for tailwind.,Starlite Valkyrie: It's always windy here, but my buddy has a sickening love for the Valkyrie mold. He's got virtually every other type of Valk under the sun, so I figured I'd just pick this up to round out his collection. At a puny 130g, I wasn't surprised when the wind took it and ran, still a novelty.,[Cont.],Ti Nuke: I've heard a lot of good things about Nukes, so I figured I'd try one for myself. I don't know if the Ti blend makes the disc more naturally overstable, but it had a lot more fade than what I expected. It was always my impression that the Nuke was meant for mid-to-high power players, so I expected to underpower it by a small margin at first, assuming that like others, I'd grow into it. Not necessarily the case, in my experience. I'll continue giving it a try, but I'm wondering if the Nuke SS would have been a better fit for me; SS series divers are a bit more understable than the original molds, correct?,Lat64 Striker: Another impulse buy, I have a pretty favorable view of this little fella. I only put it downrange a couple times, since I was more interested in trying out the Tern and Nuke, but it felt like a solid flight leaving my hand. I'm definitely going to incorporate this more seriously my next couple trips out to the course and can develop a more serious opinion about it. First impressions still count for a lot, though, and I'm definitely intrigued to see how Latitude fares in the future. If it's good enough to pique my curiosity after just a handful of tosses, they gotta be doing something right.,This x 100. Took my a year to figure this out myself and another two years to ""fix"" my form problems related to my rocky start I am a serious player and put as much time into this as I can. I am glad this thread exists, hopefully we can spread some knowledge to help make the game less frustrating and more fun.,There are a few great sites already listed here to help, and I HIGHLY recommend video taping yourself throwing and comparing to a Pro to see the differences. Remember, you do not have to rip the disc as hard as you can to get it to fly 400+ ft. It is about control and timing.,Any rhyno lovers out here?,My go-to putter on windy days. Great disc,Had one as my first putter. I had a hard time controlling it beyond 40 feet. Gave it to a friend and went to a Soft Wizard for a while. Eventually, I found the control I needed in a lighter DX Aviar.,The Rhino didn't work for me, but I liked how it felt in the hand.,It's about the only one I use lately, winds are still maddening around here, and my Rhyno (174g) is about the only thing that remains reliable through gusty conditions. For the longest time I used an Aero, and still occasionally throw it on the calmer days, but I just can't trust it anywhere above 15mph winds.,Well, it's me again, same guy that just can't seem to get consistent distance on the tee. Tried a few more subtle tweaks, but nothing that's really paying dividends. I think I've still just got too many bad habits that snuck into my technique, and it's turning out to be one hell of an ordeal to fight routine tendencies.,A few other questions I've formed after another round and some extra driving practice:,-On the memorable drives where the hit really feels spot-on and the distance pans out accurately, it rips over my index finger. If I manage a few of those in a row, it actually tends to numb. As far as the shot goes, I'm pretty satisfied when that happens, but is there any insight on top of that? Is that indicative of something I'm doing well or poorly, or is it a relatively indifferent thing? I'm not super concerned about it, but I figure it's worth mentioning in case that's a common occurrence with an improper grip or shoddy release.,-Regarding form check on my pull-through, about what relative heights should I be on the lookout for? My best guess up to this point has been shoulder-height for throwing ani, sternum for straight, belly button for hyzer. Are those reasonable enough estimates for me to work with, or should it be determined by reachback angle instead of reachback height?,-Posture! While it's a given that you don't want to be stiff as a board on your throw, how should you be positioning your upper body through the hit? We've already addressed earlier in the thread that your center of gravity should be above your plant foot, but should you strive to remain as tall & upright as you can without becoming overly rigid?,-Traded in one problem for another; everything WAS finishing right of target when I started my little quest for relearning proper form, whereas after some of my tweaks, things are releasing too early and starting further left than the intended line. Is this a sign that I'm still rounding off the throw? Any other possible factors?,Really like the ""homie"" stamped one.,Are those all champ or what?,The disc thread is picking up steam! ,Anyhow, I'm super curious about this prodigy talk. I happen to live and play in the same city of a big prodigy player. I'm def skeptical.,I have this to say about Prodigy; I really think they should have gone about their PR a little different and let the internet do most of the hyping instead of doing it themselves. That being said, they are making improvements. As with any manufacturer, they are still learning and testing so I would try the discs before throwing out the ban hammer. ,The D1 and D4 are great drivers IMO. Go with the First Runs obviously. People get upset when the Protos don't fly like they think it should. It is called a Prototype for a reason.... ,I can't wait to try the putters and fairway drivers. Those are my favorites anyways. I have a source (sounds lame I know) that says at least one of the putters is going to be very Gateway Magic like. I think that is a great move. If they make it in their current plastic, I will be very pleased. ,So, overall, they a ways to go. They are new and just want to survive, but they still could have done better. I love the feel of their plastic and I have played with Phil Arthur enough times to know he really cares about the products but is just very new to this aspect of the game. In the meantime, I am constructing an MVP bag. Neat discs, give'em a look.,I'm interested to see their other plastic materials.,The ""450 series"" or whatever the stuff they're making discs in now is alright for drivers, but I like to be able to beat in my mid ranges and putters.,Get their shitty naming convention right! lol,Tell Phil there's more to it than fucking dreaming and making grand proclamations.",ADVICE FOR NEW

"It doesn't feel like Wrestlemania season. Normally around this time I get real excited for at least one match on the show but not this year. Maybe it's because every major match is a rematch or maybe it's just poorly booked is anyone in the same boat with me? I mean not even Taker Vs Punk is enough to get me to buy this show.,Right there with ya pal.,At least last year I was pretty excited for Rock/Cena and Punk/Jericho.,I genuinely don't care to see any of the rematches in the main event, and as much as I'm sure Punk/Taker will be a solid match, we all know Punk will lose so who gives a shit.,Not even the under-card is exciting at least there were a couple of matches in the past years that made up for it and like you said last year the Punk Vs Jericho match had me excited to buy the show but this mania just feels thrown together like no thought process was put into it.,I'm not as hyped this year, because 2/3 of the main events are fucking rematches. Even with Punk/Taker, It's probably 90% Taker winning it. Other than that, I'm not even remotely excited about the under card, other than maybe seeing The Shield making their WM debut.,Rematches are fine if built up properly and something fans actually want to see. Unfortunately, I don't think anybody really wanted to see twice in a lifetime.,You aren't excited to finnaly see Fandango wrestle?!,It'll be nice but we already know who is going to win. And that's honestly the problem with most of the matches on the card. It was kind of like this last year. It's almost like we're too smart for our own good. We have everything figured out and we're all waiting/hoping for some swerves which we probably even get.,I hope Fandango and his girl get to do a 5 minute dance routine before the match,The biggest problems with these rematches are that they involve part timers. Lesnar and Haitch is a waste of a card spot. I wasn't interested at Summer Slam, and I'm not interested now. And now they have this moronic stipulation. ,Use those guys to help launch new talent. Would you rather see Lesnar vs Haitch AGAIN or something different like Lesnar vs Ryback? Even with Jericho, I love that they're using him to push talent, but they need to get a high mid card guy like Barrett or Cesaro and push them into main event tier.,Thanks for reminding me of that horrid Fat Hardy storyline where he's losing weight to be eligible for that title. ,hey that was a good storyline man. matt, tajiri, rey, all those guys in their prime. Smackdown cruiserweight division was top notch.,Matt Hardy suddenly losing strength and falling to the ground was stupid as hell.,I thought it was funny shit. Version 1 Matt Hardy was the best. He can slap a tomato,I'd rather the Hardcore title come back..slap on the 24/7 rule. Give the jobbers something to do. Something ANYTHING besides us getting recap after recap. I don't even care if Divas get involved.,I think DDT did a better version of the 24/7 hardcore title.,Based ladder as champion being screwed.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAn4,The only match I even care about a little is Punk vs. Taker and with Punk going in hurt and Taker being old, it could suck.,Everything else is so last minute slapped together it's not even funny. And then they want five or ten bucks more for the show this year, give me a break.,I agree, Lesnar/HHH is the biggest waste of time on the card. But you know it's going to get the time it needs i.e. 20-30 minutes. And now that we have ten matches on the card AND a P. Diddy performance, it's just gonna smush everything else to nothing. I mean, why even do the show like this? It's not even worth it.,Honestly, the 24/7 Hardcore Title would do wonders for the company, especially with this social networking stuff they're doing. title changes via tout, twitter feuds, etc. etc.,Agree with every word, OP.,I figure the problem's that triple main event. Wrestlemania's meant to be the place where stars are born and history is made. And instead of immortalizing a new main eventer or building towards the future of the company or even so much as doing something fresh, we're getting... this. It's not just that it's all rehashes. It's not just that it's all rehashes involving stars from 10 years ago instead of stars of tomorrow. It's all rehashes, involving stars from 10 years ago, wherein all of the WRONG guys are clearly going to go over.,WWE could benefit so much from Brock becoming the new top monster heel by retiring Haitch, or Punk getting the massive rub since he's carrying the company for those other 11 months of the year and could use the heat, or Rock putting over someone, ANYONE other than the stale top star no-one wants to see win anymore. And yet, you just know that HHH is going to spite Brock and never appear again anyway, Taker's going to add a completely meaningless notch to his bloated streak, and CENAWINSLOL with a vengeance. This booking isn't even running in place; it's positively wanking off the past because, hey, fuck change amirite?,I feel like it is on par with the last few years. However I am still riding the high that is having my 12 year dream come true as I am going to be there live, so anything less than a 4 hours Cena promo is good enough for me,WWE,Booking identical matches to last year,Everybody begins to second guess them thinking they must have a twist up their sleeve,Anticipation buile,No plot twist or heel turns ........ that was the twist,Oh WWE,I'm looking forward to the Tag Team match since that can go either way and both teams have good wrestlers in them. I'm also hoping Ziggler cashes it in. If Shamoose does the heel turn instead of Orton, it would be great.,Probably the worst build up to a Taker match since I've been watching.,It's sad because it had the potential to be one of the best matches as well.,What the fuck is everyones problem? ,pretty sure there are only 2 rematches. and HHH v Brock wasn't at WM last year.,how could you not be interested in this Punk Taker feud after Paul Bearer's death, all of these feels. ,Swaggie v Del RIIOOOOO is the best world heavyweight championship match we've had in months. ,The sheild and their match will be an amazing spot fest. ,Ryback v Henry will be neat, i think they might try to pull off some crazy shit here. ,And after seeing Fandango's flying leg drop on Monday I am ready for more. the guy CAN wrestle and his match will Jerico will be awesome. ,Other than the card there's a lot of other things that make wm29 still and attractive buy:,no gay angle involving some no name celebrity ,or at least some botched attempt again. ,it's time.,orton wants this so bad. ,have no fear this will be a top WM,You're a funny guy.,Because his death isn't helping the build-up, really. Punk, in no way, has been developed correctly to be a believable foe -- kind of expect that when you only take a fucking month to write the thing.,Ugh. Spam.,are you kidding me? he gets legit heat everytime he comes out, only angsty smarks still cheer for him.,hahaha stay delusional,outside of your ""smark"" bubble i am betting 90% of fans are hyped for the rematch,Heh, nobody blames you OP. This Mania has been poorly built up. Maybe one of the worst Road to Wrestlemania build up I've ever seen.,Ever segment for the big name matches are boring, repetitive and tedious. With no flair or anything to make you want either guy to pull out ahead and all the other matches get so little build up you can hardly care for them because you have no idea why you should even care.,Funnily enough, the cards actually kind of okay, WWE really just dropped the ball on the setting the stage part.,I don't care about the rest of the card except for The Shield. Johnny Ace should have a sponsored match maybe against Vickie Guerrero or Booker T,Ryback & Shield only gained prominence in the last few months, Cena was in that retarded soap opera storyline with AJ, the only true wrestling angles had Punk, Beeg & Sheamus as the frontrunners.,Yeah, I think the card has looked okay, but too much of the build-up feels like it's last minute. It's like they decided to just get everyone on the card, but forgot to explain why.,I miss the lack of a specialty matches at Wrestlemania. No longer do we see matches like TLC,Casket,Buried Alive,IronMan,2 out of 3 falls,3 stages of Hell,etc.,The closest we have to that this year is the no holds barred retirement match,and its a repeat from Summer Slam.,They're the main events.,Swaggie should have been put down a notch after that whole weed the people thing.,That's because they took every match with an interesting gimmick and gave it its own pay per view,I honestly think Raw if not WWE as a whole would be better if there were only 6 or 7 PPVs a year. I'm thinking the main four, MITB, bring back King of the Ring, and.. I dunno, I kinda like EC, though you should move that up instead of having it before WM..,Agreed. Bring back some of the classic PPV's,King of the Ring,In Your House,Judgement Day.It Might peak the interest of former fans to give it a try again.Also maybe test out a Attitude Era themed ppv along the lines of One Night Stand 05 and with only the appropriate wrestlers and gimmicks for that period,cash in on the current nostalgia.One a year wouldn't hurt.,That's what I'm looking forward to. ,And who else thinks that Ziggy and Ryblack will win the titles? And AJ will win the womens strap too. I think I see where WWE is going with all this.,Remember at the beginning of the year in an interview Ziggler said that he wanted to Unify the belts this year? WWE wouldn't just have him say some shit like that and then toss it. It's happening.,All I'm pissed about is the midcard belts. We've seen Barret/Miz at least 300 times. Hell, we saw it THIS MONDAY. Why not give Barret/Cesaro some good athletic feuds like in the good old days?,Unify it into what exactly?,I mean it'd work if it was the WHC and WWE championship.,But what exactly does the Tag Team title bring? Besides it's not a singles title, if he unifies it that takes the belt off Ryblack.,Doesn't make any sense.,I think he's trying to imply Ziggy, Soulberg, and CrayJ are going to take every title on their shows like evolution did back in the day.,That's what I meant. In that interview he said he would win both the WHC and WWE strap and unify them. He DID lose the Rumble so obviously things aren't moving along, but I'd say in the future it just might happen, with the brands being unified and all. ,I just feel like Ziggler isn't being built up right. He could have done all this already but having him constantly job and lose isn't really making him look credible. Even if he pulls out that WHC win, he will just look weak as hell because hes been jobbing for months now.,I suppose if it got Orton and Batista over, it could do the same for Ryblack, but Trips and Flair knew how to get people over as heels, Ziggler can't even get himself over. Putting all the belts on them runs the risk of getting Ryblack, Ziggler and CrayJ X-Pac Heat.,Yeah, I don't even see him winning the WHC, I feel like they're setting him up to head back to the midcard, like they put it on him and decided to take it back.,I feel like Swaggie's going to win, Ziggles(after a Tag Team win.) will come out try to cash. Zeb or somebody interferes, he'll lose his opportunity and Delrito can go onto his redemption storyline.,I can't see them burying somebody this hard, then giving him a big two title.,They do it all the time with MITB winners. That briefcase is basically a get out of midcard-free sign.,for sure, man. I'm no inside guy, but it feels like the suits just have absolutely no faith in Ziggler. Then again, it could be good for him to stay down a little bit longer and develop more.,Ziggles really doesn't have the charisma or the soul to set himself apart from anybody.,He's a good wrestler, sells like a champ and does his moves clean and fluidly, but he just can't get himself over, and they've yet to find anybody who can get him any reaction.,They put one of their most hated heels on him and still he can't get more than moderate heat; even put him in a feud with the mark favourite Hell No. At this point, I'm surprised they haven't put Heyman on him.,There's a lot of good wrestlers out there, you've got be to able to distinguish yourself and Ziggler just doesn't have that.,People forget things quickly so long as they are not being reminded. If Ziggler wins the title at WM and goes on to be booked strongly few will remember or care that he jobbed,You are a fucking idiot if you can't tell the difference between bumping and selling.,To be fair selling is a part of bumping.,No it isn't. ,Selling and bumping work together independently. They are NOT one in the same.,That's nice.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzT,Ziggler is an average seller. He is always over the top and never tones it down.,Alright, that's your opinion, but that's just it. It's an opinion.,MUHHH FEELINGS don't mean shit to anybody else.,I will agree on you with one thing, he can't sell the RKO for shit.,No, it is not an opinion. It is a fact. I'm not saying he hasn't improved, because lord knows he was terrible in the early days of his career with the SS. ,Seems the only one with hurt feelings is you.,What exactly did I do?,You sell a bump. ,Why are you so hostile, bro?,I'm thinking he doesn't like Ziggler.,...,HEY IT'S VINCE!,dat blocklist.,What is the big fucking deal? You look like a retard when you post a screencap like that.,I question who's the attention whore here.,I'm admittedly having a bad day, but that doesn't mean I don't understand how bumping/selling works.,Yes, you sell a bump but you don't always bump to sell. That is what I mean. They are not the same thing.,The weirdest part of that post is the /wooo/ reference as there are a metric fuckton of people who post anon. You just don't notice them as much,Fair enough, man. ,So basically selling can be a part of a bump but not always and they certainly aren't the same thing.,it's only four guys,i'm quite sure one of them uses 2 trips,you're hidden because you replied to them, don't have you filtered,because they're gimmick posting, the trips are irrelevant, they're using them to create an online personality.,i brought /wooo/ up because being a gimmick poster and trying to get ""e-over"" is generally looked down on.,I'm guessing you mean because sometimes he bounces around? You know, when people fall down, sometimes they don't just fall straight down and never move again right?,Sometimes they have some real legit things to say. Sure they're a little autistic sometimes, but aren't we all?,I mean we are on 4chan after all.,honestly no, even cest didn't get as autistic as this.,That makes sense. Even being a tripfag I have to admit that a couple /asp/ies have taken it far too far. Enough to make me consider posting anon. But I like the accountability of a trip.,More autistic than a Cena mark? Yikes.,I'll admit, /asp/ has gotten on my nerves a bit too. Mostly that /asp/ championship shit. Never again.,ziggler does go too far sometimes, but it works for him, the jimmies like seeing him get tossed about, smarks love it, until it starts being detrimental to himself/the show it's okay.,regularly making shit threads that cause the rest of the board to hate us more and only managing a massive twenty posts between themselves is bad.,Not really relevant but I don't care enough to check the catalog for another wrestling thread so,Am I the only one that thinks WWE should have a full length show like saturday morning slam? It doesn't take itself seriously, and is just good fun for all involved (usually). I know that storylines and serious characters have their place but I think wacky antics do too.,I'll admit it myself, Ziggler does go overboard, like on that Ryder monkey flip where he did like 50 flips in midair is nowhere near justifiable except for the fact that, like you said, people eat it up. That's part of wrestling though, people love the sensationalism. If we just wanted pure wrestling, we'd all be watching the Olympics or would be that creepy guy at the high school meets that people are pretty sure didn't even go to that school.,His sells are a part of his charm.,Yeah that shit can go too, we probably should just keep it to the generals, but there are some people that genuinely believe that this is our board. Annoying, but we can't stop them. Really the best course of action would be to give us our own board, since it's all but been proven that we cannot coexist with others.,I love the /asp/ championship. Makes matches more entertaining to me. ,Though it is weird I find this board to be much less hostile than /wooo/ not sure why it would be though given that it is on 4chan.,if they roll raw back to 2 hours it's possible, I would be worried about over-saturation and heavy workloads though.,because whilst we share space with the rest of 4chan, we really just want to enjoy some mandrama,atleast thats how it felt back on /sp/,/woo/ is pretty pretentious about wrestling, like if you don't adhere to what they believe you're an idiot that should kill themselves.,4chan's pretty laidback about it, usually we're all cool with each other and our opinions and if we want an explanation we just ask for it.,We come here to enjoy sweaty mandrama. /woo/ comes there to prove how much smarter and better at sweaty mandrama than everyone else is they are.,I like that philosophy. ,There are a lot of people that take it far too seriously on /wooo/,Well there's a reason we're all here and not on /woo/ right?,Yep. I love post preview. haha. ,Plus I feel like good vibes are more prevalent here than on 420chan. Which is ironic.,FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,yeah you wouldn't shit all over your home, so don't shit all over the board, lest moot shits on you.,it's all about respect.,have some cutty spaghetti bro.,fuckin straightedge faggot get the fuck off my 4chan,dude, this is wrestlemania, you can expect the midcard belts to be a little off the spotlight.",,"03/30/13(Sat)00:39,03/30/13(Sat)00:40,03/30/13(Sat)00:49,03/30/13(Sat)02:41,03/30/13(Sat)02:46,03/30/13(Sat)02:46,03/30/13(Sat)02:49,03/30/13(Sat)02:51,03/30/13(Sat)02:55,03/30/13(Sat)02:59,03/30/13(Sat)03:11,03/30/13(Sat)03:13,03/30/13(Sat)03:27,03/30/13(Sat)04:58,03/30/13(Sat)05:08,03/30/13(Sat)05:22,03/30/13(Sat)05:25,03/31/13(Sun)03:56,03/31/13(Sun)10:15,03/31/13(Sun)10:21,03/31/13(Sun)10:51,03/31/13(Sun)10:54,03/31/13(Sun)11:06,03/31/13(Sun)11:11,03/31/13(Sun)11:13,03/31/13(Sun)11:28,03/31/13(Sun)11:33,03/31/13(Sun)11:41,03/31/13(Sun)11:47,03/31/13(Sun)12:04,03/31/13(Sun)12:13,03/31/13(Sun)12:27,03/31/13(Sun)12:29,03/31/13(Sun)12:36,03/31/13(Sun)12:43,03/31/13(Sun)12:44,03/31/13(Sun)12:46,03/31/13(Sun)12:54,03/31/13(Sun)12:57,03/31/13(Sun)13:00,03/31/13(Sun)13:00,03/31/13(Sun)13:02,03/31/13(Sun)13:03,03/31/13(Sun)13:07,03/31/13(Sun)13:10,03/31/13(Sun)13:10,03/31/13(Sun)13:13,03/31/13(Sun)13:14,03/31/13(Sun)13:17,03/31/13(Sun)13:19,03/31/13(Sun)13:21,03/31/13(Sun)13:22,03/31/13(Sun)13:23,03/31/13(Sun)13:24,03/31/13(Sun)13:26,03/31/13(Sun)13:27,03/31/13(Sun)13:27,03/31/13(Sun)13:28,03/31/13(Sun)13:28,03/31/13(Sun)13:29,03/31/13(Sun)13:29,03/31/13(Sun)13:29,03/31/13(Sun)13:30,03/31/13(Sun)13:31,03/31/13(Sun)13:31,03/31/13(Sun)13:32,03/31/13(Sun)13:33,03/31/13(Sun)13:33,03/31/13(Sun)13:35,03/31/13(Sun)13:35,03/31/13(Sun)13:35,03/31/13(Sun)13:37,03/31/13(Sun)13:38,03/31/13(Sun)13:40,03/31/13(Sun)13:42,03/31/13(Sun)13:44,03/31/13(Sun)13:45,03/31/13(Sun)13:46,03/31/13(Sun)13:47,03/31/13(Sun)13:48,03/31/13(Sun)13:52,03/31/13(Sun)13:55,03/31/13(Sun)13:58,03/31/13(Sun)14:01,03/31/13(Sun)14:03,03/31/13(Sun)14:05,03/31/13(Sun)14:12,03/31/13(Sun)14:18,03/31/13(Sun)14:19,03/31/13(Sun)20:16,03/31/13(Sun)20:21","Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,JadedPunk , ,03/30/13(Sat)02:41 ,JadedPunk,!o.PjKINW5M,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Carter,The Internet , ,03/30/13(Sat)02:49 ,Carter,The Internet,!!GJY1FUx1QHe,Anonymous,Anonymous,JadedPunk , ,03/30/13(Sat)02:55 ,JadedPunk,!o.PjKINW5M,JadedPunk , ,03/30/13(Sat)02:59 ,JadedPunk,!o.PjKINW5M,Anonymous,Anonymous,JadedPunk , ,03/30/13(Sat)03:13 ,JadedPunk,!o.PjKINW5M,Anonymous,Anonymous,Carter,The Internet , ,03/30/13(Sat)04:58 ,Carter,The Internet,!!GJY1FUx1QHe,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Tartarus , ,03/31/13(Sun)11:06 ,Tartarus,!lMULLerMSc,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,princess cest -

Looks badass.,They're planning on changing his name to Road Rash and making him a biker.,Really?,I hear he's floundering because all of his signature moves are banned/used by other wrestlers,WWE are giant dicks about move copying.,If you want to see this gimmick work watch some of his japan stuff ,He just gets ALBERT chants, so much so that he got reduced to acknowledging his Albert gimmick and started speaking english again, he is now in a comedy tag team with another monster turned comedy act, but at least he now has 2 hot chicks who grind against each other every enterance ,assuming this isn't a troll ,I really wanted his Tensai gimmick to work but americans in general are too ignorant to other cultures so he was just laughed at.,So is the cena heel turn coming tonight ,also was that thing about Laurenitis actually a thing or just LOLDIRTSHEETS ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULZ,You are too delusional to think this will ever happen.,He needs to lose the belly and go back to bear mode.,I wish. Still, Johnny Ace coming back was probably just an excuse for the Rock to take someone down.,He is a fucking Frenchmen.,But what am I supposed to do with this Thuganomics degree,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oc,no. We just hold them in active contempt.,best perfect-plex ever!,I haven't watched wrestling since the early 2000s.,Does Rey Mysterio still do the '619'?,I know Lesnar's gone, but he was pretty good and hard to beat back in the day,Tori Wilson? Sable? Stacy Keibler? Victoria? Any of these divas still around (and active)?,Is Vince McMahon still a gigantic douche?,Does Cena still rap? ,Is Big Show still wrestling? Kane?,When he's not injured, yeah.,He's back, and taking on HHH at Mania. Still the same old beast as always.,The division is more dead than the WCW.,Is Vince McMahon still a gigantic douche?,Thank god no.,Yes and they are one of the few still worth watching.,mfw i just saw Steve fucking blackman on that JBL & Cole show,based yuzupon,Yes but he's out with an injury again.,His style now is more MMA influenced which lends itself to No DQ brawls, check out his match versus John Cena from Extreme Rules 2012.,Victoria is in TNA unfortunately. All others are retired.,Yes.,No.,Both yes. Big show is now very fat and slow and boring, his finisher is a single KO punch. Kane is still going strong.,Big Show's punch works because the whoever takes it has been able to sell it pretty well so far.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTML,My sides,top lel You actually enjoy him dancing around?,He's overstayed his welcome. I can't wait til he retires.,Por que Maria?,me. the Gayda,If I see you on /wooo/ I'm going to be nice to you even though I think you're a prick :),Thank you. Gayda aims to please,Something for the smarks,My Bingo Card is ready for this,I'm gonna start the pre-show thread now,Lets do this,What's a mark?,Is it the target audience or something?,lol I hope we have like 3 bingo cards going like last time,Do it!,In wrestling its someone who believes the show is real,Gayda's Chard is top card,Do it based Trips.,Haitch or us Tripfags?,So who is the /asp/ champion? I took a self imposed exile after the train wreck of opening night Raw here on /asp/,*Waits for Dante to make the thread so I can get the based Gayda card*,I hope autism card guy shows up.,Clever,Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat??,Jeez. That must be a dangerous business then. I remember when I used to watch wrestling when I was about 13 and get pissed at Vince McMahon. ,But seriously?,Marks are mostly kids,You missed all of the poppycock,Yup, people still take shit that seriously. You'll see if you hang around these wrestling threads long enough.,Pre RAW thread,With that horrible hair the thumbnail looks a bit like Prime Minister Harper,What kind of faggotry is all this random text in my post!??!,Harper fucks everything up,Dammit...

Most people could quite readily afford £7.50 a week on boat club membership if they deemed it a worthwhile pursuit. Plus boat clubs often extent their student rates to anyone aged 25 or below.,Its not like a dying from not eating as I have a budget for food but this country i full of families who don't have the money to spend ,Thats because people want to middle class,Like I am viewed more as middle class myself because I am educated and work a very middle class job in a office. My roots are working class,I don't give a toss about any of this class shit, but rowing is just a fucking terrible sport and this is a nothing event that shouldn't be cluttering up the TV schedules on Easter Sunday.,I thought /asp/ would be a place we could discuss rowing without these class war faggots or trolls, but it's no better than /sp/,What the fuck are you doing to have to pay £300 a month on bills?

"Has there ever been a better fighter? Could there be a better fighter?,fedor in his prime, a good wrestler can beat anderson. cheal gave the blue print he just got careless. fedor lost to age not his opponents longest reining champion 10 years and was out sized in almost every match could hav fought at light heavy but chose to b the baddest man on the planet for 10 years. anderson is great but gsp might b able to take him and jon jones is to big,Sure, there are probably plenty of people that also choose not to compete but have skills comparable to him.,I really enjoyed that fight though, it was like watching goku fight nappa, just seeing how embarrassingly outclassed that cocky douchebag was,gsp is great in his own way, and I would almost agree with you on Jones cause he has the slight size advantage..,...but technically speaking? Is there a more enjoyable martial artist to watch? IMO Silva is GOAT and will not/can not lose.,chael came close but made a serious error when he tried a spinning attack proving the Spider is too smart and all it takes is the smallest slip up and you will lose against him.,muh nigga,im not talking about the 2nd fight -the first fight showed andersons weakness if someone wrestles him and doesnt get careless like chael did from exhaustion they will beat him,My personal favorite has always been Fedor. He isn't the most technically skilled, he isn't the strongest. He just doesn't fucking go down. Every fight, he just pulled it out and kept on going.,People thought this way about Fedor for a long time too.,more subs then ko,but fedor's the goat he was almost always undersized ,and people seem to forget fedor went unbeaten for 9 years in 33 fights never losing the pride title,silva has gone unbeaten for 7 years in 17 fights ,dana white cant rewrite records,correction fedor unbeaten in 9years in 34 fights ,at the end of the day....,His next fight,His last fight,Seems like he wouldn't have much experience between fights,Though his opponent would have gone from July to July without a fight,It's that good old soviet style he has. He goes in, no emotions, to do his work. After he finishes he packs his shits and goes back to the woods in Moscow, to train. He does this by beating down trees and benchpressing them.,wasn't chael roided, and silva like...injured? broken ribs, or something,When someone told me that he did that, in addition to dragging around anvils in the snow, I sort of assumed they were fucking with me. No, he does that, in between visits to his Russian Orthodox priest to cleanse himself to fight. It's like something out of a movie.,GSP,/thread,He goes full Rocky IV when training. Out there in the snow hitting tires with a huge hammer.,That's why he was the greatest.,thats why he fought and beat cans for 90% of his career. And when he got to the semi big leagues he got his ass handled,Fedor Emelianenko has,Yeah, small-time all the way.,It's as if he were some sort of talented, professional athlete,by the time he got to the ""big leagues"" (because fuck pride amirite guise) he was 30 something, way past his prime,the best fighters are usually young 30s,Mark Hunt is also one of my favorites. That brick-shaped fat man doesn't give a shit.,As far as his boxing goes, he's highly overrated. However, he has done the best job of using boxing in MMA, and is easily the p4p.,p4p?,u wot m8,the talent he fought against was not consistent.,mind you, he did defend the Pride belt only 3 or 4 times. the rest had no business fighting for a title.,it's the mileage not the age that does a fighter in mostly. well, cuts, injuries and brain damage, you could still grapple.,Look at Anderson's Silva first 20 fights (the majority of his career) Sakurai, Newton and Horn are the only notable names on it. None of which have ever held a Pride or UFC championship. Whilst Fedor beat 3 former UFC champions in his first 20 firsts.The best wrestler Anderson Silva has beaten is Chael Sonnen a man whose best wrestling credentials are finishing one year 8th in NCAA wrestling. Fedor has beaten Kevin Randleman who was a two time NCAA wrestling champion as well as former UFC heavyweight champion. Fedor also beat Mark coleman twice who also won an NCAA championship and was a UFC heavyweight champion. Fedor also holds a win over Matt Lindland a silver medal winner at the Olympics in freestyle wrestling.,-Even in the world of submission grappling fedor's opponents have better credentials. Fedor holds a submission of Olympic silver medallist in Judo Ogawa and a knockout over 2008 Olympic gold medallist in heavyweight Judo Ishii. Anderson to his credit owns a victory over the 2007 ADCC champion Demian Maia, but Fedor holds victories over Arona and Jeff Monson who both also won ADCC championships.,let me know when silva picks a fight he cant win,he was humbled by that fight, he had an attitude going into it and then he ran off afterwards which was funny, and he was very rude to everybody for months after that when they asked why he left so quickly,Look at Anderson's streak vs Fedor's and the level of opponents. Silva has consistently fought the #1 MW for 7 years now. And he runs through everyone. Anderson beat Dan Henderson, who is a 3 time World champ and former Olympian. Who has Coleman ever beat? Shogun doesn't count, that was a broken arm. Clearly you didn't see Fedor's last few fights where he was dominated, and look at how Anderson is doing now at the age of 37. Fedor retired when he was 35 and Silva just signed a 10 fight deal. Stop making up your excuses, every media outlet that follows UFC has Silva as #1 p4p and GOAT. Fedor has less than 8 notable wins.,fedor by armbar,we'll see what silva's record is after 34 fights then we talk,I love this faggot: WANDERLEI SILVA THE AXE MURDERER. He was a beast and still an idol in japan, but now he's kinda tired,he is my fav. i even bought an action firgure of him. him and bas are the only one that i would even buy a figure of,this guy is crazy, wanderlei silva vs kazushi sakuraba:,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfR,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGj,Man, Sakuraba made the fatal error when fighting the Axe Murderer, brawling.,I've followed MMA since the first 3 UFC fights when it was really mixed arts fighting against each other despite it being a way for the Gracies to sell dojo memberships.,I prefer the fights where the art is an art and not the modern mixed sport stuff. Give me Muay Thai vs. Tai Kwon Do. Boxing vs. Savate. ,Fedor Emilianko,I'm not even a bandwagon fan. He proved his ability during the Pride days. Gracies kicked ass pre-pride before people BJJ was an unknown.,just proves that thee french are superior warriors,Sakuraba's second fight against Wanderlei was probably the closest to beating him. vealbup um. Saku was about to secure an armlock but Wanderlei slammed him, dislocating Saku's shoulder.,ASkuraba and Fedor are certainly not better than Anderson is. Even in his prime, the best Fedor took down was Cro Cop and Arlovski, who to be fair at the time were among the best in the world, I'd even venture to say that Fedor is the second best of all time, but Anderson is even older than Fedor and has had more high level fights, all of which he has finished in a very one sided manor other than the first Chael fight.,GSP is amazing but he is not as talented as Anderson. If they fought and he won it would be purely because of a stylistic advantage. Silva has always done worse against wrestlers, but he beats them anyway.,Fedor had the most heart. And saying the best he took down were Arlovski and Cro Cop is a bit of a stretch. Another anon already mentioned those UFC-Champions who got beaten.,Fedor was barely 6 foot yet he repeatedly beat every challenger for a 10 year stretch. His accomplishments speak for themselves. He's a fucking legend and I hate how bandwagoners ditched him after losing recently.,I think being in that church fucked with Fedor. Well, this and his age. He was an animal though. I like to think it was all natural, too.,Ironically enough he himself said he thinks it's easier for him to fight those large guys. Makes me wonder.,i like fedor more. hes so cool.,Fedor is the man.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i0i,mark my words, weidman will dethrone anderson.,war strong island,jeez, I hate dana whites bitter bullshit on fedor,""fedor is done"",no fuck you, you fatass, you never owned him in the first place. Stop acting like you ever had any control over him. Like what the fuck, I have to deal with kids calling fedor an overrated can crusher because ""dana white said so."" So fucking stupid,hello dana white sheep ,fedor has more fights won and longer winning streak ,fedor's streak has 16 fights more than silva,in the end fedor by armbar,Because MMA begins and ends at UFC,also cheal is a medeocre wrestler how many world class wrestlers/grapplers has silva faced ? ,let me know when he decided to man up and fight gsp.,name one style fedor hasent faced ? ,fighting is all about styles you can be the best boxer in the world and the grappler will sub you,you cant fight one type of fighter and call yourself the goat ,I think GSP has to be the guy who agrees to fight Silva, not the other way around. Silva really can't drop another weight class, but GSP can go up one. ,Silva totally could fight Jon Jones though.,but but he;s fighiing chris weidman ,chris motherfucking who ? ,oh another mediocre collegiate wrestler ,dana white sets up the cans silva knocks them down,this is cool ,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkO1,as far as beating top name guys no one will ever have a better hitlist than Matt Hughs:, GSP, Gracie, Penn, Shierk, Trigg, and Serra,all those people are either overrate or cans. hell trigg is long dead when he died in the mountain hike.,There will always be somebody better. I just like to watch really skilled fighters. When the guy that can outclass Silva shows up, I'll be a happy man because it's just more great fights to come.,There is no greater striker than Silva. Fedor won through sheer determination and his ability to absorb damage. Silva wins through skill. He's now 38 years old, and he's STILL improving his game. Hardly his fault that no-one else in his weight division can match him.,He does have his weaknesses - the reason he can't beat Jones being that Jones would take him down and turn his face into jelly. Silva would tool Jones in standup, but Jones has no reason to keep it standing -, but he's not fighting cans. He's just that far ahead of the norm.,And unlike Fedor, he competes in a promotion that focusses on the actual, athletic side of things. Not the show. Pride was fun to watch, but the matchmaking was... Often questionable.,Does Fedor have high-level wins? Yes, absolutely.,But his longer-than-Silvas-streak contains more cans than Silva fought.,Most importantly, however, Fedor's great time was still in the early days of the sport. Fighters didn't HAVE a vaguely well-rounded game - that's why Fedor could dominate with his Sambo background.,Silva is fighting in the modern era that swept away the Pride generation - not just its old, washed up athletes that were already on a downward slope (Wanderlei, Cro Cop), but also ones who were still capable, whose stars were still shining in Pride (Shogun, Rampage).,Silva wins this.,Fedora is still better,Silva needs to ,Quit hiding behind Ed Soares,you are clearly fed your information and don't make your own decisions.,Jesus this thread is pathetic. What elite strikers has Anderson struck with? What elite grapplers has he out grappled?,He gets fed shit competition in the UFC look at his record Chael is a journey man at best don't believe the hype.,Newton was the UFC WW champ and lost it to Hughes. And Sakuria was considered the best WW in the world when he fought him.,Sakuraba was wasted by Pride making him not fight in his weight class.

And there are even people who like the ultra-violent hardcore wrestling. It's up to a given company to either try to feed all of those tastes, or to focus on a few, or even just one, and leave the other groups for other companies to pick up.,It's all taste,Will this wrestlmania sell better than last year?,It'll be close, but no.,The price increase coupled with Rock/Cena 2 are going to harm its chances.,Exactly.,Now, personally, I'm all about the high-flying indy style stuff. It's evolved in recent years to not just be a series of largely unrelated and highly telegraphed spots. Instead, it's become a case of wrestlers having to hit a series of powerful moves, rather than simply nailing one silver bullet of a finisher, in order to win a match, as well as most everyone having the ability to counter a given move and turn it into something completely different at any given instant. It can lead to some incredibly hot finishes, and there is nothing that I, as a wrestling fan, enjoy more than a match with a fantastic ending.,Now, that doesn't mean that other forms of wrestling are bad. Not at all. I love a big powerhouse match every so often, as well as the occasional big man/small man match, since they tend to tell some solid stories. A person should enjoy the kinds of wrestling that they like, and should also seek out wrestling that they haven't yet seen in order to find great action that they may enjoy every bit as much.,Amen,whats you guys biggest mark out moment,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbC0,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG-7,Is anything more sad than telling your dad what happened to Bret Hart? He was my dad's favorite wrestler in the early 90's.,I wish my dad watched wrestling,Yeah, I recently saw my dad for the first time in ages.,I was wearing my Macho Man t-shirt, and he started excitedly talking about how good he was back in the day etc. Then he asked ""What's he doing these days? I always thought he'd be a good commentator."",In fairness, I've no idea how he hadn't heard.,Y'all niggas best have paid your taxes.,Also, I have found a shitload of mid-80s WWF events from Madison Square Garden and Boston:,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZD2I,super dragons pwg return,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGr_,Brilliant.,My dads favourite Wrestler is the Miz.,I don't know why but he never stops going on about him whenever we watch Wrestling and his obsession with the Miz is starting to impact on my life,I hate my dad,Hey at least it was a car crash. My dad liked Owen Hart :(,Hey, you think that's bad? My sister's favourite wrestler is Alex Riley.,I'll let you all take a moment to digest that.,Alex. Riley.,10/10,Ah the man who's biggest push was from Kane over a table,In some ways, it's quite interesting to watch with her, because she looks at it from a much less jaded and more ""IT'S REAL TO ME, DAMMIT"" perspective. She gets that it's all staged, but still gets really invested in stuff.,That's not why she likes him. She likes him because she felt sorry for him when The Miz was giving him shit.,Fandango will beat Jericho since he is leaving after WM,then the miz did he job.,Exactly. In fairness, the Miz always does his job.,What an astute and accurate prediction, I can only ask if you are in fact Vince McMahon due to your level of knowledge of the WWE locker room,To be fair I feel sorry for anyone who gets shown up by the Miz. Just look at poor Wade Barrett, who'll probably get squashed at 'Mania.,This. ,You can not like him but at least he does his job. He is over with every single live crowd I have ever heard of.,No I am not Vince Mcmahon lol. I feel bad on Jericho though, always being used to be put against newbies so they can become ""established"",Nigga, Barrett isn't getting squashed by Miz. He will lose though. Bank on it!,Wade Barret will beat the Miz,I'll be straight honest. I like the guy, I really do. Can't buy him as a main champion, but as an upper midcarder, he's fantastic. He's definitely not the best overall in the ring, but fuck it, he's trying to be the best he can. I'm honestly impressed at how well he's made his face turn work.,That won't be a squash. I can see that going for a good 10 mins at least. I just hope they don't have Barrett tap to the figure four. If Naitch was there, I could kind of accept it, but it won't seem right otherwise.,I don't think so. We will see soon won't we?,I think he should be a main eventer but I am biased as fuck. He is for sure Upper Midcard talent though. I would also love Naitch to be Miz's manager at WrestleMania, I would mark so hard.,I'm a bit biased because I am british and Barret is british so obviously I want him to do well but his physique is much better than the Miz's so he should edge it out because he is stronger.,But what if Barrett lost to free him up for one last upper-midcard feud before he wins the MITB case and becomes World Heavyweight Champion?,obviously that would be ideal but we all know WWE never has a long term plan and it's always short term. But then tbh I've only been watching WWE since RR13,Just from a booking perspective I don't see Miz losing. They have to keep his WrestleMania win streak strong.,Rock vs Cena was a long term plan,Yeah but Rock V Cena is the main event, they probably have planned out what the Main Event for next years WM now.,I'm going to MITB live and if Barrett wins I will mark the hell out,I was just going against the notion that they never have long term plans.,As long as Miz gets an underdog spot like he has for the last couple years I will be happy.,To be honest, I sort of wanted him to win his first major title in the UK, but if he wins MITB, I'll mark the hell out too.,Although it's not entirely implausible to suggest that he could win MITB and cash it in at the November UK tapings... in Manchester. Pretty damn near to his hometown of Preston.,I can imagine the pop now...,are November tapings announced?,Yeah, but not on sale yet. They're in Manchester this year though.,Omg nice, think I am going to go for sure, when do they go on sale I want front row seats so I can get my sign on TV.,Defiantly gotta get tickets to MITB,Probably some time after the April tapings, I'd guess.,Longest WWE champion in the modern era.,If he doesn't Beniot himself, he's a shoe in.,wat. do tell,Are you kidding? He's the best heel in years. His 400+ day streak is legendary.,So I just had a random thought. ,I think Miz will be the one to unify the Midcard titles. He has been feuding with both men off and on for the last month so it makes sense. Plus it frees up Cesaro and Barrett to move up (A man can dream),Can we all agree Wrestlemania 23 was the last great Mania?,Were you even watching wrestling as much back then as you are now? I ask because people that say this never actually experienced the shit live. ,Case in point, people who think the Attitude Era was the end-all-be-all. I watched it, shit wasn't great.,Plus if he builds on his reputation for interrupting people, he's bound to have more big moments. This guy's only going up, which is why him beating the streak is plausible.,If the match at Mania was a triple threat, I'd agree, but it doesn't make sense otherwise.,Till Cena holds the title till Wrestlemania 2015, that is.,Only if a diva joins the Shield.,Yes, but I'm not saying the Manias since then aren't good but I feel they weren't great.,I think the reason it ""worked"" was that it broke cliches, blurred the lines between fantasy and reality, and had some of the most skilled Mic talents. It wasn't necessarily *good* but it was groundbreaking.,The last memorable Wrestlemania theme for me.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF_z,Ziggy n Big E beating Team Hell No,The Shield beating Randy Orton, Shamus and Big Show,Fandango beating Jericho,how likely are these things?,Last year's one with Haitch/Taker and Punk/Jericho was great. Big Show winning was also great.,Miz takes the title from Barrett, overcoming an interference from Cesaro. Next night Miz challenges Cesaro for the title and wins it. ,He will at least hold it until next Mania unless he gets injured. ,People forget there were a lot of stinkers in WM history. ,It worked because it was exactly what fans wanted at the time. I don't know about groundbreaking but I couldn't argue that it didn't work. ,2/3 of those things are happening.,Fandango is going over 100%.,Shield will win 85%,Zigg-E Langston will win 35%,Trust me, I'm a doctor.,50% chance,90% chance,95% chance,I think not because he still has that MITB and it would end up with Ziggy saying ""Oh yeah well I lost the tag team titles but who cares I'M WORLD CHAMION."",Probably not.,I got no idea.,That would also get me hard.,Sheamus or Orton are turning so I can see Shield winning again.,I would be a fan of of Ziggy, Choc Lesnar and AJ winning all the titles and maybe Big E can get a secondary title too? Perhaps I am asking too much but still. ,Shield goes over Big White Snake and Orton turns heel finally,Fandago is going over Jericho, at this point Jericho is just putting over new talent,I can see Shield winning because one of them is turning heel. Smart money on Orton.,Will Mark vs Ryback be Bork vs Goldberg 2.0 ?,No, because neither man is leaving the company, Ryback is on the verge of a huge push to the title, and Mark Henry is fucking glorious.,So Cena vs Ryback will be the next feud?,with what randys been saying on twitter i would say he will turn heel,Cena and Randy Orton next feud,Quick question,,Who will Cena feud with after WM?,Feud Cena with Ryback first. Give Ryback the title.,Then feed Orton to Ryback.,Again? Well that's not too bad I guess.,I don't follow him on Twitter, so have no idea what's been said.,Assuming Cena's heel turn actually happens, yes.,If he turns heel, Ryback.,If he stays face, Orton.,It's more likely that our next Tag Team Champions are Owen Hart and [name redacted],Although, looking, I guess you mean:,I would love a Cena heel turn, hes so desperate for the win over the Rock he hires the Shield to attack the Rock or some such nonsense,It's unlikely, but if it's going to happen, it has to be against The Rock, if that makes sense.,I think there's more to this Johnny Ace re-emergence than meets the eye.,yeah and hes been saying shit like that for the better half of last year,cena would never turn heel because ""only bad people can be heels"" considering cenas a peice of shit outside of the ring himself,Thugonomics pls,It's the basic thuganomics,I could see Cena turning heel if Rock wins and Ziggy cashes in. Remember how he went on about how his life went in a tailspin after losing to Rocky the first time? He'd probably just be super pissed and turn then.,If only,its all cenas fault his life went into a tailspin.,its only logical that his wife would divorce him when she found out he was fucking pornstars and divas,Only on WHC, remember?,Well they could pull a CM Punk card and Cena can become amazingly arrogant even pointing out the whole CENAWINSLOL aspect of his career and be that kind of heel.,Ziggler CAN'T cash in on the WWE title. His case is for the WHC. There's going to be no bullshit reason for him to cash in on the WWE title, because let's fucking face it, good as he is, he's not ""main man of the entire WWE who isn't called John Cena"" good.,I like this guy on /woo/'s idea. To start a stable with at least Cena and Punk. Cena helps punk beat the streak and Punk helps Cena beat The Rock. This will be the ULTIMATE SWERVE,go to bed russo,replace cena with daniel bryan then best in the world would be fitting,I just woke up, nigger. You know you want that,Does anyone in the UK watch Wrestletalk?,A little bit. When I am looking for shoot promos,inb4 punk and cena become wwe's aries and roode,Why would they waste Cena's heel turn on facing some actor?,He wil lturn next year when Punk/HHH/Vince help him end the streak.,Cena will turn heel with the streak this year. He will help punk and will make news,That would be...,Awful.,Ending the streak would be dumb. Its one of the main reasons people get pumped for 'Mania. Even though I know Taker hasn't got many matches left in him, it'd make more sense to keep that part of his legacy.,No he wont. ,He isnt gonna appear in the Taker match before his own match. That would make 0 sense.,Also they wont end the streak because Cena vs. Taker needs to happen at WM.,cena wont turn heel yet because of the lack of legitimate baby faces to present a threat to him. not to mention he is a merch selling powerhouse and turning him heel ruin it.,What if Punk/Taker closes Wrestlemania?,Undertaker needs to retire this year. Cena can secretly help Punk then Punk will openly help Cena,cm punk played second fiddle to cena all last year so i guess rock/cena will close,It wont.,This COULD work but like I said. ,It will be WM30 and Cena/taker will happen. There is a reason they have kept Cena and Taker apart for like 10 years.,But what if The Streak were to end? That'd have to close Mania, surely?,but its not gonna end because Taker needs to fight Cena at WM.,That would be a massive draw they wont not do it.,But Why would Undertaker stay another fucking year? They did feud before back when Cena was heel,cena ending the streak would be a terrible mistake considering he is at the point in which his career is all but over.,yeah in 2003 when Cena was a fucking midcarder.,Taker will stay another year because they will ask him to.,CM Punk has to end the streak. They need the Punk/Taker match to be main event so that Cena can swerve ,Undertaker needs to retire. He should NOT stay for another year. That's fucking retarded. He leaves for a year anyways,Allegedly, they WERE planning to do it.,At Wrestlemania 28.,Then Rock came back so they scrapped the plans in favour of the far bigger dream match with the more exclusive star. The moment for Cena vs Taker has passed.,ITT: Delusional Punk marks trying to convince themselves he will end the streak,or they can just put it back a year,I'm not a Punk mark, I just think Cena ending the streak would be fucking retarded. Punk is worth the streak and can use it very well throughout his heel career.,Cena vs Taker would be fucking stupid and not sell a god damn thing,Two years, now.,It depends. I am under no delusion that Punk will win, but if Taker's only got one more Mania match left in him after this I don't want it wasted on Cena. If he can last until Wrestlemania 31, great. Fine. But if they do end it at the big XXX then I'd like to see them end it on a more creative, worthwhile note than ""just give it to Cena"".,what in the blue fuck,i agree totally with this. the build with this feud was fucking golden,Cause he really needs it to go over, right?,Cena vs. Taker would be a massive draw. You sound pretty ABJC which is clouding your judgement.,but its Cena's heel turn. it would truly start a new era because it would involve a bunch of people helping him.,really it would have been perfect to have The Shield help him except he isnt fighting Taker this year.,lexi belle is a fake ass hooker how dare you mention her in the same breath as sasha grey,Stop this madness. This is why people get mad at WWE, they fantasy book stuff that will never happen, then get mad when it doesn't happen.,CM Punk can handle the win and become the ultimate heel. Bragging about it ALL THE TIME. Undertaker deserves to go out putting someone over AND going out in a great feud with a great worker,It's wouldn't be a huge draw. I've never wanted to see them wrestle each other. They aren't on the same wave lengths and the match would be fucking boring. I've never heard ANYONE say ""I would LOVE to see Taker vs Cena"",He used to be good. But he got fat.,Lose the weight, grow the hair back.,Tajiri is running his own promotion.,I think I've missed a part of the conversation somewhere along the line.,What, exactly, is wrong with Cena turning heel at this Mania against Rock instead?,Why can't we start this 'new era' now instead of waiting another year?,They will want to see Taker/Cena because WWE will tell them to.,cenas never going to turn heel because he beleves you have to be a legitamate bad person to to be a heel even though the dudes a grade a peice of shit,i would have perfered someone whoses career is just starting to give them a huge push but i think punk can pull it off,No has ever wanted to see that match,oh my god. actually lold at this. how fucking mad can you be? ,stay deluded.,are you taking the piss?,no one except for the ""smarks"" on the internet would rather see those things and most of you lot dont even pay for WM so you are irrelevant.,Which ny the same token means that they won't be missing out if WWE decides to not book the match and so never tells them to. Like they did last year.,With the fact that The Rock is the better person for Cena to turn heel on? Undertaker vs Cena would be all types of shit,Many fans would pay money to see Sting in WWE and retiring Taker,I hate to say it but the Miz is built more and acts more like a Marine than Cena.,This.,There's actually chemistry between Cena and Rock. Not to mention backstory. Cena has good reason to turn heel on him. Refusing to just so that he can turn on some guy he has no heat with a year later would reek of swerve for the sake of swerve.,im not mad at all,you seem to be implying that taker/cena would draw more than a match between 2 of the greatest icons in professional wrestling today,you sir are the one who is delusional,Cena turning heel and Punk being the streak will make news. WWE can not pass that up,wrestling will never be socially relevant you have the attitude era to thank,Either one would make news. I ain't greedy; one other other would be good enough for me.,Which is why I'm not holding out hope that either will happen. WWE most definitely can pass it up, because Vince doesn't give as many fucks about seeing business prosper as he does about having his own way.,The publicity behind ending the streak? Vince loves publicity. Isn't that why they book celebrity matches?,vince is safe booking so i dont think he is going to pull a big swerve,They need a swerve,He loves seeing Punk squirm and Taker win more. The temptation of 'publicity' hasn't been enough to make him end the Streak for 22 years, and I doubt that he honestly sees Mr anti-corporate skinny fatass as a more worthy Streak ender than Batista, or HBK, or his own son-in-law.,Punk wasn't rushed out of the WWE Title scene because they had plans for him to beat Taker. He was rushed out because they simply don't want him sullying their precious Cena-beats-Rock moment, and tossed in with Taker since they were both free with nothing else to do. Seriously dude; don' get your hopes up for a Punk win. Save yourself the disappointment.,WWE knows Punk makes them more money,they desperately need a swerve or for vince to quit to turn the bussiness around because what they are doing now is turning fans off wrestling,They do.,Which is why they won't have one.,Because admitting that would entail Vince admitting that his booking strategy of the past 10 years doesn't work.,He's more likely to have Cena go over clean by way of STF, cut a tearful promo about the importance of Never Giving Up and prance around the ring with MakeAWish kids in a 15 minute victory celebration just to SPITE all of the fans in the arena who don't like how he books things.,If that doesn't cause a riot, we'll have to give up on WWE.,And yet they have a track record of failing to capitalize on it. If they cared about Punk making them money, they wouldn't have derailed his momentum in summer 2011 to get Haitch vs Nash over. Or put his title matches in the midcard over and over so that Cena vs Johnny Ace could main event. Or treated him like such a bitch for the past few months. Taker's going fucking over.,They have a chance to pull the biggest swerve in Mania history,What if it was all in a storyline. Cena becomes a corporate heel stating that WWE gave him the winning edge in all his matches and all his title runs to show people that they have no future in the business or soemthing (too lazy to think of the whole storyline) ,Maybe someone told Vince that this would be best for the company,I imagine that it would.,And Vince will tell Cena to completely no-sell it.,Look at it this way. We all know there won't be a swerve. So imagine how hard we'll mark when the streak finally does end unknowingly. Or Cena finally turns his back on the kids.,It won't happen. But if it does, shit will be glorious. Just turn yourself off from it happening. Like the one guy above said, stop fantasy booking, and Mania will be enjoyable to you this year.,Now you're thinking WWE style.,This is Vince.,The guy who's such a control freak that he gets direly mad when he sneezes. The guy who's gone on spontaneous firing sprees just to flex his power.,He doesn't give two shits about what anyone else has to say on the matter. The way he sees it it's HIS company, only HE knows what's best for it and and it'll be booked the way HE wants it goddammit. Fuck what anyone and everyone else thinks.,This, Vince has never listened to anybody but himself. That's why he eventually fired Russo, Hogan and a whole list of others, because he can't handle an ego like his own behind him telling him that he's wrong.,Well nobody but Linda.,cena would go through a meat grinder and no sell it,So if multiple people believed it was best and convinced him using the money aspect of things, he wouldn't listen?,I guess you're right. It's not going to happen.,if that true how come the kliq were around for so long?,cmon guise rise above hate,Shawn, Shawn was his golden boy. When you're Vince's golden boy you can pretty much rape like 10 women right in front of his eyes and Vince will turn the other cheek.,I mean he did when Pat Patterson was buggering buttholes of young male roadies.,WCW used to book Kevin Nash like this. Observe.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HY_,i understand that vince was fucking shawn but they all pushed vince around something terrible and kept their jobs,People have been saying that Cena turning heel / someone breaking the Streak would be great for business for many years now, and he hasn't budged. I don't see why now should be any different.,Also, this is all for the sake of arguement. Our smarky hopes and dreams are not reflected by the people who actually work in WWE. I strongly doubt that there is, in fact, a large group of writers and network execs telling Vince to turn Cena heel & put Punk over Taker, no matter how hard we might want it to be true. I'd like these things to happen, but I see no reason to hold out hope.,Vince goes a long way for friends of his golden boys. Hell, for anybody he likes really. I mean you see how he buries the Usos, he doesn't give a shit about them. He only continues to give them money because he likes Rikishi.,As long as they didn't get too out of hand Vince could handle Nash and Hall, but when they did you see he didn't hesitate to tell them to hit the pavement.,I'm hoping for a miracle,nash and hall left on their own accord but i get what your saying. the scum will always rise to the top,The sheer amount of tripfags and queers enjoying fake ass wrestling as adults is just saddening.,Eat shit,How does it feel ditching things you genuinely enjoy because you cares too much what people think?,Stay mad,They should have had Cena lose to Taker and Rock comeback against somebody else.,Inatead of Haitch and Taker 2.0,Shit must have gotten real in that match,The fact that you simply couldn't resist the urge to come over to tell us that tickles my jimmies something wonderful.,shit did, was using a crappy camera back then,just let people have fun,Please tell me your just following kayfabe?,Because Russo and Hogan under the same roof kills companies. For recent proof, see TNA.,How long has he being doing the Ankle Lock, Body Scissors combo? ,They were just examples listed in no particular order.,If you wanna go back to a further example of Russo and Hogan annihilating promotions together, just look at WCW.,Back in the good old days, theyd just beat their ass for real. *MAKE* them sell it. Even if it took consecutive weeks of severe beatings before the match.,angle does it on rare, rare occasion, ,he had been draggin him around for a while in a regular ankle lock,Yeah, thats why I said recent.,In their defense, they're good in short dosages. Russo's good when he has people to curb his stupidity, and Hogan's good as long as you don't let his ego have any real precedence.,How would you feel,I would laugh my black ass off, but I imagine there would be some massive anal annihilation.,How would YOU feel?,I can see that happening so Haitch can get 10 more minutes of screen time,done dumping my tna pics, later ya'll,Thanks based TNAbro.,lol that dumbass ref didn't help much either,Mmmmmmm young talent.,Guess we know why him and Paul get along so much.,Sting refuses to work with WWE. Supposedly he wants nothing to do with Vince.,top lel,i saved this pic for 4chan but i dunno where else to post it,In the off chance that he does. People will pay to see Mania,Best wrestling gimmick,I miss Tyson Kidd,;_;,He still works for WWE,underage& plz,A lot of it has to do with how the WWE does contracts. I could see him just for a few wrestlemania build up months and then leaving. Thats it.,Could you imagine Vince's Anal Devastation if they had gone through with it, letting Sting have whatever contract he wanta for this, then at the end of the match, Undertaker gives Sting the streak, by not kicking out like planned. With the ref shocked, visibly shocked at what he just did.,Then Sting cuts a promo. A short one. Then the lights go out and hes gone. Back to TNA with the streak.,Vince would never give TNA the streak,I still wonder how Haitch and Steph will run the company when Vince dies. I'm expecting a major improvement.,Also, I heard a rumor that the WWE has pre-planned a tribute episode of RAW in the event of Vince's demise. The plan is for the entire episode to be a funeral with Stone Cold, Bret Hart, and HHH giving eulogies.,They asking for trouble. I have a feeling Bret hasn't truly forgive the WWE.,Maybe that is left over from that failed storyline when his car blew up,Bret's eulogy would be the most entertaining due to his bored face every time he comes back,Wouldn't you be too, I bet he only comes back because the money's good.,Seems more dejected than anything though. He probably gets chewed out by Martha every time.,Speaking of Martha. Does anybody else notice she looks like a female version of Owen?,ThatIsTheJoke.jpg,Still, I really do hope it's true. Vince was always good at acknowledging how much of an evil sonofabitch he is, and I doubt he'd want the tribute to be 3 hours of ass-kissing.,I'm surprised that they even reference that storyline. If I recall, events surrounding some random dude forced them to abort it.,Needs more my feet hurt.,It would look like this the whole time,That guy with the double murder suicide?,No,Exactly. So when another kickout pinfall occurs on schedule, Undertaker just doesnt kick out.,Because he decided to do it himself.,SWERVE AS FUCK,Taker doesn't always agree with Vince, but he wouldn't do anything that would ruin his good graces with the fans.,who? He did what now?,(seriously, the comparisons between Vince McMahon and Josef Stalin are too disturbing to ignore),I believe so. I remember all those times the title was in the hands of that gu-.... VACATED ,Just fucked up a post on /woo/ ABORT /woo/!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I'm 21 and weight 111bs at 6ft, is it too late for me to become a Wrestler?,No,OK,dubs decides my name, post ending in 8 decides my gimmick,The Fagginator.,Zahvire,Gimmick is after by the way,The Little Teacup,Cock Goblin.,Jerry Changa,Dickeater.,So it is settled, I shall be Dickeater.,8 and my gimmick is I like dicks,Then any discussion involving the streak ending goes that way.,So...shut the fuck up.,Yes,Who is that?,oh and this is your gimmick btw 'cuz the other one was a silly name,Are Stone Cold and Vince mates in real life?,Hm?,If it's a legitimate lose and an actual good match, nobody would be pissed at the Taker for dropping it, it's a burden to have.,I doubt him just dropping the streak would cause disdain like dropping it in a shitty, backstabbing fashion so unlike him would.,/asp/ - Sports Entertainment,Are any of you Wrestlers?,Is it a difficult business to get into?,Giving the streak to TNA would be terrible for Vince,No, and yes it kind of is. You have to learn the skills it takes and then work your way through the indies of pro wrestling. Establishing yourself as unique and talented,As long as they both put on a good show and it last more than 10 minutes, it would be worth it for Taker to do it.,Just....lol.,I know. Imagine the butthurt. The Galactic Scale Asspain. Everywhere.,Why? ,It's really moot because it would not be something that Mark as a person would do. He threatened to beat Vince's ass himself for screwing over people, why would he go against himself like that?,In my everyday like I plan on selling every hit like Dolph Ziggler and cutting Stone Cold/ CM Punk like promos. When people annoy me I plan on doing wrestler impressions,So he can finally fucking retire. Dudes ancient. And the injuries have built up.,Or he could just retire and stop being autistic about the streak.,Speaking of autism, I think I forgot to plug the Official Steam Group! I expect to see people in the group chat for Raw tomorrow!,http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CE,I just autistically marked out to this video,http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xx,my autism enjoyed this

offered it to I don't think he cares all about it.,No, they both seem to have some interest in wrestling so the match will be better.,Jesus, I just spat my beer everywhere, asshole.,Imagine how the wrestling world would be rocked if Taker/Sting planned that shit out and executed it in the main event of WWE's biggest event of the year with millions watching.,It would literally be the swerve

"You know.... this doesn't actually look that bad,besides the large tag team matches are there any other 'special' matches like Hell in a Cell or Cage Matches or anthying?,Haitch vs Brock is No Holds Barred, and HHH must ""retire"" if he loses,All I see are rematches except for Taker/Punk and Dorito/WeThePeople. Then there are building new stars matches like Y2J/Fandango, Shield/Big White Snake and Ryberg/Henry.,Barret lost the belt to Miz,Sandow looks very well... endowed there,Looks like a busy Wrestlemania, even if it is like 5 hours this year. I still hope Cesaro gets to do something, even if it's just preshow. He's good versus Justin Gabriel or Sin Cara.,Too many matches again.,It will be rushed like last year. ,They will spend 1 hour for Cena vs The Rock,Missed one match OP,Who are the ladies in the top far left pic?,Cameron on the left,Naomi on the right,Match card looks so fucking unimaginative.,Only 4 matches have great build up and the rest are literally piss break.,So basically no special matches.,What stipulations would improve those matches?,hardcore even though ""muh pg"" or something like a burial match,I don't know if this is good or bad.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Vf,Punk wants time off after Wrestlemania, assuming he loses a Buried Alive match would be great,hell no vs ziggler and big e in a TLC for the titles, only one i could think of that mite b cool. the rest you can't really do much with.,del rio swagger should be submission,Which match is going to be the surprise squash match?,Prolly tag titles, give D-Bry a hilarious Wrestlemania losing streak gimmick XD,Swagger v. Rio, Ryback v. Henry, Beeg & co. v. SHEBD seem to be the only competently-planned/built matches.,Cena was pretty good on Monday, I was impressed. Pretty lame ending to the segment and thus RAW though.,I like the Fandango vs Jericho feud. It's simple but it works.,Go to Sleep, Vince. ,Yeah Rock, we need you back for 2 nights. We'll give you the title, you can show up on RAW once, and after Mania you can go back to Hollywood. We just have no legit main event. ,Team We-Can't-Write-For-You (Orton, Shamus, Big Show, arguably the most limited gimmick wrestlers in history),Taker just needs another win, and we should continue to burry Punk,Triple H isn't doing anything, so he comes out of retirement only to go back afterward (see Rock) ,Everything else I've probably/will probably see on Smackdown. ,Worst Mania ever? Worst mania ever.,Excuse me if I still enjoy matches for the sake of entertainment,I stopped following wrestling a couple years ago... And when the fuck did Kane put his mask back on?,When he was pretending to be the Man in the IRon Mask,It's going to be great or terrible, depending on who you ask. The matches look really hit or miss, so the quality of this show is pretty unpredictable. I'm still hyped for it though, it's wrestlemania after all,Money in the bank?,aaaaaand its gone,1. Del Rio vs. Swagger,2. Shield vs. Show/Orton/Sheamus,3. Chris Jericho vs. Fandango,4. Undertaker vs. CM Punk,5. Hell No vs. Big Show Off,6. Ryback vs. Henry,7. Rock vs. Cena,8. Rhodes Scholars vs. Tensai Brodus,..,...,9001. Woi vs. Miz ,...,...,900000000001. Haitch vs. Bork,last year,The cash in m9,taker vs punk match. there is no title,Rhode Scholars vs Brodus match is a piss/snack break,Why is there no US championship match? where the fuck is cesaro in the card?,MID CARD HELL,Punk vs. Undertaker could have been so much better.,Rock vs. Cena doesn't need the WWE Title, they don't even care about it, Rock doesn't even carry it around, doesn't talk about the WWE or Wrestlemania. It's an afterthought.,Punk with the streak vs. Undertaker with the streak for the WWE Title would have been GOAT Wrestlemania. They really dropped the ball. Then they could drop that shitty Extreme Rules PPV and give us back King of the Ring when Undertaker vacates the title after Wrestlemania. I wanna cry thinking what could have been.,Poor Cesaro. He raped Miz during their US Championship feud, and he's stuck watching while Miz/Woi get a match. The heel crowds don't give a shit about, and the babyface crowds don't give a shit about.,Only matches I am excited for as of right now is Taker vs. Punk and Sheild vs. Faces.,If there was any shot Jericho would win I would be excited for that match since I'm expecting it to be good.,Seeing a recent rematch at WM drives me insane. This is supposed to be the PPV of PPVs you shouldn't throw out a rematch especially on the main event level.,Also straping the belt on rock even though I like it makes that match way too predictable.,nigga, Extreme Rules 2012 was GOOD.,Since two of those guys are only having their first matches at Wrestlemania, it's not that bad,UNLEASH,THE ,AMBROSE,unless theyre planning on letting ziggy cash in his MiTB on the winner,b-but Ambrose is the leader r-right guys,Reigns is the only one who's gonna matter once WM is over, since he's Rock's cousin or some shit like that.,Ambrose is the mouth piece, Reigns is the guy,What's going on with the USA USA title?,Hour Pre-Show,Last i remember, all three of the shield members speak for the shield.,See:,late 2011, early 2012,Wrestlemania now has filler matches,There is no hope,Blame Jericho for wanting to ""help out the new guys and put people over"" a.k.a get a wrestlemania paycheck and time on the biggest PPV of the year even when he fucks off with his band for months at a time but somehow get none of the flack that rocky gets for doing it,But Jericho actually shows up on RAW every week and wrestles on TV. The Rock shows up to cut another shitty promo and doesn't even wrestle on TV. You have to pay for his shitty matches,Because when he comes back he actually shows up at shows and wrestles and puts over new talent,you fags act like you're actually paying for the ppv,the majority of you will probably find some stream site to watch it on anyway,You got me!,It would be awesome if the Shield enter the ring via rappeling from a helicopter. Unfortunately that won't happen.,I might buy it but it depends, don't know if you can record Sky Box Office,Hes done nothing but impress. ,1.Reigns,2.Rollins,3.Ambrose,lel at HHH's hairy chest,only ones I don't like the look of are Niggler vs Hell No and Mark vs Ryback,Card's starting to grow on me, definitely isn't blowing me away.,But it has the potential to be an alright Mania.,Rock vs Cena - Should be good, Cena wins,Del Rio vs Swagger - Should be good,Punk vs Taker - Not really looking forward to this, Taker wins,Lesnar vs HHH - Should be good,Team Hell No - Don't like them as a team,Big Show, Randy Orton - Same problem,Barrett vs Miz - Should be good,Henry - *cough*,Brodus - *cough*,Jericho vs Fandango - Should be good,WrestleMania will be the night of Team Ziggler,Rollins is my fave but that's just me,Wow, what are you a faggot? Do you hate science or something?,Fandangoing over,So he's cashing in right?,I think he'll attempt it almost certainly, but I don't know if he'll get interrupted, or simply fail to cash in, or actually succeed. I'd like to guess he wins it,hes good but nnnnaaahhhh,What are you talking about?,Taker/Punk is the only good looking match on that card.,Y2J/Fandango looks decent, the rest looks generic and boring.,I have varying levels of excitement for every match on the card. Can't wait to see Miz win the title either.,Like last year, should be a good match but it will be crapped on by the IWC since it wasn't technical wrestling masterpiece. Only bad thing is of course: CENAWINSLOL!!!,I expect a great match here. Whether Ziggler cashes in or not I hope Swagger doesn't walk out with the title.,Should be an enjoyable brutal brawl. I want Triple H to win just because I enjoy Lesnar getting his ass kicked.,Most likely a great match (don't think it will match Taker's previous matches with HBK and HHH though) and 21-0.,Show, Sheamus and Randy finally get a win over the Shield.,I'm not expecting much out of this other than lots of Powermoves and finally Ryback giving Henry the Shellshock.,Piss Break. Team Funk Wins. That is all.,I think Team Hell NO will win but they will break up soon. I just don't picture Ziggler and Big E as Champs.,Jericho will job, Fandango will continue to be pushed and Fandango will continue to suck.,Barrett is my overall favourite and I don't even care about this match. I don't know who wins to be honest, I want Barrett to win just cause it's Barrett and I hope he stops being poorly booked soon.,Overall: I say it's a decent card.,I don't think the IWC crapped on Rock vs Cena because it wasn't a technical masterpiece. We crapped on it because Rocky just can't go anymore and it is painful to watch.,I love how in ever picture in OP the heel is frowning. Just noticed that.,Lel, TNA's B-PPV's have better cards than this.,TNA has A-PPVs? Colour me surprised,Nah jk, Lockdown was pretty cool,Based fandango heelwork, keep working dem marks,his gimmick was dead on arrival. Jericho is just jobbing for his WM paycheck, and who can blame him,Slammiversary/BFG has already been better than Wrestlemania will be.. oh, and Lockdown too!,I don't really care for WWE nowaday, it's the same ol' boring formula week-in week-out.. saying that, I will be watching Mania as they're showing it at a pub near me so a group of us are going.,Lockdown was the first good TNA ppv in the last 12 months. The only reason you don't say the same about TNA that you do for WWE is because TNA is only on for two hours a week.,Nah, I just find WWE boring and have done since about 2003... not only that but the fart jokes 'n stuff make me cringe. Vinnie Mac is doing a great job at catering to kids though as it really does feel like a kids show nowadays.,i'm dying for a new attitude era. if the wrestling's gonna suck balls at least gimme some good humor.,How to fix WWE's RAW/SD! atmosphere overnight:,1. Michael Cole relegated to secondary commentator. He just can't be the main guy anymore.,2. Stop trying to tell out 15,000 seat venues, you're stretching and it really shows,3. Minimum age limit,Boom.,It wouldn't work outside of the 90's unfortunately. If they tried to pull anything edgy it'd be Jersey Shore-esque or whatever is hot at the moment..,From your post I am going to guess that you just don't watch much of the product at all.,Didn't know encouraging piss breaks and changing channels was quality heel work. Man, times have changed.,Only three matches in that card aren't piss breaks. I better drink a whole load of water before watching.,Stay classy San Diego,Smarks are silly sometimes. I know because I am one. Arooo,I do from time-to-time as my friends are WWE marks, I watched the Rumble 'n anything to do with Bryan/Kane felt cringy as hell. ,Oh, and I watched a bit when The Rock came back until I realized it was actually smiling Dwayne Johnson and not The Rock.,I'm a Britbong and I don't get it why the WWE keeps telling the audience that they have 18,000 plus fans, sold out when the camera is focusing entirely on the lower boxes and ringside.,Also, what's up with the ratings every after commercial break?,ugh, that's probably true. i'm just sick of seeing the same 6 superstars recycled in lame matches on RAW and SD. hopefully mania shakes things up.,So you have barely watched any of it but label it all as boring? Ok cool. ,That was an issue in the Attitude Era too though...Seriously, why do we have such a short memory? It has always been a thing. There are a couple handfuls of guys that WWE cares about and that is it. ,The only reason we tire of the feuds now is that they play out every single show for the most part. We need the brand split back, not the attitude era.,The ""Did you know blah blah longest running weekly episodic blah socially active"" stuff?,Vinny Mac propaganda basically. Also he wants to reassure people that it's okay to watch ""sports entertainment."",sooo in singles matches the guy in the background confirmed for sinning?,*winning fuck,Punk and Henry won't win, almost certain. Swagger might but that's irrelevant because Ziggler's cashin in babyyyyyyy,I hate micro-reigns on important titles, and Swagger has no business being a former 2-time World Heavyweight Champion. Also that would probably turn Ziggler face if he beat Swaggie.,anagram magic,i've only started really watching again since a little before rumble so maybe i jumped the gun on blaming the era.,but it doesn't change the fact that i feel the wwe's gotten a little lackluster with its weekly installments. and maybe you're right. a brand split would make them use more superstars at least.,any wwe event where the two main match outcomes are THAT obvious is a huge fail,What if Cena turns heel?,What if Owen Hart and [name classified] return and compete for the Tag Team championship? That's more likely than Cena turning heel.,Care to wager a pitcher of piss?,/wooo/ pls,That rather pisses me off.,Agreed. By the time RAW is over I just feel burnt out and that is just the first day of the week.,I'm constantly amazed at how RAW can be full of boring filler and overrun.,One of these should go before the end of the year,Same here. Or even worse, the same match every RAW,I loved Main Event when it started because it was booked really well. Now it is just Superstars.,This.,I just can't justify staying up until 4am for RAW.,4:15 you mean.,roundabouts yeah,Didn't the extra hour come before the traditional 2 hours? So it ends around the same time as always?,it happening,no, 1am to 4am,Going to a rasslemania party. Don't really follow it.,Any tips to fit in? Will weed make it better?,So before it was 1am to 3am?,yes,yes,Don't know, haven't watched high. But I'd try to gauge how smarky the party is before going.,If it was three hours of entertainment, it'd be fine. But it very rarely is. It's one hour of entertainment spread over three hours fifteen minutes.,When you get RAW's like the one a few weeks back, with CM Punk vs Cena in the main event, it's totally worth it. But then you get RAW's like Monday's with the Cena/Rock promo.,I didn't even watch that raw, like i said it's hard to justify staying up, and the magic isn't there if i don't watch it with the game threads.,Oh okay. I'm UK so I'd appreciate if it was 2 hours, if they manage to trim the fat of recaps and shitty segments preferably. US is on daylight saving right now so we're 12am to 3am which is alright,yeah it's not as bad, i'll give it a few raws after mania, if im still not feeling it i'll just keep following dbry/ziggler on here until i feel like watching again.,I haven't watched WWE since 2003, and I don't know who any of these people are but they don't belong at Wrestlemania.,I take it back, the orange guy looks like the main eventer from hell, should be him versus Big Show with special guest referee Mick Foley and JR on commentary.,I don't think American crowds would take kindly to a wop respresenting these UNITED STATES at WRESTLEMANIA,Well, Wrestlemania went up another 10 dollars this year...,Not long now then until Cena turns heel, I can't wait for his first promo after fucking over Rock at WM.,this could only happen if cm punk goes face.,What... makes you say that,The triple main event is depressingly counter-productive. A return to complete Cena domination after several years of baby steps away from it, a massive ego massage for a veteran who's not even around anymore at the expense of a monster heel who WILL be, and an uninspired last-minute excuse to get the remaining 2 big stars into the top billing since they didn't bother thinking up actual angles for them.,And the midcard's the typical WWE midcard; no thought, no effort, to attempt to make it feel special, just a lazy attempt to get everyone Vince likes in regardless of whether there's any spark to it. Good lord this is depressing. So much potential, squandered.,The only highlight is Ryback vs Henry slap-dab in the middle. Unstoppable force meets immovable object. The kind of simple-but-effective clash that Wrestlemania was built on. More of that.,someone has to be the draw for the kids, who will fill cena's shoes if cena is the heel? nobody on the active roster comes close to having the rapport with the jimmies cena has. just let it go.,ANYONE! The main draw in WWE is the WWE brand itself, and the kids look up to him because he's the big strong cool superhero who's on top of the fucking world. They'll eat up any old shit - Sheamus, Ryback, the fucking Miz - if they were booked with the same reverence as Cena IF ONLY WWE WOULD STOP BERING SO INSUFFERABLY TERRIFIED OF CHANGE AND PULL THE FUCKING TRIGGER ALREADY,would take too long, why disregard cena when he's still raking in millions. cena will be the main man until he drops dead from exhaustion, he's lost his friends, his marriage, destroying his body and he doesn't take a day off. you're stuck with him until he physically cannot walk down that ramp every Monday night.,I disagree with the sentiment that it;d take too long. When Ryback went form fighting jobbers to fighting the Champion in a matter of weeks fans were absolutely rabid for him. The Feed Me More chants were tangibly ferocious in those pre-HiaC segments. People were taken aback by something as unheard of as WWE actually taking a big chance with a new guy, and ate it up greedily. Over like a motherfucker in an instant, and if they'd kept they'd kept booking him skywards instead of stalling on it and sending him back to the midcard he might have well become a contender to Cena's throne instead of the bald berk who barely gets a reaction.,there's a massive difference between john cena and ryback, both in pops and merchandise sales/PR work.,no shit, the point is john cena wasn't made in a day, and it's about time they create the next top guy. or do you think cena is inherently brilliant at that stuff?,... are you serious? Punk had a 400+ day reign, he's fucking golden right now. And losing to Taker at mania is the farthest thing from burial.,http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestleman,no just pointing out ryback isn't anywhere near ready, and that a heel turn in one weeks time for john cena is borderline delusional.,Surely this guy isn't relevant anymore? Who's next, KISS to perform on RAW?,Vince should let his trust issues go and create a new guy, he thinks all the wrestlers in his company are just using the WWE to skyrocket their future Hollywood/MMA/TV show careers.,Punk and Cena are both nearing the end of their careers. I see them both shifting from full time talent in the next two years. ,Who could take the mantle? ,all that said one of these four are the only guys I could see truly being ""the"" guy in the next few years. ,ADR has expressed an interest to leave within the next 5 years, Wade Barrett can't get over, and The Shield seem to be heading to ""Creative has nothing for you"" territory (That is probably too pessimistic though),easy solution. Swagger gets dq'd and knocks dorito out which allows for ziggler to win the title.,Why,that would be fucking amazing, kiss put on a helluva show.,it would never be dbry, because of the trust issues between the company and talent made elsewhere,its better than limp bizkit doh,are you sure this isn't wrestlemania 20,They should just bring Fred Durst back in WM30 ,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ljr,Who?,don't worry, even tho you recognize kane he's a completely different person now. he even went thru anger management. he only recently went back to wearing a mask for some reason.,The only missing people they have are Christian, Mick Foley, Ric Flair and Goldberg,i liked when they had the celebrity guest stars on raw. nothing screams entertainment like peewee herman getting in the face of a wrestler 3 times his size and says ""i know what you are but what am i? heh heh"",If John Cena turns heel successfully then there will be no-one imaginable better to sell the crowd on a new top face. That is pretty much the main purpose of heels, is to make the crowd want the face to be triumphant. And given that 50% of regular crowds already boo the fuck outta Cena, if he can convincingly heelturn to the point that even the mummys and little kids don't want to cheer for ceenee, he'll instantly be the best heel in years. Give Ryback a decent shot wrestling against that for the WWE championship and crowds really are going to believe in him as a new top guy.,Is it going to be in a closed arena? I hate open arenas.,i don't see it happening, he's too much of an established good guy for that to happen. the undertakers ""american bad ass"" phase was proof of what happens when you change a well established characters character.,Rock vs Cena vs Punk (Glorious Main Event),100 Undertakers vs 10 Bork Lasers,ADR vs Jack Swagger (Winner gets America)***,Ryback vs Shield (End the fucking feud),Kaitlyn vs AJ (Waifu Championship),Cesaro vs Orton (Make him fucking relevant),Woi vs Y2J (Make him fucking relevant),MONEY IN THE LEL MATCH: Beeg, Big E, Henry, Sheamus, Brodus, Tensai,Dark Match: Rhodes Scholars vs. Niggers (Kofi & Truth),(***Swagger almost gets the win, but Ziggles knocks him out, causes DQ, then cashes in),rick flair has been around alot recently, i believe it's the miz he's taken under his wing and taught him the secrets of the figure 4 leg lock.,OH SHIT, how could I miss out Khali in the lel match?,lel,:),ftfy,how could you mention miz but not sheamus,thx m8 ive got wooo too,Sheamus because Americans love the Irish for some reason.,It doesn't prove that. Look at Hulk Hogan turning heel & nWo.,Because the Irish aren't the British,#Brits #Heel4Lyfe,Mark Henry confirmed for taking Ryback and carrying him to the top of the Empire State Building model like King Kong, while Bryan and Kane try to stop him with biplanes,WWE needs more wrestlers,Among the things WWE needs, a larger roster is not one of those things,I'm just sick of the same faces,Fuck he slipped my mind. I could definitely see Sheamus as the guy even if I don't love him right now.,Sheamus is only 4 months younger than Cena, if they want to build someone up to be the main guy, I think they need to look younger. Much younger. Cena is 35 but he's been winning world titles for 8 years. Guys like Seth Rollins, Dean Ambrose, Roman Reigns and Big E Langston are all around the age Cena was.... Sheamus would be fine, but if they want to invest for the future, they could to put their faith in one of those guys,WWE are too conservative to slap a title on a young guy just like that. Sheamus himself had the fastest rise from debut to title win of the past several years, and really suffered in the long run from all of the precautions and safety nets they put up. It took a year and a half to be taken seriously as a main eventer after how shittily they booked him.,Kevin Nash once made a point of how youth movements aren't automatically a good thing, because young guys have less experience and haven;t paid their dues. He implied that putting a World title on someone before their early 30s was dodgy, since they wouldn't have ripened to their full main eventer potential yet. iI don't fully agree, but can see his point.,I could see Sheamus being a replacement Cena in the meantime though. He might be the same age, but he hasn't been wearing his body away on the gruelling WWE schedule for nearly as long and is a far fresher face to audiences. I wouldn't mind him carrying the company for a few years until Reigns, Rollins etc. come of age. Batista was 36 when he got his main event push and retired by 41.,They did do it to Cena when he was only 27, that's what annoys me. They've got ready-as-fuck rookies going to waste,The Rock needs to be facing Sheamus or... anybody else really.,Is that Cody Rhodes witha pornstache?,Yes, and it's over as fuck,Can't say the same for poor Cody,he reinvents himself with success all the time. just that sandow is really awesome too. ,Cant remember the last time he did a cartwheel though.,Good one.,Is that it?,Shit. It makes sense.,just cause it doesn't look bad doesn't mean it looks good,Rhodes hasnt had a single gimmick worth a damn. All of them have been beyond shit tier.,Worse then making Cesaro a yodeler.,You must be new here,naw 2000 wasnt that bad.,the hardcore free for all was fun, i cant remember anything else though.,maybe it was that bad,I reckon the card will go in this order:,PRE-SHOW: Antonio Cesaro actually has a match, probably v Kofi Kingston,Hell No v Zig-E,Ryback v Mizark,Del Rio v Swagger,Barrett v Miz,Lesnar vs HHH,Whatever the hell that Tensai/Brodus/Cody Rhodes/Sandow match is,Jericho v Fandango,Shield v Happy Smiling Face Bromance Team,Punk v Taker,Diddy performance,Rock v Cena,Likely candidate has to be Jericho/Fandango, but I can't see the mixed tag match going for long.,What a terrible card.

"Has anyone else on /asp/ done crew/rowing? I'm interested to see if anyone else here has done it. After seeing threads on frisbee golf, bouldering, and Quidditch, I'm sure there's a few of you lurking around.,Coxswain here. I did it for a couple years in college on our varsity men's team. Myself and half the team ended up quitting due to our coach getting replaced with a shitty one. Anyone have any fun rowing stories?,I guess I'll bump with an explanation on some of the shitty decisions that happened.,There was one girl who joined on as a cox about a month before I did, so she was considered more ""experienced"",She was not very good, either. She usually had trouble getting back into the dock.,Despite the fact that I was great at piloting and had never collided a shell with anything, she would be the one to cox our +4 in the Head of the Charles.,She crashed the shell into a fucking bridge,There was a thread earlier about it. Not sure how long it lasted though; last I saw was when I made a post about UK uni rowing.,Who did you row for, OP? Sounds like you had an extremely shitty coach. That, or your cox was sucking his cox.,Beat a team 1 on 1 by 45 seconds novice year. On my birthday. In downtown DC. Easily the most memorable race of my first year,I wouldn't doubt it, she was a huge slut.,Mass. Maritime,She was also a marine transportation major so she was in my classes. She dropped out from failing shit, probably because she couldn't navigate.,Our team wasn't amazing or anything. When we did a head we usually just aimed for doing better than coastguard and US Merchant Marine Academy,It definitely feels great to win. My novice year, the only time we ever hosted was a small regatta with four schools at the lake we practiced at. All the mens novices including myself got completely shitfaced the night before. One of my rowers even managed to shave his eyebrow off. We all had pretty bad hangovers until right before the races started, and we ended up sweeping the entire thing. My shell won by around 80 seconds.,Rower here, did it throughout highschool for Sarasota Crew. Best experience of my life I think, even though its pretty grueling... Fun rowing stories? Probably a race in Miami where mid 2k race, our 8+ skeg broke, boat was so off balance and swerving everywhere, somehow still managed first place in the race while pretty much ""drifting"" through the finish line. ,All the other teams faces where priceless when they found out we won, even with such equipment damage.,Also thinking about starting a rowing club for my uni, we are a small campus and our budget is huge for sports clubs. Perfect setting for such a sport as we are right on the water. (University of South Florida: St. Petersburg),Well this was high school rowing so we would have been suspended for getting shitfaced. I myself am not that great, major part of it is due to height because I'm only 5'9"". 2k or ended up being a 6:46 so not too terrible.,Forgot Pic,Rowing on the Thames in a quad with 3 novices.,Try to tell them how to scull. About to do a start and they somehow fuck up. Boat begins tipping over, before I can properly react to try and stablise the shell, we're over. I mistime my breath and take a huge gulp of dirty Thames water, which is probably about 90% sewage. First and only time I've ever been in a flipped boat.,I've never used so much antiseptic on my open blisters and cuts on my calves from the runners.,A few months later, former Olympian (gold medalist), died from Weil's disease, that he'd contracted from the same stretch of the Thames.,Oh, don't get me wrong. We were a dry campus. We were basically being retarded and breaking several regiment rules. From practices the few days before we knew our times were great and we had it in the bag. Looking back I know it was reckless, but I still think it was awesome how badly we beat the other schools. I remember puking 15 minutes before getting on the water and suddenly feeling like a million bucks.,You should do it. My school pumped most of its pathetic athletics budget into our shitty football team was still able to afford having us around.,I've been fortunate to never been flipped. There were a few times I saw my teammates flip other shells, though.,Yeah, fuck that. Might as well get slapped by 50 dicks.,Rowing seems like a really intimidating sport.,I row for my college club team,Novice pleb reporting,It is a very exhausting sport that uses most of your body. Not to mention you have to be paying enough attention while rowing yourself to death to follow the coxswain's orders and stay in time with the other rowers. If you don't you are guaranteed to catch an oar handle to the back. You are unable to escape until everyone stops.,I can already hear the profanities,I haven't had it happen yet, granted I've only been in two races,you don't want to ever.,We had one rower that was a little overweight, but had full t-rex mode legs. His form got absolutely terrible once he started getting tired and always ending up digging, catching crabs during practice, and ruining the set of the boat. I think he got one during a race, too. I wasn't coxing that boat so I don't remember.,He could push like a motherfucker, but he wasn't even one of the strongest rowers on our novice squad. No one really wanted him in their boat and always resented his presence.,You don't want to be that guy. Strength and endurance are probably most important, but your form can't be too sloppy.,OP here, by the way. Was surprised to see this bumped. I remember some things I disliked were some boats being based solely on erg scores. Guys like this that can pull a ripcord really hard, but can't do a proper stroke don't belong in the best boat when it's time for the regatta.,i have seen 3 rowing threads already on /asp/ finally there is a place for our sport.,i'm feeling good because i just did a 2k pb and its HORR this weekend,There was nothing stopping us before. I've seen rowing threads on /sp/ and /fit/ in the past, though they tended to be rather short.,I'm the one who made the Olympics rowing threads last Summer, if anyone remembers those. I was glad those were successful threads.,Good luck at HORR too. From what I've heard, this year should be quite tight at the top with regards to university rowing.,What part of the Thames was this? I never capsized, but the Tideway is fucking dreadful.,Best story? Racing on the Clyde in a 4+ when our novice (novice novice so fucking novice) cox crashed us and the bow man lost his footplate -- for the majority of the race I was the only one on bow side and we still made seven overtakes and came second in our division, beaten only by an older and taller team.,Around the milepost/harrod's.,That's horrendous for currents, I don't understand why anyone would put novices out there.,Oh wow, I am so glad to see this board. Obviously rowing threads could be made before in /sp/, but /sp/ always seemed for much more mainstream sports. Im currently a rower on a pretty good college team, my freshman boat ranked top 10 in the country last spring, which I was pretty proud of. We went ALMOST undefeated, but lost in our second to last race of the season. That was the most frustrating thing ever, but the next week we came back and kicked the same team's ass.,rowed in high school. made the top eight there as 6 seat.,it was fucking grueling to say the least. trained about 10x a week to come last at our penultimate race. but would totally do it again it a heartbeat, made some real bros after 5 years of rowing. something about sharing that pain with others makes them int your pals.,i found that after high school, rowing became less about teamwork and camaraderie and more about self-interested peeps. didn't appeal to me so i quit. i still coach at my old high school and its fun, but i would not ever consider going elite, even though ive been told many times that if i had the cardio, i could be rowing at least state level,Don't even get me started. I wish I'd been in a launch at the time instead or something, because it would have been hilarious to see. I think the only thing that could best a quad going over would be an eight.,Are you at an Ivy League university? Did you get spanked by Washington? If so, I refer you to this ,Pretty much this, the only time I've seen a rowing thread in /sp/ that wasn't spammed out of existence was last year's boat race.,also /sp/ are horribly elitist about their sports and if you mention a sport that isnt football or handegg you will most likely be told to gtfo,I'm in one of the uni boats in my first year at one of the top universities, i cant wait for this, its the only think that makes the 60 minute ergos worth it..,Yeah but not exactly ""fun"" though.,A couple months ago I was racing at bow in an Intermediate 8 at a head in our club's empacher. It was the first race that our main rivals were racing at so we had to make an impression. We got to the start line a good bit before the start of the race so decided to turn and do a couple of bursts. Towards the end of our second burst I hear a shout from behind me. I turn round and see a four facing the wrong direction under a bridge, about twenty feet directly ahead of us. Our boat was going pretty much top speed, so before we could react we had hit them Our bow hit around their stroke seat, and I got one hell of a smack in the back from their blade. I turn round and see our bow burred in the side of their boat, the actual bow itself was broken off and sitting on the stroke man's legs, covered in blood. He was sitting there screaming as the three man was trying to help him stop the bleeding. We got him into the safety launch and the boats into the side. the race was delayed by about 20 minutes and the boats were towed down to the finish after the race, that's when we saw just how much damage had been done. we were missing about 3 feet of our bow. The injured stroke man had a torn muscle and a two inch deep gash filled with carbon from the boats.,Im so tired right now but im going out to do my 20k paddle today. just so i can hit my target of 300k in one month,captcha usecolf muscle,damn right im gonna use my calf muscles,I'm going to assume either UL, Durham or IC?,I'm certain that you're not from Newcastle, because we tended to do more multiples of short pieces (e.g. 15x 2KM, r22 and r26 alternating) when I was a senior there, rather than something like 1 hour of steady state ergs, which were relatively rare and probably only popped up once, maybe twice a week.,Then again, my memories are getting fuzzy.,To add:,http://archive.foolz.us/sp/search/s,I'm not at an Ivy, so we weren't technically ranked, but we handily beat a team that had beaten an Ivy ranked team the week before who was ranked #10. United States, by the way, forgot to mention that. Just got back from my first practice of the day. While all my friends are in Florida and Cancun and such places, I'm in New England in freezing weather doing nothing but rowing. Ah well, it's all worth it in the end.,That's one thing I always found funny about rowing at a decent level. Not only would you be expected to sacrifice your time during term, you're also expected to arrive before a term starts and leave after term finishes. ,It's another aspect that helps reinforce the cammeraderie within rowing.,It isn't a downvote, you moron. The sage is for me, not the thread. It's my way of adding onto my previous post (which is why I said ""to add"") without bumping the thread again.,If you have nothing to actually contribute to a rowing thread, please grow up and pick another thread to shit up with your ""hurr, sage is le downboat, y u seg?"" rhetoric.,I've always felt like the amount of work that has to be done in order to be even a decent amount successful is so inflated compared to other sports.,I blame the East Germans. ,From what I know and have heard about rowing history, they're the ones who started the whole training 14+ times a week malarkey and that culture soon spread around the world in order to compete with them. This is ignoring the systematic doping of teams behind the iron curtain.,Of course it eventually filters down to the grassroots level as people who want to break into the national teams have to train as much. Then, to be remotely competitive at any level, you have to bust your balls too because again, everyone else is training that much.,Another thing that doesn't help is that rowing is still a sprint sport for the most part, so you have to go all out from the get-go. You obviously need the endurance to be able to sprint for that long, so there's another reason for the long hours. If rowing regattas were only 500m, or even 1KM, things would be completely different. Same goes the other way, I guess (10KM+).,I can see how 500m would be different because in my region we have some fast races of 500m and 1k. ,But making a 10k race would not change the sprint thing about rowing. ,The boat race is a 6k race, do you see them more relaxed?,The boat race is an exception, rather than the rule. That is one of the only races where you will find teams racing that distance at a 2k rate. And that extra 4k goes a long ways to inducing fatigue. Besides, the men rowing in the boat race are absolute monsters that have the fitness to be able to pull something like that off. 99% of other rowers out there are incapable of keeping power and form at a 2k rate for a 6k distance, let alone a 10k.,Yes, I almost agree with that. ,The boat race is a exception? yes it is,World class rowers couldn't make 6k in the same intensity of a 2k race? Many of them can...,You can just watch Eric Murray making one hour at 1:37 split or see the record of 2k and 6k at the ergo machine...,I can see the strategy changing if the races last 10k, but not the intensity of the race,That's part of the reason why I plugged in a + at the end of 10KM. How about an extension on that. Let's say, 30KM+, so we're going into half-marathon distances and more.,That's why I said 99% of rowers. Maybe that's not the exact ratio. The point is, I meant the vast majority. Sports don't exist for only the very highest caliber of athletes. I agree with your last point though. You still try your hardest, just over a longer period of time.,It is a shame though. Because the local club we train at hates us. We get next to no coaching what so ever but there's still a few of us that continue to train despite this. We'll come last again at BUCS.,Yes, but liking or not the other 99% aim their pratice to this 1% of big thoughts guys,Yes, I think a half-marathon would be a low pace and real strengh,It depends where you live, really. When I was at Newcastle, I was surprised how many people rowed and the different backgrounds people at the local clubs came from. Yeah, the sport does tend to be more popular among public schools in affluent areas that have both the funding to run a boat club, but I think there is a bigger dependence on what is in the area. ,Somewhere that's in the centre of the country, like Sheffield, I imagine, would be complete and utterly fucked. But if you pick somewhere where there is a good stretch of water, like Newcastle, rowing is much more accessible.,You go to Leeds or something, don't you? Still, got to admire your enthusiasm. I was like rowing's battered wife. He'd come wake me up in the morning, beat me and do the same in the evening, every single day and I'd just come crawling back.,The best can definitely pull off those 6ks at 2k race. ,However, most rowers can't. Our good Coach would talk strategy individually with myself and the other cox's to plan out stroke rate and power to properly pace the specific rowers in our boats.,Despite this I had some cases where I still had trouble keeping some rowers from tiring out. I could correct improper stroke rate, but it's hard to tell if there are rowers rowing too hard if there's an equal number of port and starboard rowers doing it.,Ha sorta. I go to Teesside. I'm using the training we do among ouselves to get ready for when I transition to do Gig Rowing down south. Funny How I enjoy rowing despite me being from a powerlifting/rugby background.,I find that a lot of rowers who pick it up at uni are former rugby players, who get into it for whatever reason. It's the same with me and a lot of others who joined when I was a novice.,Back when I was rowing women's fours in boarding school I was involved in a very nearly deadly capsizing event. Basically, we were rowing on a river flooded with ice-melt in early spring and it was gusty as hell--whitecaps and all. I was stroking port, we were having a shite practice, and then our coach's launch engine cut out and he abandoned us for shore with directions to bring it in. Our dock was sort of diagonal out into the river and the current was against us, with a strong headwind. We missed the first attempt, and on the second approach the port oars caught the killer current too deep and the starboard oars essentially caught wind and in a flash, over we went to the port side. Now, no one had ever thought to give us instructions of what to do in the event like this, so we all struggled for air before remembering the quick-release velcro straps on our shoes. Well, we in the stern pair did. As we swam out form under the foundering shell, the boat drifted to shore and our oars became tangled in the mess of roots and vines there, trapping us between. Neither of us could swim to the bow pair to save them, and watched in horror as the girl in the bow actively drowned in front of us. Luckily, we were able to somehow flip the shell back over with her STILL TIED IN. No one noticed this happening until we began screaming bloody murder over the wind and the other coach's engine.,We had been in the water for at least 8 minutes before the bow pair and cox were picked up and taken to shore. My pair and I were left to haul ourselves (and each other) ashore, using only our arms because hypothermia had begun to set into our legs and feet. We were probably 100 meters downriver from the boathouse and had to sprint through the woods barefoot and soaking wet to reach the team. There was so much adrenaline coursing through my body, I didn't feel the sharp gravel on my feet, I didn't hear anything but a loud rushing in my ears, and I had total tunnel vision. They stripped us down and dithered over whether or not to take us to the hospital, where we were eventually treated for shock and early-onset hypothermia. I arrived at the hospital in a windbreaker with a hand-towel wrapped around my waist. Needless to say, the girl who nearly nearly died quit rowing shortly thereafter.,I'd rather not say which one im at because my coach doesn't like us chatting about it online but its one of the top 5 unis in the draw. we do lots of low rate mileage in our training.,No worries. It was the same when I was at Newcastle. As mentioned, I'm not there any more, so I'm not too fussed about mentioning some of the things we did; it was pretty common knowledge anyway since it contrasts to traditional British rowing coaching. ,I'll stick with my previous assumption, but swapping Durham out with Brookes. If you were at Durham, you'd know Isley from /fit/ and that'd be rather weird - small world though. I won't dig any further anyhow. ,I might actually be around the area come HORR, but only as a spectator. Still, best of luck anyway.,At my uni every freshman did basic safety and water survival training, so they didn't need to tell us shit and we were given no instruction by our coaches. I kind of assumed every other crew team at least went through some sort of safety briefing. After all, isn't safety the most important aspect of any sport? I assumed we were just an exception because everyone at the school already knew what to do.,However, looking back I realize we probably weren't. Our two coaches were pretty much ignorant about every aspect of our uni that wasn't the crew team. ,Naturally there was emphasis put on not flipping the shell, but I think that was pretty much it. Besides that there was just an unspoken ""We'll just save you if you're not dead by the time the launch gets to you, however long that takes"",Is it common among rowing that water survival goes uninstructed?,All we ever did was a swim test and told that if you ever flip, unstrap as quickly as possible and either swim to the nearest bank, or hold onto the shell until the launch can rescue you.,I cheated on a part of my swim test as the pool we treaded water in wasn't that deep and I could touch the floor. I can swim, but can't tread water for more than 40 seconds, lel.,so who is sub 6:40 2k here?,I've always been like that. Not to that extent, but a similar idea. I am an exceptional swimmer when we're talking about speed, but when it came to my swim test I had a fair amount of trouble.,Pulled 6:27 a couple weeks back. It would've been significantly faster but I was a lazy shit this winter and this past summer I was out for a month and a half with sickness/injury.,pretty good, pretty good. where are you from?,US, Connecticut. Pretty good area to be as far as competitive rowing goes.,6:32 from when I still rowed. A couple of the guys in my club were sub-6 and in the GBR U23 setup and a few other trialists. Other people in the top boats fell in after that. I was at the lower end of the senior squad.,Doubt I could even break sub-7 these days.,michigan here. pulled 6:19.8 at CIRC this year,6.33 at 74 kilos,I can barely swim 50 meters,That's pretty good for someone who's almost a lightweight. Guessing you're down to 72.5KG for race season?,I thought about lightweight b but here in the UK unless you are trialling for international no one cares about lightweight. ,I naturally sit at around 75 kilos (186 cm so a bit tall foot lwt) so i'm going to go heavy weight and try and get under 6.25 by the regatta season.,Fuck, sorry /fit/ I found a new home board,my problem is that im a little on the heavy side, so even though i am the second fastest on my team im only in the middle of the pack weight adjusted,Fair enough. I started out around LW as a novice (naturally weighed around 71KG), bulked myself up to 89KG over time and now dropped back down to 83KG where I sit quite comfortably these days. Same with the height thing as well, I'm 184cm, which is pretty shitty seeing as I weigh more than a lightweight but my height isn't great for open weight. ,Sometimes I wish there was a middleweight category. Rowing is one of the few sports where I rue genetics.,I'm sure you know the age old saying: ergs don't float. You are an example of why ergs aren't the be-all and end-all.,tfw can't erg because of a shoulder injury yet can row harder than anyone else in my crew,This is not a fucking sport, nor an alternative sport.,Take it to ,.,This board is primarily for wrestling and skateboarding.,Deal with it.,You rode a pretty short bus didn't you,I might do dragonboating in the summer, is it remotely similar to what this thread is about?,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon,same themes, minus the leg power. If you got really good you would look like those Olympic kayakers,Who cares, he's a blatant troll who has spammed several threads with the same thing. Just ignore it.,Not very similar but really fun.the cannot club near my boat coin did one and I joined in,it was a laugh,Rowed for my college at Cambridge last year. Was fun, we did alright at bumps (look it up if not familiar). ,I quit because I hate team sports lol,im from dc as well. which school did you row for?,anyone else here from dc that did crew?,Fellow coxwain here,I just use a rowing machine because I'm too much of an autist to go outside or use a gym.,I fucking love it.,From what I've seen of bumps racing, it looks hilarious, mainly because of the lower standard and ruined Empachers that I've seen.,I remember seeing one video where some cox managed to steer the boat into the bank like a moron, another crew looking for the bump went in and crashed into the boat and then a third boat decided to go in for bump and basically the strokeside oars just clattered everyone in the second boat.,You'd learn to hate it if you actually rowed. I used to think the same.,Have to agree, ergs are horrible.,You know what I hated? When you'd wake up in the morning, looking forward to an early water session only to get a text from your coach or captain saying the conditions at the boathouse are too bad. So instead of a glorious 2 hours on the water, it's 2 hours of ergs or something.,Every time that would happen, it felt like Satan was defecating in my mouth.,Same goes being told that 2K tests were coming up.,Last spring I was being seat raced and I beat a guy who had a 2k over 10 seconds faster than me by over 10 seconds on a thousand meter piece. Monday morning I did something similar, although it wasn't an official seat race. I don't whether I have a horrible mental block on the ergs or if my stroke is really just that good, but every time I've been seat raced it's the same story.,A part of that could be the fact that you're looking at the screen and therefore your split times. It can have a psychological effect when you're not hitting the times you want. Whereas in a seat race, it's a different kettle of fish.,Also, ergs don't float, you probably have better technique, etc.,it's even worse if you're the cox.,Disagree.,We just ran, I'd much rather erg. Or the coach would cancel it, but only text us like five minutes before when I'd already spent half an hour on a train and 20 minutes walking to get there.,Yeah I always hate that, you clear the time for the training in your planning for the day and then end up standing next to ergs with the only other viable option is just joining them.,I can respect that you disagree with me. Training on the water is all around better for everyone. ,Sound like you had it rough with the canceled practices, though. We had our ergs in the athletic center on our campus and he would just meet us there before we got in the vans(which were parked right next to the gym),Did it at 6th form. Loved it, got fit, went to Nat Schools and came 4th in some 4+ category (first year rowing), went tankard hunting and stuff in my second year of 6th form. Very excited to start it at uni.,And then I got there and couldn't stand it. Didn't get along with the people very well at all. Now I just lift.,If I could change one thing about my rowing in the past it would have been to lift more and lift properly - something along the lines of starting strength, lots of squats, dead lifts and power cleans. I think my crew[s] would have done a lot better if we had.,My crew lifts once or twice every week.,So did ours, but it was pretty chicken shit lifting. Lots of nautilus machines, wasn't really structured at all.,Ah, well we've got the luck that we have a professional trainer for the lifting to help my boys (I cox),What kind of lakes did you used to row? Tiny or big ones? Did you had to share the space with speedboats and other shit?,its mostly that it attracts and keeps the kind of people who aren't phased by the sport having literally no redeeming qualities,i did it for 4 years,i guess if it did have a redeeming quality it would be that being on the water is nice,however, it's not fun, it's bad for your knees, it requires a ton of muscle memory and skill, but the act of getting better at it has no feedback and it's hard to tell if you're doing it right. It's often cold, it's grueling, you're repeatedly doing an unnatural motion, unlike running,I don't know why I kept at it so long. Camaraderie maybe. So many better sports.,Looks like tripniggers are already shitting up this board after barely a few days' age. lel.,I just got really interest the way you row that jurt your knee.,Depending on the week's load, we'd lift anywhere from 3-6 times a week. It'd usually be 7 exercises and it would be squats, deads, cleans, bench, rows, etc.,Rivers.,Sounds like shit technique and coaching to be honest.,My college club team is limited to a man-made lake that is roughly 2 kilos from one end to the other. The only other people that use it are townies with small fishing boats. And the ""women's"" team. The length sucks but the water is calm as fuck.,I asked that because my rowing club is on a big lake. In the same lake we have sailor practice, fishing and rowing, some days we have to deal with big waves,shit like ,lake 3k across was. There was like some day camp with a tiny bit of access to the lake and the rest was mostly residential. There was one pontoon boat that was always anchored at one end. We never saw anyone use it.,And since it was close to the ocean, it was windy as fuck. There were plenty of days where it was just too rough for us to get out there. ,The only other people we ever saw on the lake were the sailing team in their little freshwater dinghies. They mostly just sailed around one area, though. We went to the lake a lot more often then they did.,The river I used to row on is tidal and can get rather choppy at times. We used about a 30KM stretch. Fortunately, there wasn't much traffic.,Sometimes we trained at Strathclyde Park, which is a manmade lake specifically designed to be a world-class rowing lake. Except they cleared all the trees near it for other parky things so there was a constant massive crosswind. Shit was awful in regattas, you couldn't stay in position at the start for more than a few seconds.,By god I loved our river though -- it was basically still (but full of tiny undercurrents) and narrow and full of sharp corners so when we raced it we had a huge home advantage.,At least you have a river, I'm in Edinburgh now and we've got beautiful bridges travelling over a fucking train station, it's unnatural. Who builds a city on a firth?,I always thought Edinburgh was a bit fucking weird. Beautiful, but weird. Now it all makes sense.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmsz,Any east coast rowers gonna be a Dad Vail this year?,Why, America. Why?,I cox SA-status rowers so I guess I'm getting close to that level?,My team's pretty much got that drive and spirit, but not the big dudes that UW has. Drop our erg scores about 10-15 seconds on average and we'd be right there.,This video is kind of scary. Both,Just to throw this in for the sake of it, UW v Cambridge from a few weeks ago http://vimeo.com/59950122,http://theboatrace.org/men/news-art,Yep. I mean, there's a reason many of those guys go on to the olympics.,One thing I do find funny about , is that you can clearly see the Canadian influence in their coaching. All that leanback on those ergs.,Let's just hope that this year is a close one for a change.,Also, HORR has just been cancelled due to weather.,I mean you can take the rowing styles of any major rowing countries and be successful with it. Anyways, if you watch video of their actual rowing they don't have nearly the layback that the Canadians do. Must be just an erging thing for them.,Not surprised. It's pretty fucking horrendous down here in London. Would not want to be on the Tideway.,Guys, i want to get into rowing. ,What are the height/weight requirements?,Don't be stupidly fat and don't be stupidly short. Most of the major height/weight requirements are only a factor if you're trying to be competitive with the sport. As far as that goes, over 6 feet tall is generally a rule, although there are a handful of very successful rowers under 6'. As far as weight, trim as much fat away as possible. There's no good number here as it depends entirely on the person, but my team has guys ranging anywhere from 170-210 and we have maybe 2 guys under 6 feet tall. We're also very competitive, so take that with a grain of salt. Obviously if you're a girl, just tone down those numbers a few inches and pounds.,Stupidly short is fine aswell, due to coxing being more awesome than rowing anyway.,Aside from the naivety of that comment, I was assuming that he wanted to row, seeing as he said he wanted to get into rowing.,Well I'm currently 5'7-5'8, [spoiler] 17 years old[/spoiler] and I want to get into this after highschool since my highschool doesn't have this sport and I'm a little short currently. ,I like the competitiveness of rowing and the endurance strength aspect. Currently a swimmer. Just hoping to be able to a club or go for college. Coxing doesn't look fun because there's no physical movement.,also I'm in Washington State. Is this a good place to be for this sport?,There's a good portion of my club team that are former swimmers. They do far better than me (former divegrass player). Not to mention I also took two years off from competitive sports before getting into crew. ,How much do you weigh?,Coxing is only fun if you really, really enjoy freezing your ass off.,I used to wear long underwear, jeans, sweatsuit, tracksuit over that, scarf, gloves, and watchcap.,Still froze my fucking ass off all spring unless it was completely sunny, which was never.,Needless to say, coxing isn't fun at all.,Yeah West and East coast have good youth rowing competition. Join a boat club that wins races, it's gonna be expensive but it'll set you up nice. UW won every event they entered in at IRAs last year, so you lucked out on a College location.,I row in college.,I love the damn sport, but competing at this level is really wearing me down. I have other goddamn priorities and when you're training 11x a week it's nearly impossible. Academics take a backseat to MOVING THE BOAT. You get dirty looks if you couldn't do a second workout because you had a project. But then if you don't do the work,do the workouts and get low grades, you get bitched at by the academic advisors and the coaches!,It's the best and worst thing ever. The bonds I've made with my teammates is amazing and I'll never have another group of brothers like this.,I beg to differ, the cold doesnt seem to bother me at all once I'm in the boat and busy.,Sweet, well I'm from a poorish family so I wont do it during highschool, I'm also about 100 miles north of Seattle. ,Yeah doesn't seem fun at all. ,I'm pretty light. 125lbs 7-8% bf. I was 7% in swim but I'm just lifting weights right now trying to gain some weight and muscle. I really hope I get a good Growth Spurt, and it's highly likely since my dad is 6'6. But alas my mom is only 4'11 so who knows.,When was the last time you coxed in sub freezing temperatures, as most competitive crews practice in?,One of the things about rowing is time management. If you can mange your time properly, it is well within your ability to get the top grades you want/need. But you have to be strict; basically every hour not devoted to rowing or rowing socials, should be study.,Depending on how much you grow you could get into lightweight rowing as well. I knew a cox who was about 5'10 who got into lightweight rowing after a few years of coxing.,Former varisty swimmer here.,It's like that for every varsity sport. Learn to live exhausted or get out. Be prepared to sacrifice a relationship or two, a few letter grades etc. ,Every coach on the continent will tell you academics come first up until the point you miss a practice, then they get pissed and blame you for shitty time management. Except the few insane ones who demand you take 3 classes a semester, do 5 years for your degree and always prioritize sports over school i.e. U of Ottawa Swimming,Yesterday, due to today being slightly over 0c,Did anyone watch the first world cup of the season in Sydney, yesterday? ,GBR laying the smack down, as per (with a partial development squad). Even if barely anyone else turned up.,Captain of my uni team, got some rowing points (British) Senior A rower, IM2 sculler, gonna tear it up in Chile next year,Any nz rowers here who just got back from maadi cup? It was my last season and i am already missing it :-(,Washington rower here. It's nice.,Real nice.,I was in that boat....,struggling with the mental side of erging last week or so, just seems to be totally destroying me, any tips for breaking through a shit spell?,Honestly you just have to work through it. It happens to everyone, just gotta deal with it until you break the wall again.,do a 20Km, it will kill the boy inside you,20k isn't really all that much for most serious athletes. And the only thing a really long erg session is going to do for him is screw with his head more.,I haven't rowed since High School and even then I was pretty shitty. I'm 19 1/2 right now and I really want to start rowing for my university in August so I need to get in shape. This is me in summer 2011. I really miss rowing though man. Most/least fun I've ever had. My uni is tough so, fuck.,doing what? Sitting still and talking?,I would slide down as far into the bow as possible while still being able to see and it still doesn't do much good.,Anyone had a go on one of the concept II dynamics? What do you make of it?,I can't quite get used to it just yet, seems difficult to get as much compression as I'm used to from the static.,My team has a bunch of them. The reason that it feels difficult to get as much compression is because most of the time people compress on stationary ergs far more than you would in a boat. Dynamics do a good job of forcing you to imitate the form that you would use in a boat. That being said, I don't care for them because the lack of any significant bungee force to pull back on the cord makes your shoulders get stupidly tired., That was you guys? That was hilarious.,I talked to the Mass Maritime coach my junior year of HS, I ended up taking a year off instead of going to college but I was still thinking about going to Mass Maritime. I rowed all through high school,I knew i would find a rowing thread on /b/ :D,I row for my school In NZ and recently went to maadi where i rowed our clubs best boat (a fillipi we had only got late last year/ early this year) and the skeg broke at 1300 just before our wind :( we had a real chance at gold....,i have a dynamic erg and i wouldnt recommend it. if you have the space get a static and buy some sliders for it. This gives you the best of both worlds. ,I found it also gave me really tired shoulders and slower splits at low rate and faster splits at high rate. on a static i am at 2k: 6.33, 30 minutes at rate 20 1.48.5 split but on the dynamic my 2k is faster by 2 seconds and my 30@20 split is 1 second slower,Man up.,Nice little 15k erg this morning. Looking forward to the boatrace, Oxford will surely take it.,I tried rowing a few years ago but I found sailing to be more enjoyable and just as competitive >,Oxford will win unless some bullshit like

"Bringing Medieval Swordplay to the masses, share your WMA, MARE & HEMA content.,What?! is this a thing? I've always wanted to spar with a short sword and shield like a western alternative to kendo. Anyone do it in the california bay area?,Does iaido count?,Was that actually practiced as a serious discipline? I realize the intent is to strike and re sheathe the sword in a single motion, but was it used say in duels?,Got already a HEMA thread here ,Sword and Buckerl it is called: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7bh,Buckler , sorry for the typo.,""Stop trying to make MARE a thing."",Kind of like 'Chivalric Arts'. It's almost as painful as when people refer to surviving manuscripts as 'manuals', or to a 'German Tradition'.,/pedant.,Whats MARE?,Fucking lol'd iai-do way of the iai, so basically it's not for fighting.,If your talking of iai-jutsu (technic of drawing the sword) now it's fucking dangerous, there is a famous story of Miyamoto Musashi which is said as the best swordman of the world who defeated a iai-jutsu master only with ruse because he thought it was too dangerous to attack him as his sword was sheathed.,Also I think Hema is funny but as there is no continuity in the practice, I don't see the interest in reviving this tradition as most of the people don't know how to handle a sword.,Martial Arts of Renaissance Europe. A term exclusively used by John Clements, an American who runs a creepy cult organisation called ARMA (The Association for Renaissance Martial Arts).,""Chivalric Arts"" and ""The Art"" etc. are terms that I've heard banded about by people who enjoy wearing plate armour, and I don't actually understand what they mean by that.,The rest of the world runs with HEMA - historical European Martial Arts. Some people also use WMA (Western Martial Arts) to refer to martial arts that still have a living lineage, like some sabre systems, catch wrestling or modern puglisim, as well as martial arts that originated outside of Europe but aren't asian, like bowie knife fighting.,You might also come across Historical Fencing, or Historical Swordsmanship. Which are pretty understandable and have slightly different associations.,I think so. Many of the older Japanese schools of swordsmanship which were founded when people still used the weapons teach it, so it definitely had some value.,Not entirely. I think it's more about unsheathing the sword fast and defending oneself, e.g. in a self-defence situation when you're attacked on the street, obviously you'd only sheathe your sword after you're done. Also, there's a surprising amount of techniques about cutting down an opponent sitting in front of you; apparently, the Japanese had to worry quite a bit about sneaky attacks while being served tea, signing documents, etc.,No, in a duel both participants would have their weapons drawn, at least if it was something regulated and official.,There's a bit of a myth, mostly due to anime glorifying the whole thing, that this was some special technique and people would sheathe their sword in battle to unleash some extra fast sword drawing on their opponent, but this is obviously nonsense. These teachings were meant to prepare people so they could defend themselves while not expecting an attack and not having their weapon readied. Obviously someone with a weapon drawn is in a better situation than someone who has it sheathed, and the idea that sheathing a weapon or drawing it from a sheath somehow makes it faster than attacking with an already drawn weapon is complete nonsense of course.,It's not about striking faster, it's about striking at the right place at the right moment.,It's about not having to think before correctly reacting i.e. reflexes. In this way, it is a lot like touch typing.,You're just showing your ignorance about japanese martial arts.,Why, whats wrong with what he said?,just like you show yours towards HEMA right?,Weeaboos gonna weeb.,I may be eight steps from hachidan, but I have trained both kendo and iaido for a bit, even tried jodo at one point, and I have been doing a bit of reading on the side too. Yet with that background, he appears to be the one talking sense, whereas if you have anything more solid behind you than popular fiction, well, you certainly haven''t waved it around.,This is my first time on this board and it's a serious question. Are there any institutions that teach medeival europian swordsmanship? Also I've recently started practicing serrada eskrima if anyone have any tips or recs I would appreciate it.,I wouldn't say it like that. I've been doing BattoJutsu for a while now and also attended a few Iaido trainings; and while they pay much more attention to perfect accuracy and it feels a bit like meditation, the basic techniques are very similar to the ones in BattoJutsu.,Someone who just trains Iaido will lack the experience of actual combat situations, but it's not like their parries and cuts couldn't be used for a serious fight.,Yeah, whatever, please fuck off and open a Iado thread then, this thread is about European swordsmanship. TVM,Sure, theres a couple hundred groups and schools around the globe that teach HEMA. Care to tell us where you're from?,Istanbul, Turkey. If you point me to a direction it would be great but if there was a school that teach HEMA around my town I would've heard about it,As I said before Iai-do is oriented toward the zen practice of martial arts as unusable to a battlefield today, martial arts are seen as a way to improve oneself. The aim is not to be a machine but to achieve the mushin (no-mind) where you're present, know what you have to do without thoughts, without fear, in the west we talk about it as ""the zone"".,That's why all martial ARTS with a -do have roots in the martial TECHNIQUE but are not focused on being efficient at killing or staying alive.,Now martial arts with -jutsu are designed to be efficient at killing/staying alive so comparing those so-called HEMA, whose transmission of techniques are solely based on books and guesses not actual combat/master, to -jutsu martial arts would be more accurate.,Hence before rejecting eastern martial arts as being ""weebo stuff"" you should learn the basics about it as it is the only continent which has kept a solid transmission of those antique martial arts.,tl:dr fuck off weaboo faggot and get your own damn thread.,http://www.kuzgunakademi.com/,Only one in Instanbul, next group would be Izmir. Wouldn't know about the quality of their training, but since they are almost alone in Turkey you don't have that much of a choice either.,Typical Hema guy,SKUNKS tournament registration is out: http://www.vectir.pl/skunks,In order to catch the right moment you'd have to be fast enough though. In any case, the idea that unsheathing a sword somehow made it faster or having your sword sheathed gave you a tactical advantage over someone who has his sword drawn is obviously utter nonsense.,It was really rare, and only as a last resort when used. ,The form that you usually see isn't what was used. Usually, the sheath and the sword were removed from the hip, held in the left hand, and drawn with the right in an upward diagonal motion in an attempt to counter an attacking swordsman by slashing at his arms. ,Iaido is only practiced as a ceremonial set of movements in memory of encounters that famous Samurai actually had. One could never employ said movements in combat after studying only Iaido.,Some apologies to the HEMA side here, but as the previous thread seems to be doing aright still...,Utter nonsense.,If you have the time for this, just draw your sword and be done with it, leaving the saya where it is. The diagonal upwards cut comes naturally as we move from katana to tachi, but it's certainly possible with a katana too, and that without having to pull the saya out of your belt. You'll see it in ZNKR kata #5: www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ5_JaRaOtQ,bumpenhau for later use.,you seem a lil upset there naruto,Nope just sad for hema guys, but whatever.,Don't worry about us Naruto, we don't worry about you either.,P.S. on a side note, comming back and spamming our threads is not actually a sign of not giving a fuck (guess you even gonna answer this one...),While we are at it, there was a Kenjutsu workshop at the SKUNKS 2012 event,The instructor later fought an exihibition match against Maciej Talaga, vid related: ,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1d,I'll be lurking the hell out of this.,check the other thread then, 200+ more answers.,Which other thread?

"/k/ is for redneck gun-nuts, and /tg/ is for neckbeards.,Is this finally a place I can talk about Western martial arts with?,I personally would love somewhere to talk about swords and ACTUAL swordfighting, without any RPG or Kill Bill bullshit.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC1,Just one question about samurai, knights, whatever, fights.,It is true that the swords clashed often in the fights?,Depends a lot on the fighting style, culture and equipment being used. Viking swords almost never touched, because the shield took care of defense, but later medieval longswords had more involved parrying with the blade. Watch a bit of the video posted, it's a pretty good example.,this might be a tad bit more pathetic than katana weeboos,The problem I have with Western martial arts (besides there are no place around to do it around here) is that it is mostly informal speculation based on a few old manuscripts and some sparing. It would be like reconstructing Ninjutsu using only the Bansenshukai and some speculative sparing. ,There is little evidence that there was even a formalized system for combat for most weapons and for most of European history. Most of it was mostly form up; push forward; stab and slash the other guys; try not to die. I would even argue that it is not a ""real"" martial art just as I would argue that ""jedi fighting styles"" are not a real martial art.,How so? There's no mythic or spiritual bullshit going on here. No worship of a bygone era that never actually happened. We just like swords and fighting with them.,http://www.wiktenauer.com/,You're pretty wrong there. There was absolutely a formalized system, several in fact, and the were MUCH more in-depth than ""push forward and stab."" (Except for the Romans, that is literally all they did.) The reason it was lost isn't because there wasn't a record of it, it's because unlike Japan there wasn't any spiritual weight given to swords and swordfighting traditions, so when swords stopped being commonly used, swordfighting stopped being taught.,PRAISE THE LORD. A place one could finally talk about this would be nice. Anyone have some favorite Fechtbuchs/manuals? Or know of any underappreciated ones?,Swordfags be jelly of mah long ass reach nigguh,Aww yeee pollaxes,I do not see how what I said is pretty wrong. It is ""MOSTLY"" informal speculation based on ""A FEW"" old manuscripts and some sparing.,The ""push forward and stab"" speaks to what was actually and historically used in real conflicts and wars and not what was used in highly formalizes affairs such as trial by combat, dueling, or blood sport. ,It would be like arguing that pro wrestling is a martial art or that Jedi fighting is a martial art. ,Not all combat systems qualify are martial arts.,The bits/edges of two weapons are not supposed to touch in any situation where an edged weapon is going to be used in defense against another, IE, not shield-fighting or blunt weapons.,If two swordsmen are blocking each other's blows with the edge, rather than the flat, they're a pair of fucktards.,Smashing edges against edges has the predictable effect of blunting the weapons.,Usually, neither swordsman wants his sword's edge fucked up.,not always true in fact many of the binds require edge on edge to a degree but your right its not just smashing edges,I LOVE and I mean LOVE wallerstein for his weirdness, but over all my favorite guy for non longsword is Achille Marozzo. serioously he goes into such fine detail that Im in love with his work.,other than that Im strictly liechtenhauer,Sword and Spear,That's dogmatic HEMA bullshit. There are plenty of examples of edge-to-edge blocking, that's mostly what the unsharpened strong of the blade was for.,I'm not saying flat-to-flat contact is NEVER used, mind you. Both were employed.,I specifically mean, as 318 pointed out, Full strikes, with sharpened swords.,dogmatic maybe I wouldnt say all of HEMA is with him on that point. Im in HEMA, edge on edge is fairly common when I wind and I dont see how you can do it on the flat only, mostly I would say thats dogmatic ARMA bullshit. different animals really.,yeah static blocks are a no no,not to say this isn't cool, but are there any examples of 1 on 1 competitive combat that are more dramatic than just the exchange of single blows?,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjT4,yes if your looking for sport blossfechten, I cant remember the term for it though, honestly wallerstein has some pretty amazing throws and and inds that look AWESOME,Just found out there's a group for this in my area.,How expensive is it to get into?,Other than equipment its not really expensive at all. But it is habit forming and you tend to learn some German or Italian,what'S your favorite hema weapon?,mine are the longsword and the dagger (who wouldn't like some close and dirty stabbing and slashing),Nah that's bullshit. It really doesn't matter what part of the strong you block with, a sword could always be replaced after a battle.,Favorite is longsword followed by polearm then dagger I do not like sword and buckler,I'm a Messer man, myself. Followed by short staff and longsword.,Longsword is mai waifu.,So are you guys into the Italian or German schools?,I've been doing German, but my fencing group is Italian so I'm combining what I like from both into a bastard system.,Holy shit thank you! Finally someone who knows to utilize this stuff properly. I see too many swordsman reverting to MMA-like fighting, and it's very sad.,Anyone know of alternatives to German and Italian? I mean I love both, but I'd like to see more. I know one group does English Longsword, but I'd really like to see Medieval Scottish swordplay (Claymore, not broadsword), maybe even Spanish.,How about you just fuck off the Internet you statist libtard?,claymore ARE broadswords,I like german,someone wants EMA to by the snowflake....,you talk like a faggot, and your shit's all gay,I want to try this stuff, and I'm a fencer so should I start with rapiers?,swords are for plebs, most medieval fighting experts(at the time) agreed the quarterstaff was far and away the best dueling weapon available to someone who spent the time learning how to properly use it,there were no rapiers, get a longsword.,Are there any Ye Olde Sword Stabbing manuals for greatswords? Or zweihanders or whatever you're supposed to call them. ,I'd like to believe this weapon isn't relegated to my Japanese animes, and surely if someone used them, someone had technique for how to use them best.,go to macdonalds,wouldn't that beg the question of why so many extant manuals deal with swords then?,Bump for swards,http://www.middleages.hu/english/ma,Thanks dude. Have some flamberges.,Currently doing Kendo, as my city doesn't offer European Martial Arts anywhere and I live in a unit, so I can't practice it on my own.,EMA looks fucking awesome.,Have you tried talking to other people in your Kendo classes about it? If you can get a group together, you could try finding someone else's place to host at and practice there once a week or so. That's what I've been doing, personally. Not to mention, it's easier to study when you have at least two people to figure out what the hell's supposed to be happening.,I've only had a few classes so far and I'm not exactly comfortable with the people. Being from 4chan I don't have the best AFK interaction skills.,I'll remember this and ask a few if I manage to make some friends.,become,unstoppable,Unless I'm mistaken, is it not the case that the claymore are longer longswords (effectively), whereas the broadswords are (possibly basket-hilted) single handed swords used in combination with a spiked shield.,It's confusing because Enlightenment-era historians used ""claymore"" to mean both kinds of sword interchangeably, because they were fucktards, and also in the modern vernacular people use ""broadsword"" to mean any European sword.,In reality, a Claymore is a Scottish longsword. It was the same size as any other longsword, the main difference was the the crossguard was angled up towards the blade. A broadsword, contemporaniously called a ""clayberg"" is a basket-hilted one handed sword, essentially a battlefield version of a rapier, which is the style of sword it's ""broad"" in comparison to.,Shiggy diggy,If my kit wasn't packed for an educational demo today, I would have a boner in my codpiece that this board even exists. ,/tg/ and /k/ have been good to me though.,Have me (in the green) being stabbed in the face in celebration!,Keeping the guard aligned to minimize the risk of loosing a hand in the process is probably seen as the greater priority.,Pic not directly related, but somewhat.,I love how the guy who just had his hand chopped off looks, at worst, mildly annoyed at the situation.,Medieval art is funny sometimes.,Would a rapier be a legit self defense weapoin?,Probably. Smallsword or cutlass might be better, because they're more suited to enclosed spaces where you'd most likely be in a self-defense situation.,If I was going to carry a sword as an EDC, I'd probably go with a German longsword, however. Simply for the fact that it looks more intimidating, and is still going to be useful. The only people who are going to fuck with someone carrying a longsword are people with guns, and if the other guy has a gun and you don't you're screwed anyway.,What about hand to unarmed combat? does it exist on WMA? Cause I've never seen it.,You can, but the better question is, why would you want to? Unarmed systems are a dime a dozen. Go to your local community center and take a self-defense class. We do HEMA and SCA because pic related.,There's a decent bit of wrestling to be found in some old manuals, and they had at least two weight classes worth of people for it last Swordfish.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThUx,Interesting... So this wrstling was not designed for athletics? It actually has combat aplication?,As far as I can tell it's the foundation of a lot of both dagger and anti-armour work, and it can be quite useful is a straight up longsword match too, get in close and while your opponent wonders how to extract his sword form the bind to do some damage you throw him to the ground instead. It's not a good thing to lie flat on your back wondering what just happened when there's a hostile guy with a sword standing next to you...,And the applications if you ever end up in a fight unarmed, well, that gives itself.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6Pn,In the Lichtenauer tradition, dagger techniques are an extension of ringen, which is German wrestling. For more, check out the manuals of Talhoffer.,The problem is that much of the Eastern Martial arts have become stylized, whereas ringen was performed historically to kill people, and we still have a lot of those manuals.,Very interesting.,I will keep lurking these threads from now on.,I need to add,-- furthermore, there are techniques in longsword where you pass through someones guard and throw them to the ground, in cases like this, swordplay and dagger work can be inneffective. As the Samurai had Jiu Jitsu, so the German swordsmen had ringen,I-is fencing allowed here?,Other than boxing it is the one western martial art that is still a major sport.,Er, not counting wrestilng. Oops.,Still..fencing is cool right?,POSE the question. LEAVE the question. INVITE the question. Not beg, for flying cunt's sake. Begging the question is a completely different thing yes I mad.,Dosn't fencing already has its own thread? Plus modern fencing is purely athletic and is really different from WMA's swordfighting.,In my opinion, fencing isn't so much a martial as a sport because it has become so stylized. It doesn't really teach a defense usable anywhere outside of the controlled environment that it is. Whereas western dagger techniques against longsword techniques can be used to defend against a pool cue with a torch (for example) in a bar fight. In cases like this (from what I have observed), fencing would not teach you to defend yourself. ,However I am a longswordsman, so my opinion of fencing is quite biased.,I have no idea. I was just going by the thread OP. Fencing is a western martial art. It's true that competition fencing is no longer about winning first blood, but the rules of fencing are still designed to make you a superior swordsman (and the amount of pressure needed to be applied to score a touch was calculated as the amount of force needed to pierce the skin and so draw blood). Modern fencing is the direct, uninterrupted continuation of the discipline.,There is also historical fencing who history fags who like to take it back to how the sport was practised in prior centuries. Really, the only reason fencing is different from any other weaponed martial art is its popularity due to duelling.,Not true. The extra laws are there to teach you how to defend as a better swordsman. Obviously modern fencing doesn't teach you how to defend against different weapons, but that is hardly the point - its purpose is for duels, where the two opponents will be using the same weapon. Just as judo, wrestling and other martial arts have their rules in competition, so does fencing. ,A fencing is still going to fuck you up. I'd put money on an Olympic fencer verses any other weapon user, as long as they aren't heavily armoured.,Also, historical fencing is very popular, if not as popular as the modern form.,Give an Olympic épéeist a 19th century weapon and set him against any fag with a longsword or a dagger and see what happens.,I did not know that. Given that it is actually a defense, then I have no problem with fencing being in this thread. but as , says, there are already a few fencing threads.,I don't think I agree that a pro fencer would fare better (again, I have longsword bias) than a longsword, especially not a spearman. This is because once one has passed the point of a rapier, it no longer poses such a threat, where the longsword does.,However, having just youtubed Rapier vs Longsword, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7V,do you guys have any information on middle eastern fighting styles? Like with scimitars?,I watched that video too, it was pretty entertaining. How good would you say the guy with the longsword was? The one with the rapier I thought was fairly sloppy, but having no real knowledge of longsword forms I found the other guy very impressive. I take back some of my grandstanding.,In a real fight, the rapier user would try to tire his opponent out, keep distance, and make light thrusts to the arm, or any part of the body exposed, not wanting to go anywhere near that huge fucking sword being swung around. Seeing that the longswordsman's arms would likely be protected, it might be a long, long fight, with the rapier wielder eventually having to risk all on a thrust to his opponents face, ala that youtube clip.,I agree, I wouldn't call the longswordsman amazing, he does a lot of bad things.,I think I can see , from what you've just said, the difference between a rapier, or sword designed simply to stab, compared to a longsword. A would not deal a death blow immediately, whereas with a single strike of the longsword, death would be near instant.,From my (very limited) knowledge, this is why knights carry longswords. A raiper may be good for one to one combat (ie. dueling) where you have time to wear someone down, but the longsword would be better in a big battlefield where you don't.,Having said that, I'd prefer a longsword,Right. In a duel the main target is the opponent's sword arm, in particular their forearm, wrist and hand (because they are the nearest parts of the body). The idea is to draw first blood. The benefits of the rapier/short sword as a real combat weapon is chiefly its weight, in a period were firearms had made armour an anachronism. A rapier is all you need to kill someone dressed in the uniform of a musketeer.,I'm sure plenty of historical battles between longswordsmen and shortswordsmen must have taken place though. I'd be fascinated to learn more about it.,*smallshortmen. Herp derp. I wish I knew what the term for a rapier users was. Someone french here help an anon out.,The Lichtenhauer wards -- see where the arms are?,The philosophy behind this sword play tradition is to have an obvious opening (the entire left side in pflug and ochs, again the side in the Vom Tag pictured or the head in alber) so that you know where the sword is coming. Similarly, one spot is well defended. And In each of those cases the hands are close to the body -- they realised that the arms are a great target in the 14 and 15th centuries. If the hands do creep away from our bodies too far, then there is an opening on each side, leaving us effectively undefended. As you've said, if our arms are outstretched, the Lichtenauer tradition says to aim there.,Here ya go.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0fV,dat ass,Longsword or sabre, it would be unfair to choose since I suck at sabre.,I also do a little sword and buckler but I'm horrid at it.,I think I'd get kicked out.,I look like a south american riot police in full gear.,Sweet, a HEMA thread!,I have a question, I managed to finally kill my gambeson last week so I'm in need of a new jacket, when I finally decided on an Axel Petterson Jacket I realised that there were two versions.,WHICH ONE DO I GET?! I can't find any reviews on the PRO, except from AP himself saying that the shoulder and upper-arm plates are shit, but is the leather reinforcement worth another 100 monopoly monies?,I usually practice longsword and sword and buckler, and sometimes rapier and/or saber on the side.,A civil martial arts discussion? /asp/ rocks,Any weapon arts thread on any other board always devolves into hurr katana vs broadsword arguments between sperglords,Anyway, (ex-)iaijutsu practitioner here, just popped by to say keep it real swordbros.,What are western polearm systems like? I love love love love love the naginata, it's a gorgeous weapon to use once you get the feel of it, and I'm really curious to see how something like a halberd is used.,By infantry.,I found the sparring in every club I tried extremely lacking realism in comparison with fencing/kendo.,Granted, it's somewhat understandable because the weapons are more ""real"", but it still sucked.,look up achille marozzo his polearm system is amazing and extremey specific in how he wants you to do things. partisan in particular I find awesome.,It was a cool vid, but I just can't get over the opening speech.,I swear, it's like watching Pingu.,I think we should probably be careful with lumping rapier and modern sport fencing together, as the foil and epee pars of the latter would be a ""sporterized"" version of smallsword play, not the older rapier schools.,again very interesting, thank you.,Should probably remind the thread that smallsword is what modern foil fencing came out of; rapier fencing, on the other hand, was considered the domain of street hooligans, not upstanding gentlemen who had the authority to declare things 'sports'.,For example, if it was descended from street rapier, you'd probably see a lot more false-dagger work in modern fencing as well, whereas smallsword users abolished daggers because they increased the lethality of duels greatly compared to simply sword-on-sword.,That is my mistake, sorry for lumping the two together. I have not seen as much smallsword work as I have rapier, so I'd only seen the similarities between rapier and fencing.,I assume that at least one of my three points remain.,- longsword is a quick and effective way to deal with people. Where someone can live for a while after being stabbed with a point so small (unless they get a few very specific points), the longsword kills much faster because it slices through more flesh.,- in a similar vein, because the longsword is a quicker killer, it is better in a battle scenario rather than a duel scenario,- the smallsword doesn't pose a great threat once you've past the point,I'm just going off what I've observed, I have fenced a little (I'm a long way off being a master) but I longsword a lot,I think the problem with modern Olympic fencing is that you are trained to only fight in a straight line back and forth. Real fights don't work that way, you can move 360 degrees. Also there's the fact that someone with a longsword could just knock an epee out of his hands or at least out of the way pretty easily just by striking his sword.,If the opponent is lightly armored enough at the point of contact, a Rapier can very easily cut the person with a thrust or draw cut. So against a foe with lots of heavy armor, getting within reach is generally a bad idea; but if the foe has a lightly armored area, the Rapier can easily take advantage of it.,This may prove your point, but when fighting someone fully armoured, there are different techniques.,If I'm reading you correctly, what you're saying is that rapier techniques don't change when the foe is armoured?,Different guy here, but it's not like it's completely out of its depth there. One of the primary methods of countering armor is puncturing, either through weak points like the joints or by straight-up brute force through a plate, and a rapier's pretty good at puncturing. You're just not going to get a drawcut on a dude in plate, obviously.,The reason fights are ""straight"" is because that is the most efficient way to both attack and defend with a point weapon, when you move laterally to your opponent, you merely leave yourself a huge door that screams HIT ME.,Fencing is the only unbroken combat sport dating back to the age of sword, every technique we use evolved because it was effective at killing men. Fencing did not come from battlefield combat, it came from dueling, why everyone insists on putting a dueling art into a LOL INNA WARZONE context is beyond me.,The reason people developed Rapiers was because broadswords/longswords were heavy and cumbersome and warfare had evolved past them. The reason why the smallsword was developed is because the rapier was extremely long and uncomfortable to wear, so the gentlemans weapon became the smallsword. When they wanted to practice, they would ""foil"" their weapons making them non-lethal, hence the name ""foil"". ,Fencing evolved straight from dueling, in an uninterrupted line, and was still very much an active dueling art until WWII. ,Fencing is not about swinging a sword in a charge, or running across a battlefield, it is about defending yourself in a one-on-one duel against similar weaponry, because there was no SCA or HEMA when the smallsword was the dominate everyday weapon, no one was rocking a 300 year old weapon design just to be cool.,In closing, Fencing is what it is, stop trying to put it into some sort of medieval fetishist warfare ideal that it was absolutely never part of.,With a longsword against an armoured foe, a technique prescribed by Talhoffer is to hold the blade and used the pommel as a hammer against the helmet. There's a good doco on Talhoffer called ""Medieval Fight Book"", well worth the watch.,Oh great, in the same way that the other boards are ""Well my katana is better than your longsword faggot"", this board is going to be fencing vs longsword, where everyone is wrong because they didn't use caps lock.,But sword play in the real world isn't a straight line battle. The longsword isn't simply a pointed weapon, it's an edged weapon too. Circling is a great way to play with the measure, you can circle just out of someones reach without them realising, it's great. And the point made earlier, the smallsword doesn't pose a great threat once you've past the point, still remains. I'd happily get stabbed in an arm (for example) if it put the opponent within range of my descending blade for a long enough time.,That's one of the points of Lichtenauer, he says leave a huge door that says hit me so that you know where the sword is coming. ,Because this thread is about western martial arts, you're saying that fencing is better for dueling than a longsword, I'm saying longsword is better in a war zone and for dueling.,They're under 1.5kg (3.3lb), not that heavy at all. Personally, I would carry a sword in a stick, they're pretty pimp and convenient, I agree. But I'd prefer a weapon that cuts and stabs over a weapon that simply stabs,I don't have the time to look for a bunch of historical longsword weights at the moment, but assuming Albions and Arms and Armor have some clue...,Albion Regent: 1590g,Albion Munich: 1440g,Albion Fiore: 1500g,A&A Dürer: 1400g,A&A English Longsword: 1180g,For comparison, I've plotted the weight of the Wallace Collection rapiers in the attached pic. IMO it doesn't seem like they were all too desperate to loose weight. As for broadswords, unless we want to drain that word of almost all meaning, it means a double edged Scottish baskethilt, ie a sword considerably younger than the rapier.,Instead I would guess that the rapier came about because people wanted a single handed sword with good protection for the hand, going from balanced cut-n-thrust to somewhat heavily thrust-optimised to fit in with the fashionable forms of fencing at the time.,As for modern day sport fencing, do keep in mind that the rules does push the practitioners towards bad habits in some places. I wonder if disarming an epee practitioner is really as simple as , suggests though.,The rapier ""manuals"" we have surviving today (generally?) assumes that both combatants are without any armour to speak of. What techniques there may have been for when two cuirassiers ran into each other doesn't appear to have been preserved.,You're a fencer.

Who the fuck cares which would beat which, they never evolved styles to combat eachother at any rate.,Each weapon has a very specific purpose and methodology, arguing which is ""better"" is at best arbitrary and at worst painfully neckbeardish.,That thing is absolutely retarded.,Bump for more sword talk,Swords are pretty expensive, that is good swords are. As in, the swords that people try and make reproductions of. From experiance there is no real need to parry with the edge, sometimes its even faster not too as you dont need to twist your wrist as far to bring the dge to bear again.,In the Norman period a good sword is not somehting you would be replacing after every battle. indeed in later periods you have good quality sword blades being used for many years, even having their crossguards and pommels needing to be replaced to remain fashionable, if you cant afford to forge a new blade.,So your saying that an Olympic level athlete would be better at the sport he is awesome at than 'any fag'? wow good point there.,I've fought against a guys who has representing Great Britain at fencing, he had a rapier and I was suing a Norman sword. It was without a doubt one of the most challenging sparring sessions i've had. h/e ha the range and the speed advantage, (as well as skill). The only advantage you have is the strength of your blade, so you can make big parries and hopefully charge in and grapple him. ,The trouble is he could recover so fast from those parries that it is very difficult, and closing the distance is tough if your opponent can back step quickly. ,It's almost like rapier is several hundred years more advanced than my Norman gear...,A norman sword would have been used with a shield though so that should be doing 90% or more of your blocking/parrying. ,Were you using only a sword or sword and shield? If you were using only sword I can see why it'd be a much more challenging fight. With a shield I think you would have had an easier time.,One possible issue here is if one person is looking at things from an 11th century perspective , and the other one goes with the 16th century perspective. Not everything will change of course, biomechanics for example, but things like the cost of swords can change dramatically.,Anyway, regarding parries, you will be stronger if you use the edge, so if your opponent is putting a bit of spirit into his blows, then blocking those will pretty much require you using the edge. So unless you have a safe direction for the opponents sword to slide off to, and stand in a position to make that happen (ie you don't actually need to block) then you're probably going to get at least your own edge involved.,Also, apart from the risk of notching, the sword itself is actually stronger in the edge-to-edge direction too.,Other signs that a position like Clement's black-and-white ""never block with the edge"" may be going rather too far are things like the zornhau, blocking oberhau with ox, and blocking unterhau with pflug. As far as I can tell the validity of these techniques aren't exactly widely questioned, and all end up edge against edge if you want some strength in the block (and for zornhau, if both know what they're doing and try to get the centre). And you don't have to worry about getting your edge in lie again after any of them either, the first one actually being both block and cut to the opponents head at once, and the rest transitioning naturally into a thrust (possibly simultaneous).,If we dare go to Silver via Stephen hand, then that would be another case where we see a lot of edge parries.,Hell, we even find hard edge-to-edge contact in Japanese swordsmanship: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyYa,This. There's also the fact that even if you do get notches in your sword you can just grind them out later instead of having a whole new sword made. And in the 8-11th centuries when swords would have been extremely expense you have a shield to block with mostly eliminating the problem anyway.,I wish I could have an unarmed martial art thread this civil.,Polite sage.,I agree, and by the sounds of things, so do the guys in the video,heres a nice vid from this years swordfish, love the move at 07:30,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfoj,On blocking, you also can catch a blade, like in Krone guard, letting you deflect the blade at an angle and then catch it with the crossguard. Works well for heavy blows and when the other guy is strong at the blade.,I know,look at this for a fun but tricky technique,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZY2,Thats not what I tried to say, albeit the Rose is a nice techique. It is just if you fighting some of them Poles or Swedes, you better make damn sure to stop that blade before it reaches your hand.,Speaking of which, I really hope my gambeson (Gdansk Pro) turns up soon, since me and the rest of the nublets in the club has reached the first kinda free sparring now.

I upgraded to this in the meanwhile.,You got a pommel strike to your knee or what?,How useful is a longsword against a fully armored opponent? Would you be fucked if he had a pollaxe?,Dude, this is HEMA/WMA, we do read old fencing/fighting manuals and train according to it, but pollaxes and full plate are usually not our business. We wear sports equipment and train swordsmanship as a combart sport. ,That said, swords are not that great against plate armour. Never actually thought I'm gonna say this, but you better ask either the fa/tg/uys or the /k/atamites,Half-swording techniques are for use against an armored opponent. See: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S_Q,Wittenwiler has some sword/swiss dagger against halberd techniques. His main advise is run like hell.,thats what I use, lacross gloves are all thats really available atm, I tried the AF gloves and they suck ass.,Maybe not YOUR business, but plenty of HEMA guys read Talhoffer and Mair's manuals on polearms and recreate the techniques in a sparring environment. ,Case in point, these guys: http://youtu.be/7Ijy8Ky_vrI?t=3m15s,What's wrong with AF's gloves?,they tear apart extremely easily, the finger profile is TOO long and you cant effectively grip the blade. in my group we had three people try them out with each our own sets, one pair ripped in half immediately upon using them, the second pair withstood a few matches but then the fingers tore out of the right hand first and middle finger pocket.,also the sizes are not good, they currently dont have enough sizes out to be wearable by most people just too big or too small.,dont get me wrong Im love AF for all the work they are putting into the hema community but the gloves really do suck ass.,Somewhat, though the lack of protection was a bit of a damp blanket as I had to worry about my opponent quite a bit more than I'd like.,Don't worry, I'm well versed in the basics of kendo: wipe up your own blood.,I got a good slap on the knee with a bokken once during my iaido days, in kata-like practice. I guess I should try to remember bringing them to practice next time.,I think I saw a pair of AF gloves worn by one guy at my club a while back. He's currently looking for something to wear while waiting on his Ensifer gloves to turn up. Any conclusions drawn form this will of course be somewhat speculative, but still.,Me, I'm waiting for my gambesson so I can measure myself properly for a pair of Ensifers. Give some time to wallow in indecision about three finger vs mitten. A pair of bandy gloves with home made thumb reinforcement (with my old kendo kote standing by if need be ) will have to do until then.,Another guy in my club has made his own by taking some unknown glove, and covering them in rubber cut from bicycle tires (such being a plentiful, natural resource in Uppsala) attached with duct tape.,Another good thing to remember is to point out when I've stopped talking about my knee(s), and started talking about my knee pads.,3 guys from GAGSchola and some Hammaborgers do, the rest, I wouldn't know of anybody else who can be taken for full...,If you like, I can show you a 5 week old CRT of my skull, and explain you why one should not do semi contact dagger sparring without a mask...,So, which European HEMA events should I get pumped for next? Celje and SwordFish seem a long way off, and they're the kind of events that I enjoy. Athletic, teaching focused ones preferably.,Kind of tired of having my time wasted by people who don't grapple/morbidly obese participants/soft introductions with an incredibly low barrier to entry.,Rybnik SKUNKS Event, NordCamp, Ars Ensis Summer Camp, FightCamp, W3 Warzaw, SMDF.,Also, where you from then?,Ha, weird to see that turn up here.,As an aside, I got some really nice sparring in this weekend. My opponents had good kit, were reasonably confident and fully understood what they were getting themselves in for. I didn't have to worry about my kit or coaching them or worrying about improving their game. First chance I've had to try HEMA again since my new job.,mfw,Didn't even play a complicated game.

Any idea of the details on Ars Ensis/W3/SMDF yet?,Think I'll give FC a miss this year. It's a lot of money and effort for few good classes. That might change if they fly Gregor Medvesek over like some of the bloody Dutch did last weekend.,The hilt fittings do look similar. I think I saw some in some stained glass recently...,Are you suggesting my class won't be worth putting up with the rest of FC?,Yes.,Rybnik is end of May, and I believe it costs around €30 for 3 days. Expect around 50-60 people competing overall and maybe 100 people there.,Likely the guys from Ringschule Wroclaw will be there and give a class and maybe organize a tournament. ,NordCamp is end June / start July, and thats one week with Fechtschule Gdansk. Jan & Lukasz will drill you longsword and youz can has sparring all day long , Marcin Surdel does langes Messer. €100 for the full week.,Both events are polish FEDER rules.,Ars Ensis Summer Camp is last week ofJuly, somewhere in Hungary.

The FEDER site doesn't seem to have any.,For the others a whole week is a long time to take out of work/girlfriend/life.,Nope, no details yet, only got a text message from the guy who organized last year.,Hotel room was €15 a night.

And €15 is nothing really.,If you find out more, mind passing it my way?,In the mean time, have a fucked up tangle from a 1470s-1480s South Netherlands tapestry.,One observation/thought which struck me a while back, and which popped back now, is that over in kendo/iaido, in the guard corresponding to the pflug, you mostly just have the sword in front of you when you're using a daito (katana/tachi or equivalent), but you stretch out forward when using a shoto (wakizashi or so) so te tip ends up at a similar distance from your body.,And now with a longsword, I draw my hands back to my body, and the tip still stays at roughly the same spot.,Looks like that kind of hilt, yes, though with blades of that size you could probably get away with calling them swords...,I think that's reasonably similar with the longsword and the messer: in the messer wards it isn't as bad to have your hands further away from your body.,Bumphau,Any recommendations for sidesword texts in English?,IIRC, Paulus Hector Mair's ""Rappier"" work is considered to actually be about sidesword-work rather than what we currently think of as a rapier.,http://freifechter.com/PHM_Rappier.,Whats up. I'm looking for a western martial arts club in the area of Leiden, netherlands. Can anyone give me any recommendations?,whose redneck now wrastlin tards,Have you tried the HEMA Alliance group finder yet?,http://www.communitywalk.com/map/in,/r/ some more like this, please?,I'm not even that particular about what or who or when from, I just want things to toy around with, since I'm an extreme rookie and haven't picked a weapon of choice yet (Mostly because I can't afford a real sword.) Saw some bolognese stuff on Youtube that looked pretty interesting. Does anyone have references for that, maybe?,As an aside, is there any functional use for a disproportionate degree of strength? I know that swords are more of a speed and technique game, but I noticed that in a lot of occidental legend and fiction that there's usually someone using a disproportionately large weapon. Is there a purpose to doing that in the first place aside from the surprise factor?,I admit, I kind of find the idea of using the moves of a light sword with a much heavier weapon amusing in the best way... and it could help a bit since I'm a bit of a manlet with no reach.,In the Lichtenhauer tradition we're told to always cut at the person, so our defense is our offense and vice versa. Edges are constantly clashing but the metal is strong enough to hold it's edge. For example, here's a katana getting shot. It holds its edge nicely. A longsword holds it's edge when it clashes, too.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdFm,My gut feeling is that the huge weapons would have been something to spice up the story mostly, or to look impressive in the case of parade weapons.,That said, being able to send your opponent flying with a shrug would certainly be handy if you get in close. Trying to use techniques intended for, say, smallsword with a four pound sword on the other hand would probably just lead to frustration, and possibly various wrist injuries...,Well... I dunno. I've done a lot of wrist ""training""...,Jokes aside though, even if it wouldn't be super effective, it might be interesting to try a bit. I believe strongly in skill synergy and technique adaption. Even if it doesn't work the same, that's not a reason you can't learn something from it... so study everything, y'know?,I still have no idea what I'm going to do for practice, though, since it seems like being able to find readable manuscripts is a skill everyone posesses except me. Maybe I'm just a pleb for not being very history-inclined?,You're just a tad bit more pathetic than a person who can spell ""weeaboo"". Even the katana guys aren't all bad, btw, so long as they aren't the sort who think katanas can cut through tanks and respect the practice of other sword arts. Most of the bad ones are armchair warriors without any real formal training anyway.,1/10 for making me respond.,Has a few more, specifically from Paulus Hector Mair, Jacob Sutor, and Joachim Meyer.,And as I put up earlier in the thread, look around with:,Since you're, as you say, a 'manlet', you might want to check out some of Mair's shortstaff and halberd-work.

You gonna like Lopes.,Probably the best Western martial arts is sambo. It has some roots to judo but it also draws heavily from the wrestling and combat styles within the former Russian Empire.,son, are you drunk?,Well I guess it is technically a western martial art, just not historical like everything else in this thread...,On the other hand, new event in Amsterdam in September - details are on FB, but 4chan won't let me post a link...,Pomegranate for fertility, apples for sin, grapes for hedonism..., handetrucken,Do you have any illustration of it? I'm still struggling a bit with the lingo, and google has been about as much help as Wikenauer so far: http://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Hande_Tr,Brick killed a guy!,Note to self: Study physics and invent a type of fancy-ass sword that actually can cut through tanks.,Too late.,I tried to avoid the lingo at the time. There are a couple of examples of hand-pressing in the Liechtenauer tradition of MSs.,Let's say you're in the bind, you're putting a lot of pressure in. Your opponent lets your blade slide off and raises his into a hanging Ochs or a high vom Tag.,You interrupt his movement and place your blade on his forearms and wrists, making pushing against it very unpleasant for him.,From the Dresden of Ringeck's Gloss:,54] How the slice counters the Crown.,Slice through the Crown,,so you break this guard quickly.,Press with the sword,,with more slicing you draw backwards.,Glosa When he defends against the Scheitelhau or some other cut with the Crown and tries to rush in against you, pull the slice under his hands in his arm and press hard upwards, to break the Crown. And turn your sword from the under slice to the over slice, and thus draw back.,I just got confirmation, SKUNKS will be 24th-26th May, Info will be availavle next week. I'll keep you posted.,Nope, but I did drill Meyers interpretation. If somebody comes into close mensur by useing ""Buffelhaw"" (just wild swings), use an undercut aginst his hands when they are high up, push away his hands with your shildt/strong. ,So your putting pressure on somebodys wrists who came to close and then strike for the opening. Also saw this in an older Fechtbuch, but cannot remember which one. You can also do it from above, for example against a Twerhau combo.,Ok, I think I'm starting to figure out how it's supposed to work. Not bad, as I need to both sleep and sober up at the moment.,Something silly while I see to that, for those who missed it before when it was posted on /k/: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up9K,bumpenhauer. see you guys tomorrow.,I believe - and note, believe - that what we know as zweihanders and the like may not have had a personal combat or martial art role, but rather a tactical role. Mika Waltari's The Adventurer, a generally fairly well-researched novel despite being fictional, notes that doppelsoldners were generally made of particularily retard-strong indviduals and situated in pushes of pikes, with the task to chop the opposing push's pikes apart primarily over the soldiers, and once a push of pikes had entangled into one of those famous ""oh god what the hell is happening and whose hand is that in my pantaloons right now"" - level tangles, a doppelsoldner would also seek to ""disengage"" the lot by cutting the entangled pike mess and generally shoving and pushing and throwing dudes to and fro to create enough of an opening for close combat, as well as to perpetuate the actual ""push"" that was necessary to make the opposing push to lose forward momentum and turn to rout.,... are you a Dane?,One suggested problem with the ""pike cutting"" theory is that ash is quite tough, but not all that stiff, and with fifteen or so feet of it a small amount of force towards the tip will bend it quite a lot, and also present a lo of true at the grip, pushing it aside even further. So unless the cut hits just so, the pies may simply be pushed aside.,On the other hand, such might actually be entirely sufficient tactically speaking.,A bit further north.,I'd imagine the displacement idea might be sufficient as well. The image I have of combat between pike pushes is that to me, it seems that the ""pushing"" itself was more decisive than the pikes themselves, and that the combat was resolved by which side started yielding ground and losing forward momentum first.,Also, the only other country I've seen those comics in is Finland, so that would be my next guess, even if Sweden would be more probable by subject.,Well put faggot.,My SCA group does full contact sparring; Shield to the face is a life experience I tell you what.,Well, momentum appears to be of extreme importance for nearly all (sufficient size) group melee, so that seems like a reasonably safe assumption.,And the country is Sweden.,My group does full contact sparring. The first time someone thrusts, or performs a hip throw on you, is something you never forget.,SCA is some overweight to obese goons dressing up in renaissance gear and hitting each other with foam padded weapons.

That was my inspiration for years, I trained hard as never before in my whole life just to get on that level and fight those guys. ,Guess Axel will not even remember that figth, but for me it was one of those ""Fuck yeah, you really did it!"" moments, and thats why the pic hangs in my hallway.,Bumpenhau,SKUNKS tournament registration is out: http://www.vectir.pl/skunks,I'm 6'10"", and have some knowledge of swordplay.

Also Claymore is just a name, not something very specific,Swordplay. As in sword fighting.,Also, I should not have used the word Claymore. I was referring to swords of similar size and use, such as zweihanders and greatswords.,Ok, so you have expirience in swordfighting? What expirience do you have, what school have you trained for how long?,Also, what do you need your sword for? Training, Cutting, Sparring, Wallhanging, what?,If you're looking to train some variant of HEMA, then you should probably start by taking stock of the groups you have around, because it's very much a social activity, and while it seems that groups like the SCA might go with whatever weapons-wise, actually HEMA groups may turn out to be a lot more narrow in their focus.,As for the claymore, if you mean the greatsword then I'm not aware of any manuscript dealing with it specifically, but they should fall well within the range of sizes shown in the German longsword manuals. For the baskethilt (aka highland broadsword/backsword and other such) on the other hand there should be some material around, Silver's ""Brief Instructions Upon My Paradoxes of Defense"" being one, Zach Wylde another I think, etc.,anybody been to the last Dreynevent in vienna? oppinions?,Clubmates regularly go and like it a lot.

"What's a good martial art to train at for someone that is skinny, wants to be able to defend himself, and also has a relatively large learning curve (something that you can keep getting better at for years)?,A gun.,Gah. Meant to post more. It's less about the style in particular and more about the training method and skill of your teacher. Make sure the students are fit, look around the class and see if they lift weights and condition themselves, see if they spar or regularly test themselves under live conditions, see if they are encouraged to be critical (within reason) and ask questions of the instructors. As long as those things are cleared up, your training is likely to be worth a damn,do aikido. shitload of time, you'll get ridiculosly good results. or daito-ryu,If you seriously need it for self defense, you should consider visiting , and getting some tips on bulking up (read the sticky before posting any threads, though), as being big works pretty well for deterring someone from starting a fight in the first place.,Of course it would still be a good idea to do some sort of martial art, but I can't really help you there.,If you need it because you'd like to get in a fight (and actually stand a chance), then you're just a faggot with a small man's complex.,oh lord. there we go.,What? Bulking is the best way to get big, fast. I'm not saying he has to go on a 1000 calorie surplus PERMABULK, but bulk/cutting is the best way to get big, if you don't care about looking unaesthetic while bulking.,Some martial arts revolve around grappling, some on hitting, kicking, chi channeling (lol) and even a few dance based martial arts. They are all rendered obsolete by a little known art that has no name. This art has been considered so lethal it was banned from UFC, MMA and all those other girly pretend fighting sports. It is often taught to soldiers and is widely used in warfare. Like I said, it has no name but the core philosophy of this fighting technique revolves heavily around shooting people in the face. With a gun.,For the record, I can't buy a gun where I live. Also, I want to practice it for more than just self-defense (but that is important).,Doesn't matter what style you train,Doesn't matter how many people you are fighting at once,Doesn't matter if you train for the streets, train for sports, or train.,Doesn't matter how big or expensive your gun or knife is.,Nothing beats a well placed pipebomb.,Why waste hundreds of dollars and hours of your time with the risk of hurting yourself while you practice when you could make a pipebomb over night for about 40 bucks. All you have to do is google free pipebomb recipes, go to your kitchen or bathroom sink. Maybe go to Lowes or Wal-Mart. And you can make a device that will instill more fear and harm more people then any style, weapon or workout routine.,The fight doesn't magically end. There are no time limits in the street. The fight ends when you want it to end. If someone confronts you, retreat, regroup, its a viable tactic. Follow your enemy find out their daily routine to work, to school, to the grocies. Exploit them when their guard is down. Just like how they were trying to exploit you. Now google free pipebomb recipes, assemble your pipebomb. And plant the pipebomb on the side of the road or at an intersection you know they will drive through. There's reason why people such as soldiers who are better armed, better equipped and better trained than any martial artist or fighter fears improvised explosive devices such as a pipebomb. All that training, all that knowledge is out the window when blind-sided by a pipebomb. Thinking a street fight is just a fight will get you killed. A street fight is a personal war on your well being. The first person to do the most horrible thing wins. If they try to out muscle you, you punch them, they try to punch you, you stab them, they take out a knife, you shoot them with your gun, they take out a gun you blow them up with a pipebomb.,Nothing beats one., is that way,Keep the pipebomb jokes there.,Don't be bringing that shit here.,Boxing or Jiu jitsu. Many boxers are skinny as hell, but pack a mean punch. Jiu jitsu doesn't require brute strength (but it will help).,jiu jitsu comes to mind.,Krav Maga if you're not above ripping the balls off someone and always fight dirty.,Brazilian jiujitsu is always a great option, especially for the smaller guys. You have to find a good school though, most of the Gracie academies are great because they teach self defense (the combatives) first and then go into the sport / tournament jiujitsu at the advanced belt classes (blue - black).,i would suggest bjj boxing muay thai or judo.,i've never seen any krava maga or aikido that didn't look totally choreographed and bullshit, tbh. with boxing /bjj / judo you'll get a chance to practice your skillset at full speed and pretty much full force on resisting opponents during sparring and tournaments. and speaking from experience, bjj and judo are lots of fun. you just have to get comfortable with pressing up against other people.,THIS,Sprinting you pussy,BJJ.,i bet thqt girl has sex with her dog,it's funny, posers and rookies will say ""omg BJJ is gay!"",Big fucking surprise everybody! if you want to hurt someone you are probably going to have to touch them.,fix'd that for you,try to learn some standup (boxing,kickboxing,karate,etc),and some grappling (bjj, judo, wrestling),this is the best thing you can do to learn to defend yourself without the use of weapons,If you are truely concerned about defending yourself then don't sell yourself short, get a weapon. If you just want to kick Danny the drunkard's ass outside the bar then muscle up and learn to box.,As if rubbing your dick all over another guy isn't gay,THAT'S MY PURSE, I DON'T KNOW YOU,The question becomes, ""would you willingly be a faggot in order to kick someone's ass?"",As expected of the Jews.,you can hurt someone plenty at arm's reach. you and your opponent don't need to find out how each other's balls feel and smell like in order to hurt one another.,what happens when your opponent knocks you down and starts wailing on you while youre on the ground,grab the collar of his shirt, pull him down towards you, and start making out,Aikido, if you're into philosophy n shit.,Karate, some strength may be required but if your training is traditional you will be toughened the fuck up so quickly.,Wing Chun,in b4 haet,OP in my opinion, boxing. You'll go from some skinny guy that will easily be snapped in half by some grappling martial art (no offence guys) to some skinny guy that uses that as an advantage. You'll be taught how to fight properly, how to move properly, and you'll be FAST. skinny guys can make very fast boxers, the longer you stick with it the better you'll get.,I'm skinny (60KG/132LB) and I do BJJ. Good fun, feel way more confident after you do some classes, would definitely recommend. Look up the Gracie Jiu Jitsu challenges if you want to see how it compares to other martial arts.,But I'd definitely recommend cross-training in boxing, muay thai, and judo as well if at all possible. Any of those martial arts would be good.,Is there anyone here in the US that studies traditional European fencing? ,All I've got is me and my friend. No, not that stupid shit with white suits and face guards. The real damn thing. ,I'm studying European manuals right now and me and my friend are the only people doing it. I'd like other people to share experience with. ,I'd also love to consult with Europeans who are trying to rediscover the techniques and moves movements of combat during the medieval (specifically) period. ,This is not a modern fencing thread. This is the only stupid image I could find. ,This is for people trying to rediscover the combat arts of Europeans. Fucking video games.,Martial arts (in the western world anyways) train you to be good on the mat, more often than not it does not do an adequate job in preparing you for an all out fight with an opponent out to hurt/cripple/kill you. Oh and if they pull a knife you fucking run, do whatever is humanly possible to stay out of knife fights. I'd almost prefer going up against a guy with a gun than a guy with a knife.,aemma.org,Jeet Kune Do,Oh, here we go with 'teh deadly'. So which mystical eastern arts train you for the realities of combat? Fucking none of them any moreso than 'western' ones. The split, like the traditional/sport one is non-existant. That said, whats more important than your style is the quality ofyour training. Focus on finding a gym that is compotent first, before thinking about anything else,Sure, theres currently two threads on this board, just ask away.,I would recommend boxing. Punching is pretty much the foundation of unarmed combat, and there's nothing better for it than boxing. You'll also be focusing on only one thing instead of learning a million things at once. I think once you've got a good grasp of boxing you could consider taking up Muay Thai, kickboxing or Kyokushin as well, if you want to learn kicks.,For grappling, either BJJ or Judo. They're both derived from Jiujitsu, but BJJ emphasizes ground grappling while Judo emphasizes grappling from a standing position. I think overall BJJ might be better.,No matter what martial art you're doing, you can always get better.",,"03/29/13(Fri)19:42,03/29/13(Fri)19:43,03/29/13(Fri)19:48,03/29/13(Fri)19:56,03/29/13(Fri)20:03,03/29/13(Fri)20:08,03/29/13(Fri)20:19,03/29/13(Fri)20:20,03/29/13(Fri)21:08,03/29/13(Fri)22:41,03/29/13(Fri)22:54,03/29/13(Fri)23:01,03/29/13(Fri)23:11,03/29/13(Fri)23:33,03/29/13(Fri)23:37,03/30/13(Sat)00:16,03/30/13(Sat)00:38,03/30/13(Sat)01:01,03/30/13(Sat)01:38,03/30/13(Sat)01:43,03/30/13(Sat)01:44,03/30/13(Sat)01:46,03/30/13(Sat)02:54,03/30/13(Sat)03:10,03/30/13(Sat)03:25,03/30/13(Sat)03:26,03/30/13(Sat)03:31,03/30/13(Sat)03:32,03/30/13(Sat)03:41,03/30/13(Sat)03:48,03/30/13(Sat)03:52,03/30/13(Sat)04:09,03/31/13(Sun)02:18,03/31/13(Sun)02:39,03/31/13(Sun)03:59,03/31/13(Sun)05:10,03/31/13(Sun)07:00,03/31/13(Sun)07:10,03/31/13(Sun)07:22,03/31/13(Sun)08:24,03/31/13(Sun)09:13,03/31/13(Sun)10:17,03/31/13(Sun)10:20,03/31/13(Sun)10:48","Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,KBApprentice , ,03/31/13(Sun)08:24 ,KBApprentice,!!i310bPx4QfO,Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"

"Drum Corps, Marching Band, Winter Guard, Indoor Drumline, whatever floats your boat. Let's talk about it, /asp/.,Who do you speculate are going to be the top corps for the 2013 DCI season?,Is anyone else excited for SoundSport? It sounds like it could be really cool.,Daily reminder that the Blue Devils suck.,I performed at that show. That was from 2006 when Phantom had their show in Memphis, Tn in June... I think it was there second show?,After the show I was talking to some members of their euphonium line and they kept commenting about how bad the humidity was there compared to all days in Illinois.,Back in the good ole days.,Btw, for those interested in marching any top 6 corps, go spend some time marching a lower corps before you think you'll make on of those corps. When I auditioned for Phantom in 2007, there were 84 auditionees for what was essential 6-8 spots (after returning vets) on the euphonium line. If you do not have previous corps experience, then your chances of making it are quite slim... especially if you try out on anything percussion related.,Remember, you are not above marching a lower corps or Open class corps. I marched corps in Division II (now open class), a lower Div I (now world class) and a corps that finished in the top 4. My best experiences and hardest summers were the my time in the ""lower"" corps.,Definitely. What matters is the experience, not the scoring, although placing well always makes things better.,Is 2013 going to be the year the Academy finally breaks top 12?,What is the audition process like?,Is marching technique considered a factor or is it all playing technique?,I was not expecting this.,To be honest I don't remember that much about it. You'll be judged on both marching and playing ability. They both count equally and I believe you are scored out of a 100 on both. You'll spend the weekend like a normal winter camp, lots of warm ups, ensemble, sectionals and things like that. During all this, auditionees will be pulled out from whatever the activity is, they give you time to warm up and you play the prepared piece and some sample exercises. Percussion is going to be fairly similar and I honestly have no idea what guard does during these camps lol.,Previous marching experience (either drum corps or a well established BOA band) will help you alot. Their are plenty of good players who audition but in reality, they don't need phenomenal players, they just need people who are good enough to play the music and do it on the move. Anything extra is just bonus.,Have a good attitude and even if you get cut, if you are dead set on marching that corps, ask to come back and still attend the later camps for the experience. They'll either keep you around, someone will eventually drop out, and you can get their spot or they'll help you find another corps.,I lol'd at that. Back when I was in marching band in high school, all the faggots who sent in a letter to join 'varsity marching band' just to get a faggy, customized, letterman jacket.,Amazing of all the scrawny and fatfucks who do marching band and consider a legitimate exercise, on par with organized sports.,Yes, it can tiring, especially depending on what instrument you play. But it's not a sport, requiring much legitimate athleticism.,Bandies are the worst.,I'm normally not ""that guy"", but really bro?,http://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=pDla,Those trips, haha.,But I wouldn't say they were the worst. Yeah, some I wanted to curb stomp for being such aspie faggots. Plenty of gawky nerds, but others that were total bros.,But some of what you see in American Pie is correct. There were some real nympho band bitches.,Marched I think around 1 mile straight every year in the Christmas parade.,Marched 3 miles straight when we went to London to play in the New Year's parade a couple years back,I didn't say,I said,So many of them couldn't run for 5 minutes straight, or even do 20 pushups in a set, if they were required. Marching isn't that hard. Roll step, pivot, march backwards on toes. Dress to file and rank.

All drums corps is I'd running (stretch & run, breathing block, your actual show). ,I fucking dare you to hold a Jupiter contra at carry for 2 minutes without breaking.

It does not put forth as much strenuous activity in a performance, as it does in rehearsal. ,And because people actually think they are /fit/ from working stabilizer muscles and cardio from marching..lol,Never heard of symphonic band.,I can't even compare the amount of tightass virgins I've seen in orchestras throughout, compared to marching band.,WGI is all sorts of fucked up this year. I don't know if anyone was at Southeastern champs, but the scores there were absurdly disproportionate.,No there isn't. Go do your homework, kid. Marching band isn't a sport.,Anybody on a winter guard this season?,FCO Forever,I doubt you've ever seen a marching band competition before. ,I've seen college and high school bands in person. ,Besides size, a lot more goes into college band field shows than high school field shows.,Are you kidding me?,And read an entire post before posting, you dumbfuck.,Basic technique is a must, but whatever you do where ever you come from is going to be different somehow from the corps you're auditioning for, so specifics aren't important. Just be consistent.,Unless you've been to all the camps already and they can reasonably expect you to know their style by the time you're auditioning.,Being able to play smoothly on the move is a must.,Junior in high school here, I'm in the Indoor/outdoor colorguard and I really want to march Corps just one year. I'm kind of in between Phantom Regiment and Carolina Crown. Should I try out for multiple corps, and if so, how many? If I can't get into phantom or crown, I'd probably march DCA (hawthorne Cabs) for a year and try again, or march Jersey Surf since they're close to where I live. Any suggestions?,trying out for RCC 2014 on bass guitar. cant be bothered to switch from woodwind to brass for DCI...,Go World Class DCI or go home. ,Don't be intimidated: you're up against a lot of other rookies too, so you have a good shot as long as you show heart and drive.,Don't forget 13-16th places either. They're still contenders and have a good shot at finals any given season.,As far as how many to try out for, just consider the cost to GET to camps and also scheduling. If I were you I'd definitely keep JS as a backup because it's close.,I plan on working my whole senior year in dedication to paying for corps. How lenient are they with payment plans? I guess it varies from group to group but I'm not super rich or anything. I just want to do it once for the experience and then march Blackwatch in WGI for the rest of my forever. ,I just wanna fucking spin.,Couldn't say. Ask when you go in.,I was lucky enough to have very supportive relatives, although I fronted a significant portion myself and don't regret it at all.,Did you fund raise at all?,I don't know much of Blackwatch's stuff, but This Bitter Earth is one of my favorite shows, go for it. ,I know that feel, I'm a senior in high school and this is my first/most likely last season spinning and I wish I could do it more.,underageb&,This entire thread is underage LOL,Both my instructors march/teach blackwatch so I was kind of ""born"" into it. This is my 7th season spinning, I'm pretty fond of the activity.,I'd been saving up on my own in general for quite some time. I'm generally really frugal, but I recognized my best chance at achieving my dream and took it.,I applied REALLY late (as in mid-April) so there wasn't TIME to fundraise much.,So yeah, if you're not already accepted for this season, it's actually not too late. And with an extra month over what I had, you could definitely raise some funds to help you along.,I'm an age-out.,I'm on Nease SW this year, our instructors used to run Northeast Independent, but they folded because of lack of rehearsal space.,I loved their 2010 show, especially the intense sabre in the beginning.,Ruthless Gravity? Yeah, Northeast is one of my favorite guards of all time. Jill and Robby are amazing designers, it's an honor to have them working for us. You should watch 2009, it's the show that made me give light, breathy shows a chance.,all my designers like to do is sad, angsty and yearning shows. We've done them for the past three years. It's gotten us places, but it's kind of getting old. ,personally, I like energetic/cool shows. I like to excite the crowd but to be technically impressive as well. I'm not sure if you know Light Brigade, their shows are crowd pleasing but they're technique and design is horrendous.,I just saw light brigade this weekend at southeastern champs. Their technique and design is indeed atrocious, but their story is a sadder one than that, I'm afraid. As it turns out, Light Brigade was started in an inner city in Pittsburgh to help troubled kids through the arts and at one point were extremely good and entertaining, but now the members have gotten too old to be demoted to IO and the program is slowly dying.,That is really unfortunate. a lot of groups are starting to be out of commission, but the problem is usually money. Kind of like the Glassmen.,Fuck yeah, I was in winter drumline for 3 years in high school, was fun as fuck. I played bass guitar so I didn't get to march but still had a great time.,Yeah, it's such a shame to see people unable to do what they really love just because of the money.,I'm interested, stranger; Where do you spin now? And what's your show?,I'm on weapons and flag, I spin with Plymouth Whitemarsh HS. Our show is called ""the words I never said."" It's okay, we have a lot of new people, and we have to teach them how to spin while we learn to show. it's a challenge but we've been working with it for years.,I haven't had much experience with WGI personally, but my family has made good ties with Interplay.,I wonder if they can teach an old eupher how to spin and not hurt people.,It's not so hard once you get the hang of it, but theres a lot to learn. I don't think you ever stop learning.,I understand, guard is hard to just pick up. We're in SW for the first time in school history and it's been difficult, but so, so rewarding. I'm on rifle and dance for most of the show, flag for the flag feature, you know how it is. I'm from Nease High school and the show title is ""Divenire"" because Jill has a way with making her show concepts really complicated to explain to people who ask.,Anyone can learn it, it's just the dedication that comes with really wanting to be able to achieve it that makes you good.,What rotations can you toss? and are your tosses on the buzzy or lofty side? I can toss up to a six on a full dip, and up to a 5 on a quarter dip.,I remember being an edgy 17 year old.,March a few years of drum corps and watch their shows again. You'll have a new appreciation.,In the guard colloquialism: You better get it, girl, serve it up.,The experienced marchers hate the Cavs instead.,after actually learning about the Dada movement I had some respect for their 2012 show.,It's awesome that so many people here march drum corps.,If you've never actually gone out: Just do it. If/when you get cut from your 'dream corps', and don't march top 6, don't just insult the rest of the activity and not march. March any open class corps, just do it. You'll never regret it,Experienced marchers don't hate anyone.,I think the more I watch the 2012 season on DVD (I missed most of the shows since I was marching), BD's show made more sense than Crowns. I'm glad they won, but it has to be said that scores don't matter.,Most of the Cadets I know from 2011 didn't even buy the ring. The experience is what matters.,Our technique is a full dip for triples and higher, so I can get a 7 out pretty consistently. The key to tossing consistently is to think of pushing and releasing the rifle as two different motions, the push is what gives it the rotation, the left hand gives it height. Try slapping yourself in the thigh with your right hand as you push and make sure your left arm doesn't move on the dip. Are you buzzy or lofty?,This is absolutely terrible advice.,I got 11th the only year I could do it.,I said the year before, watching Finals from the stands, ""I will be down there next year."",And then I did it. Dream achieved.,I probably almost died (not exaggerating) a couple times along the way, but it was worth it.,Their entire style is smoke and mirrors.,i'm totally out of my element here but,what the fuck am i reading,I got sent to the hospital once my rookie year (asthma attack combined with mild dehydration on some ungodly 98 degree + humidity in southern Virginia) but otherwise made it out. I've done 3 years but never made finals, I don't mind that much looking back.,I still have 2 years left, but I can't see me leaving my home corps. I'll always consider it, especially my age out, but I doubt I'll ever leave. It's too much of a family to me.,well the way I'm taught and am supposed to toss is lofty in my eyes, but I know how to toss both ways. I just try really hard to match up the heights with the people in my section. ,Also I think I'm going to copy and print out your rifle advice and put it somewhere so whenever I teach a new person, I can say exactly what you did because you're absolutely correct.,Essentially, technique for tossing rifle, I could explain further, if you'd like,I've marched with Surf before. I was hornline, but I can get you in touch with people if you have specific questions.,I know of two girls who have been in our colorguard before going to Crown, and a ton of Blackwatch/Surf alum go to Phantom. I can also really vouch for the family atmosphere at Surf.,I'm more than happy that I could help you out, I could make a technique checklist if you'd like,I'm just not a very good teacher, it's probably something I need to learn before I am teaching my own group. I seem to make youngn's frustrated even though I don't mean to.,The youngn's are prone to frustration and self-deprication when their first few attempts aren't exactly correct like their instructor, make sure to encourage them frequently and always be constructive when pointing out their mistakes, tell them what they're doing right as often as what they're doing wrong and let them know that this is hard stuff and it's going to take a long time to master. Make a mental list of points that need improvement and be as personal as possible.,Thanks so much for the advice, now methinks I will be a much better leader to the youngn's. I'm afraid it's time for me to catch some Z's, but I really enjoyed talking to you. ,also thank you for the info. I'm alot more confident in my corps choices hearing about other people and their successes.,I'm more than happy to help, I think everyone should have the opportunity to do what they love at the highest possible level. And if they as you where you got the advice, just say Brent, the Nease boy!,Bump.,I do enjoy marching band, But I just don't know where to find these complete DCI competitions,Guess who just became an /asp/ie,check DCI .org for tour schedules what corps will be at what shows.,bump for eternal /dci/,Sup /dci/. Just reminding you SCV kicks ass.,Should have gotten percussion caption last year imo,are you kidding me,college bands haven't been competitive for 3+ decades. Most high school marching bands are more competitive than college bands.,They don't DO field shows. They do football shows.,sousaphones weigh just a little more than half as much as a contra. And you only get to balance a contra on one shoulder.,all of these activities go on past high school. You know that, right?,Pic is the trophies my band won this year. This was before the end of the season, too. I think we totaled out at 34 trophies. Was a good season. Didn't get to do BoA and go to grand nationals this year though because lack of funding :(. Still an awesome senior year.,Grow up,Obviously your band didn't teach you any life lessons beyond how to march and play. Enjoy applying it you insecure faggot,Floridian marching masterrace reporting in,Rest RIP in Pieces Teal Sound ;_;,I loved their show this year.,Film Noir 2011,SCSU for life.,I have gained so much respect for NSU (Norfolk State) after this video. I mean, it's 2009 but whatever.,SCSU ESPN vs. NSU DIRTY DIANA,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0yG,That's kind of weird. Because a lot of California High School programs are not only way harder on their students than most Universities, they're also A LOT fucking cleaner. ,But yeah, watching some of SDSU's shows I don't see any evidence that they put in nearly as much effort as the California high schools I've seen around.,(The reason this is the case is not because of the talent of the players or whatever, it's the fact college band directors are told to put on entertaining stuff by alumni and the president, whereas high school band directors want to stroke their own cocks and win trophies.),If you wanna spin, Pioneer will always take you in. Having that one year of experience will help you in future auditions, and most Pio vets end up leaving and going top 16 the next year. The corps has a reputation of being a ""feeder corps"". And you will learn something there as it's Onyx Guard staff (And they're super cool). ,That being said, don't expect to win anything. And believe it or not, nobody will give you shit for marching Pio unless you manage to be some douche about it. You'd probably make fun of Pio than people outside the corps do.,I played in a California HS Marching band.,Got plenty of 1st place trophies. And even traveled to London to march back in HS.,One of my euphonium/trombone playing friends, when they went off to college, told me how their band or marching band program is completely student run, and a lot of fun.,Some CA school...can't remember which ,Just varies on schools and regions, I guess.,I'm living in the south now, and I've seen some amazing college drumlines and marching bands.,That's pretty cool, I met some viz staff guys who work with some schools out there while I was on tour over the summer.,Where in the south are you at? I'm from Georgia personally, march at GSU (state not southern). You get a chance to see Jacksonville State from Alabama yet? They're pretty legit, despite a few of their horn players marching out of time.,How do I get involved in this thread? Do I discuss my love of Marching Band and shit? Or make a BOLD statement like.

"Guys this is my board. I bought it second hand and its seen better days. I'm looking to buy a new one so I need help. I am a beginner and can't do many tricks. I wear a size 8.5 us. Any suggestions,My suggestion;,What size board do you suggest. Also how do I ollie higher?,no m8. they went downhill and their quality is total shit right now.,I had 7 Girl decks by now, they are my favorite, highly recommend them. ,Depends what you're doing, A 8"" plus is good for starting and cruising, anything under 8"" would be suitable for flip tricks (so kickflips and upward) If you're starting out I would say get around an 8"",To ollie higher it's just a matter of practise, just try and jump higher and try to lift your knees to your chest, you want to get a good 'pop' on your board. A good griptape will help your foot stay on the board when sliding up so that'll help as well.,I still think they're the best wheels out there, those and bones wheels are the shit,Forgot to mention if you're willing to pay more for a deck I would highly recommend enjoi, they're decks are the shit and they're graphics are one of a kind,ill ignore the fact that youre underage, but enjoi is chinese. nobody wants that.,Suit yourself, I still think their decks are great for flip tricks,that doesnt happen. did you just start out? thats fine if you did, but eventually youll realize thats all very silly.,I've not been skating for decades but I've not just started out either, what I meant by that is larger and heavier decks are a lot harder to flip trick on. For example I used to have a Heathen deck which I'm pretty sure was in the 8"" range and that was noticeably harder to perform tricks because of it's size and weight, although my enjoi deck is light and quite small so it's easier to trick on.,its very old. i wouldnt. are you on an extremely right budget or something?,Yeah...,That has absolutely nothing to do with the brand, that comes down to the size. All brands offer different sizes.,7.75 in. wide deck (maybe 8.0),Indy's (149's would probably fit best),Wheels don't really matter to me, you could probably keep the ones you currently have if they aren't flatspotted.

"Post the shoes you skate in. Add details about how long they last and how the board feel is.,Vans Era Pro Classics,$50,I love them. Excellent board feel, but they only lasted about two weeks of every day skating (1-3 hour sessions) and lots of flatground before holes went through to my socks. Which is good for Vans in my experience, but I wish they could have gone longer. The rubber around the ollie and toe area lasted a long time though. That extra layer they added to the Pro Classics really helps.,But they're light, comfortable with just enough padding, gel insole, soft sock liner, and they're flexible like Vans Authentics but last longer since they're not canvas.,I might either get these again, go for whatever suede Vans I can find at the outlet, or go all out and buy the DC Mike Mo,Oh I forgot to mention, they wore quicker when I did nollies and heelflips because I drag harder on those tricks. My kickflips and ollies don't drag so hard. I do varial flips wrong, so when I do those I also drag my toe too hard and split my shoes very quickly.,Or maybe I do them right because my toe drags to flip the board as it spins. The board is almost upside down as my front foot kicks out.,These are the shoes that I've been skating, recently got a new pair of DVS that I haven't been able to skate yet. They are Vans Half Cabs, mine are a different color and from the picture I can't tell the exact construction if they are the same or not.

"How to run a successful skate shop? The owner of the only skateshop in my town is barely getting by and his morale seems pretty low, he mite go under. I want to take his place and give it a shot. Anyone have experience? Want advice from past/present owners of skate/snow/surf shop and just small shops in general.,Basically you need a lot of customers. If it's a small shop in a small town that isn't gonna happen.,We have a skate shop that's been around for quite some time now, and the way I see them doing business is by pushing themselves as a clothing/shoe store outwardly. Like, they're definitely a skate shop at their core and keep all the brands that are popular locally in stock, but they always have a big table of sale shoes and stuff on the street in front of the shop and run deals on clothes and stuff all the time.,I'd say you can't be successful as a 100% pure skate shop unless you're in the middle of one of the hot spots and have been established for ages already. You need to strike a balance between what has mainstream appeal and viability to support the skate end of things. Really you have to love it and be willing to not make quite as much money as you could running a different kind of store. Mad respect to those that care enough to keep them alive though, I can't put into words how much better I feel about setting up a deck at the local shop as opposed to ordering crap online from super faceless megacorp.,so i every other independently owned shop. the whole industry isnt doing that well.,The sad thing is that running a local skate shop just isn't going to make you a big profit. Wholesale boards and parts aren't very cheap, lots of shops make 10 bux or less per deck they sell and they just can't compete with mall shops putting good product on sale for really cheap. Like good decks on sale for 30 bux with free grip, locals just can't match it.,Make it a bar/cafe and a skateshop combined, a place for skaters to hang out when not skating (and posers),You should try and do skate jams and games of skate as much as possible. My old shop used to do that back in the day and everyone would come out. Offer deals maybe once a month, and besides that just try and spread word around and get the kids who frequent the shop to try and help popularize,you could make it work if you expanded beyond just skateboards. i grew up in shit small town ohio and we had a bike/skate shop and was the only place around that sold a decent bike or board.,funny thing was, almost everyone bought they're bikes or boards from there, because your only other option was k mart, walmart etc.,another thing to keep in mind is don't rely souley on the people willing to pay top dollar for everything. not everyone wants to spend 150 on the deck alone, keep a versitle stock form beginner to advanced. your average mom buying a board for her 12 year old son will drop $200 for a complete board. hell i remember saving up for months for this sexy as hell board for $70 dollars.,plus remember what keeps an independent business great, your a member of the community serving the community. you got a regular customer thats short a couple bucks? get me back next time, you'd be amazed how often a loyal customer will come back just to drop off that $5 he owes you.,the average mom WON'T spend 200 on a board. gotta correct myself here.,Jams are definitely a great idea. If you have room to build some ramps and rails and stuff out back that'd also be awesome.,My local skate shop closed down last season. He said the only thing keeping him afloat was longboards and clothing for chicks.,Sad to say but skateshops aren't a very lucrative business. Seldom will an area have enough skaters to support a business based solely off of them.,It is probably necessary to get money from non skaters like all the frat Chads getting into longboarding and chicks buying expensive designer clothes. ,Sad but it has to happen, myself being a dedicated skater will only spend ~60$ a month at a skateshop.,skateshops don't sell expensive or designer clothes breh,sell everything scooter shit and snowsports are huge money makers and you';ll have business in the winter months with snowsports,and dont alienate your core with the stuck up i own a skateshop additude and you should be set,therre's a snow/skate shop in my neighborhood been open for over 25 yrs. i think mostly due to their snowsports income it went from skate store to snow store with lil corner for skate shit. organize charters repairs and board waxing adds up. even people who dont snowsport would come into your store to pick up jackets and stuff. basically you wont survive if you just sell skae ,shit look at blades in the city if you been there in the 90's and been there now you will have a good idea on were your money will come from ,temperature ,dont,Good idea.,The bar/skateshop idea is great. It's perfect, it'd attract all kinds of people not only real skaters but hipsters and posers would eat this shit right up. ,But it's kind of a negative thing. I don't drink myself, so I wouldn't want to hurt my local skate community by possibly causing one of the <21 youngian an alcoholic or something. I want to support myself and keep them skating, not make them athletically peek at 25.,Dat stolen Conan Obrien joke,Another thing would be to know you're shit, be able to chat with customers about riders, decks brands etc and give good advice.,the majority of your customers will be little kids with their mothers. thats just the way it is, and you just cut out your biggest demographic. its an awful idea.,Depending on what sort of town you're in and what region there's a lot of different stuff you could try.,Are there places to ski/snowboard near you? Sell snowboards and related gear in the winter,A couple other people have said apparel etc, thats basically necessary,The shop I usually go to is in the university part of my town and every month the district has an art walk. So they do a raffle and have a free keg for everyone who shows up. They take all the free vendor shit they get and raffle it off, use the raffle money to pay for the keg every month and enjoy having a packed house for a night. They also let local artists sell their pieces in the store. They had one night where every artist painted a deck and they sold those.,That relies on how much density you can get in your area, so if you're in a small town with no college in it or anything you might have some trouble. The key, as with any business, is to make it either the best or only place to get something you're selling. Doesn't have to be everything but you should at least be the place to go for something that everyone in your demographic needs,business economics is not an alternative sport,I would argue its on topic enough to be posted here. what board would you say this belongs in more?,either advice or random. if i was opening a ""normal"" sporting goods store, i wouldn't post about it in /sp/,a skate shop is a lot more specialty than a sporting goods store. Sporting goods you have to just cover all your bases.,A skate shop you have to specialize to make the business work, so posting on a board designed to discuss that specific sport (among other things) makes sense.,If I were opening a small specialty clothing store I would consider making a post of /fa/. A gun store, /k/. Hell i'd make a post in /diy/ if I was openning a hardware store. OP is looking for ideas to make a skate shop work. This board is where people interested in skating would go. It makes sense to ask here, its his target demographic,To be honest,I think if the mahority don't have an issue with discussing how would be best to run a Skate shop, then its not an issue.,Its like , said, a skate shop is a lot more personal and specialised than a ganeral sporting goods store,Have a ton of special events with prizes, maybe one or two every month, and you can never advertise too much. At my local shop/park a shit ton of people who even live far away always come.,are you implying that you are going to wait for the local shop to go under and then try your luck at your own shop? if so, you're an idiot and a dick.,first off, why not help the shop owner? if his morale is getting lower its clear that he has put a lot into that shop because he cares about skating and the community, help him out you fucking selfish pig. ,second, if you don't help out and the shop does go under, you're going to have to start from scratch instead of just fixing some things with the other shop to get it back up and running. ,if you are in fact planning to pitch ideas to the store owner with the shop and work with him then that's fine but don't take the mans place.,I work in a store that sells lots of clothes, outside gear and shit, and then there is the shop. It makes it so people can be going in for one thing and decide, hey my fat ass grandchild might like this. That keeps it afloat so you can have the actual skaters come in and check shit out. The big thing is decide how much you let people stand on them and stuff",,"03/28/13(Thu)11:55,03/28/13(Thu)12:09,03/28/13(Thu)15:22,03/28/13(Thu)15:25,03/28/13(Thu)15:35,03/28/13(Thu)16:02,03/28/13(Thu)16:04,03/28/13(Thu)16:21,03/28/13(Thu)16:22,03/28/13(Thu)16:36,03/28/13(Thu)16:40,03/28/13(Thu)16:49,03/28/13(Thu)16:49,03/28/13(Thu)16:52,03/28/13(Thu)21:44,03/28/13(Thu)21:52,03/28/13(Thu)21:58,03/28/13(Thu)22:03,03/28/13(Thu)22:08,03/28/13(Thu)22:16,03/28/13(Thu)22:37,03/28/13(Thu)22:49,03/28/13(Thu)22:54,03/28/13(Thu)22:57,03/28/13(Thu)23:03,03/28/13(Thu)23:32,03/28/13(Thu)23:54,03/30/13(Sat)21:52,03/30/13(Sat)21:58","Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,ThreaKlller , ,03/28/13(Thu)15:35 ,ThreaKlller,!H1HTK6APw.,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,[Insulting Style Comment],[Insulting Style Comment],Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"

"Could you call Milsim a sport?,,and why/why not,(what is milsim?: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milsim,it's more of a form of a specialized form of LARPing. Several forms of LARPing have rules and this is just one of them,bunch of /asp/ies that were too pussy to join, or med/legal DQed,I can talk all the shit I want, I did my two tours of Iraq,its a fucking game. calm down,fuck you, I had to listen to two neckbeards talk about how much they knew about military tactics and them debating M16 vs AK and they had never even fired either one, let alone been shot at,shhh your /k/ is showing, /k/omrade,so you have to be shot at to discuss weapons and in the military to discuss tactics?,youre a fucking faggot if you believe that,Kudos to you, for staying to the subject.,one does require to have been in military, nor shot an actual weapon to know about tacticts.,but that aside, i have been and done both.,only someone with parochial sight in the mather would claim otherwise, and would be a fagget,Not that guy and I don't think you need to be in the military to discuss tactics, but I can just imagine two guys discussing M16 vs AK. I know those kinds of people. Everything they know about guns they learned from COD.,what about the faggots in charge of your military who have never been in a firefight but tell you what to do? where is your god now?,Yeah, I know the feeling listening to those types. I've had to listen to some CODsofters debate whether a gun was an M4 or an AR-15 for upwards of a half hour, and how awesome it would be to put an adjustable stock on a bullpup rifle.,New anon here.,As prior service I really don't know what to think of these guys.,Are they borderline militia?,Are they neckbeards that are one step above D&D?,Are they hardcore paintballers?,I think it would depend on the individual group. I'd either have respect for them or I'd have to smack them on the back of the head and tell them to go back to pokeman.,Slow down there tough guy,Don't get mad because you're dumb and they're not,I airsoft with guys I also go gun shooting, hunting, and camping with, and our airsoft guns are identical to our real ones, so I'd say we qualify for milsim. ,Other airsoftedrs find it weird that my group and I will often go a whole match never expending more than 50 BB's. Also we only use 30 round mags in our airsoft guns. No 500+ high caps.,Just throwing out the term ""Military Simulation"" is all too common, and it's usually misused. ,Really you can divide it up into a few categories, firstly there is which sport? You get Paintball, Airsoft and Re-enactment. Paintball being least realistic, and re-enactment being most. Then within each of these sports there are sub categories:,Firstly there is ""COMSIM"", simulating firefights/combat. Which is what most ""Airsoft Milsim"" games are, people want to run around and pew pew at each other. Everyone's essentially trying to be Arnold Schwarzenegger. While many players like to think they're ""super realistic leet oper8trs"" mostly they are just clueless morons like M7/Milsim Mechanix and realism has almost zero focus.,Secondly there is ""TACSIM"", tactical simulation. This is where most of the ""hardcore milsim"" guys sit, and there is a good mingling of current/ex serving personnel. TacSim takes it a step up in terms of realism. Players put a lot of focus into using proper tactics. Utilizing correct room clearing procedure as an easy example. But that goes for everything, from simple things like stacking properly to proper comms usage etc.,Then there is ""MILSIM"", which while the most common term, is actually the least common form of play. Milsim is getting it as close to 'reality' as possible. That means everything from accurate kit requirements to realistic ammo limits to proper comms usage to hauling 90lb bergens up mountains. MILSIM involves much less combat, lots of sitting around waiting, lots of walking, etc. It's somewhat closer to re-enactment in that sense, accuracy being a primary focus. As far as I know there are only at most a few of this sort of game in the US. Mostly they are over here in Europe. Some games in Eastern Europe, you can turn up on the first day of a 4 day Op, walk 10km with all your gear on to set up a FOB, get shot, no one casevac you, and then it's game over and you go home because there are no re-spawns.,milsim isn't a sport its done in loads of sports,you even get video game 'milsim',i don't understand why people do milsim in paintball. why dress up your marker as a real gun, but it doesn't behave anything like one?,i dunno, i think paintball guns should look like some sci-fi shit,I stopped paintball when I finally got laid which was around 14 years old. These dudes gotta grow up,Hah, you're cute. I'm engaged, get pussy all day, and still paintball.,Go fuck yourself, faggot.,Not that dude either. ,It's not that, it's just when they try to critique combat videos or try to act as if they've been there done that.,Paintball is A-Ok because it's (can be) an actual sport,And you think that'll continue? HAHAHA,If you only knew her libido...,But besides that, fuck you, Paintball doesn't need pricks like you anyways.,I like to think that Milsim guys are basically combining LARP and Airsoft. While the average guy who plays airsoft is in it just to shoot people and fuck around in a competitive environment, these people enjoy roleplaying while doing that.,I mean fuck, it's better than most fantasy LARP's out there. I'd rather shoot plastic bb's at people than hit them with a foam sword and yell out numbers.,I play scenario games. I prefer them more than speedball.,But i dont do the whole tactical thing.,80 acres. Last game had two teams with 565 people.,We have bases. You have to run to get drop boxes, which have mission cards in them.,Capture and hold missions.,Engineers can ""blow up"" bunkers and kill everyone inside them. and shoot nerf cannons at ""tanks"" (atv's boxed in with wood),Medics have cards with limited number of uses Headshots cant be revived. You have to call MEDIC and not move. They have to run to go help them.,Its plays for 2 days. from 12am to 12pm saturday. and then 9 am to 3pm the sunday with the last hour being everyone put on a small field for a crazy final battle.,I served and i agree that there are some people that take it kinda seriously and fulfill their fantasy of being in the military.,But i just let them be. I don't tell anybody i served. i find people who do that in public are attention whores.,but honestly scenario games are fun. The team work and all the little kids who are SOOO excited to be apart of the team and help out. They love it when the have a responsibility. Like ""cover me"" or ""run and take that base"".,tl;dr some people take milsim to cereal. don't let it ruin your day. and try out the scenario games, they're great big fun.,also i might add that it's not airsoft. its paintball.,they have a big game in Texas (near Houston) twice a year.,heres the next one.,http://www.txrpaintball.com/txrs-up",,"03/27/13(Wed)22:20,03/27/13(Wed)22:48,03/27/13(Wed)23:15,03/27/13(Wed)23:17,03/27/13(Wed)23:19,03/27/13(Wed)23:20,03/27/13(Wed)23:20,03/27/13(Wed)23:37,03/27/13(Wed)23:46,03/28/13(Thu)00:45,03/28/13(Thu)07:17,03/28/13(Thu)09:10,03/29/13(Fri)06:28,03/29/13(Fri)08:07,03/29/13(Fri)08:09,03/29/13(Fri)09:34,03/30/13(Sat)08:04,03/30/13(Sat)16:42,03/30/13(Sat)16:54,03/30/13(Sat)17:55,03/30/13(Sat)18:25,03/30/13(Sat)18:48,03/30/13(Sat)18:50,03/30/13(Sat)18:52,03/30/13(Sat)23:07,03/30/13(Sat)23:10,03/30/13(Sat)23:56,03/31/13(Sun)00:02","Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"
"They already have a recurve thread, so can we have a compound thread? ,PSE Nova with carbon express ,Scott Silverhorn release ,Mid-level,Recreational shooter looking to begin competition,Nobody shoots compound? Sad...,I love archery, but I don't see the point in compound bow competitions. They're great for hunting, and they're fun to shoot, but you have all these ""cheater"" devices that cut down on the skill required to properly use the bow. Counter weights, arrow guides, peep sights, low hold weight, release triggers. It's technology and it makes you a better shot, which is great for hunting, but I think it leaves little room for skill development or growth. To me, it's just a goofy looking gun with a big, slow bullet.,I agree with you completely, but if you have disabilities or an injury like me than its the only way to get into archery.,Recurve totally doesn't have those, roight,I'm an amateur and haven't held a bow in several years, but I was always told to never bend the arm that's holding the bow.

Different strokes for different folks lad.,Not that impressive bro, I can even shoot that on a recurve and I started shooting this september,This,Put you in a wood. Give you a block of stone. Make me a compound. With a decent yew stave I can make a longbow. Maybe. :P,Although I do know what you mean. But I feel a much better connection to a longbow than I ever did to a recurve or compound.,Also, there are plenty of barebow archers who often get 540 on portsmouths, at the UK Uni championships I know someone who was using a wooden, twisted old club bow and shot 475ish barebow..,Ok not to tear you apart guy but... A recurve is just a faster longbow. Unless you get them HEX Border limbs or a Static recurve in which you get even more for your draw. Even a target built recurve is still holding draw weight and releasing an arrow. Compounds are the only different kind of bow. ,Also, 540 portsmouth is hilariously bad, even barebow. I know people who shoot barebow, 560 on a FITA 18. I shoot about 500 barebow on a FITA 18 myself. ,The reason people don't take archery seriously as a sport is the attitude you've displayed just there. YOU don't take it seriously enough, why should an outsider?",,"03/20/13(Wed)21:44,03/20/13(Wed)22:10,03/20/13(Wed)22:18,03/20/13(Wed)22:27,03/21/13(Thu)06:13,03/21/13(Thu)08:50,03/21/13(Thu)10:54,03/21/13(Thu)11:27,03/21/13(Thu)13:29,03/21/13(Thu)16:21,03/21/13(Thu)19:12,03/21/13(Thu)19:16,03/21/13(Thu)20:20,03/22/13(Fri)00:40,03/22/13(Fri)03:28,03/22/13(Fri)03:42,03/22/13(Fri)10:56,03/22/13(Fri)11:28,03/22/13(Fri)15:25,03/22/13(Fri)15:58,03/22/13(Fri)16:19,03/22/13(Fri)22:37,03/23/13(Sat)20:37,03/23/13(Sat)20:41,03/24/13(Sun)13:23,03/24/13(Sun)19:55,03/24/13(Sun)20:09,03/24/13(Sun)20:24,03/24/13(Sun)22:07,03/26/13(Tue)09:30,03/26/13(Tue)21:57,03/27/13(Wed)13:16,03/27/13(Wed)21:10,03/27/13(Wed)21:58,03/29/13(Fri)09:23,03/29/13(Fri)17:12,03/31/13(Sun)00:35","Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"

Is he supposed to be hated like JBL was back during his reign?,A fat what?,Best diva of all time,+5,loli divas,Do You Even Lift?,You type like if you were 16. People like punk because he's one the best heels today and because his most famous promo gave WWE the rush it desperately needed while containing some backstage truths. Get worked more, filthy face casual,No,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OS9,Punk's promo gave it the shot it needed but leave it to WWE to try their best to stop it. That promo should have shot punk to superstardom on the levels of SCSA or the rock but WWE did their best to make sure that didn't happen cause GOTTA PUSH CENA HARDER.,Speaking as a flithy casual, Cena is by far the most fun, charismatic wrestler I've seen. To be fair, I missed the glory days of The Rock and other such stars, but nothing gets me smiling like hearing Cena's walk in song.,In an interview, punk said the build up he built with that promo was absolutely huge, and he would have preferred to stay out of WWE instead of coming back so quick, but they lacked a summer slam main event, and that's why they bringed him back so fast. A damn shame,what are you, 12?,Is Lucha allowed in rasslin general?,I was back when I watched wrestling, which I base that statement off of.,no,Of course, so is amateur wrestling.,Is Biggie Langston a gay?,I for one welcome lucha libre instead of more divas shitposting.,Is the man with the most 5 star matches in wrestling allowed?,Possibly.,stop posting,AJ Best Diva,Kaitie 2nd Best,lel,Currently?

I currently only have Fire Pro Wrestling Returns, WWF Wrestlemania 2000 and WWF No Mercy,I'd rather watch Scotty 2 Hotty over Lita.,lol She's not that bad.,Scotty 2 Hotty's performance in his match against Dean Malenko from Backlash 2000 was better than any Lita performance I've seen despite the fact that Dean carried him. S2H is also a better wrestler than Davey Richards too.,Sold! Time to find this match.,the ending was really good imo,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abke,http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2,I have no idea what I did to him. I've always put him in high profile feuds and pretty much put him over all the time and yet he's unhappy.,hes just not ready brother(jackdude),I feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeel it,Brother, Generico is the most over star in my ROH company with 100 over..Only Roderick Strong is equal to Generico. Yep, not Steen, not Cabana, not Callihan but bland Roddy.,Was Malenko the worlds tallest midget?,DBry had crazy pops post WM28. Not sure if he's still as hot. Would like to see him pushed though.,Was 1995 Dean's best year in the United States?,He had the crazy pops, got a well deserved feud with CM Punk over the WWE title that was ruined by AJ, now stuck in a comedy midcard.,He is being pushed. He's in the most over tag team in WWE. If you mean as a singles wrestler, then yeah. But, I want him to break up with Kane and I want them to feud. I don't even care if its a Tag champ vs Tag champ for the tag titles type of gimmick. I hope they have a long drawn out feud if it happens though. WWE has this awful problem with just dropping storylines with no follow up.,Also watching this Scotty/Dean match I miss when WWE actually created sets and set pieces for the PPVs,Did he ever. The YES chants were running wild.,They need to let him wrestle ROH style for a bit and kick people's heads in.,Speaking of this match. Where the is the Light Heavyweight title? And I'd like to see the hardcore title back too.,good lord, whoever made svr06 either hates videogames or wrestling or possibly both,bryan was crazy over after wm28. its a pity wwe didnt capitalize and put a title on him instead of turning him into another catch phrase machine ,i would cum buckets if wwe let him kick heads in and be a rule breaking motherfucker again,WWE retired the Light Heavyweight Title on 11/30/2001,retired. maybe when based haitch takes over we'll get it back.,If they were to let him cut loose, he'd be bigger than Cena, and we can't have that.,They need to let him have a bit of a serious run ala ECW Kurt Angle.,That bad?,Disgusting. They need to bring it back. So the undercard wrestlers can have a title to fight for instead of being jobbers for the midcard/uppercard,i would rather see wwe hire more flippy japanese guys and have a junior heavyweight title,Who is that?,They can't even handle the flippy mexican guys,Kurt had this wrestling machine gimmick for a bit in WWECW. With black ring attire and mouth protector and all that shit. Totally stopped comedy and worked all matches stiff as shit.,Kurt Angle was at his absolute best in 2001.,well I just lost someone else's tag team titles in a handicap match after 15 minutes of choke slamming edge and christian. maybe they just don't know the meaning of the word difficulty. or narrative.,I really need to get this game. Is the storyline this eventful?,Kurt had some great matches. And now..he's in TNA soooooo...yeah,w-where did gayda went to? ,i didn't meant to be a huge asshole ;_;,Better TNA than 6' under.,I think that the problem with DB is that he likes the spotlight too much. He doesn't make his opponents shine, at all, and is constantly on the offensive.,Dragon gate wrestlers would be perfect. ,Well, Japanese wrestlers typically aren't restricted to one style of wrestling. Most of them would be sent off overseas to europe, America, Mexico to be exposed to different styles and to learn to wrestle different styles. They adapt well.,If anything, it's the WWE trained wrestlers who need to be more exposed to other kinds of wrestling instead of the bland generic style.,You hurt his feelings man.,Are you sure you're not talking about Cena?,True. I don't think anyone besides DB and Punk could wrestle one of those guys. Ehh, maybe Del rio too but that's about it.,I'd like to see this man wrestle both Punk and DB.,Who in the blue hell?,His name is Kengo Mashimo. He works for K-Dojo.,Kengo Mashimo. I myself don't know much about him except he wrestled Shinsuke Nakamura once and is part of suzukigun.,I did hear he's a pretty good talent with a nice heel charisma.,I need to check out some matches then.,Anyone ever listen to any wrasslin' podcasts?,just about anyone can have a great match with someone wrestling with a japanese influenced style like punk, dbd and seth rollins, its proof that the japanese style works better the the american rasslin' which wwe seems to only be teaching there developmental guys rather than teaching them a variety of styles that mesh with one-another,Here are some Kengo Mashimo matches that you guys should watch.,http://www.veoh.com/watch/v753968yZ,seems like they have a few dozen storylines you can go through in the career mode, i'm only a coupla hours in. I'm kinda torn on my opinion as this is the first game I've picked up in months that has completely kicked my candy ass, I keep having to look up the controls and keep missing moves or punching the ref due to weird lock-on/hit detection,Nope. But, I do watch PWR, OTRS and NoDQ on youtube.,If thats the case I hope they do bring some japanese guys in. The question is will they be over with the fans? Because WWE is all about the money.,Good shit, I'm going to watch these now,Nice, I haven't even completed WWF No mercy 100% yet after the CAW glitch erasing all of my saves. I wouldn't mind playing another challenging WWE game.,If they push the guys as legitimate contenders, no reason why they can't get over. They probably wouldn't be able to cut promos so hide that weakness and focus on the positives they bring.,Whether we get to see top tier talent is another question though. Guys like Tanahashi, Okada, Nakamura are probably happy to stay in NJPW where they earn a good amount, wrestle less dates and are treated with respect by the company.,Who were the last japanese wrestlers WWE brought in? I think it was Yoshi Tatsu and Kenzo Suzuki. Yoshi while talented was just a midcard guy in Japan, Kenzo was blackballed for a while from Japan for being involved in the death of a wrestler.,Tensai!!!!,But in all seriousness yeah I wouldn't mind if they brought these guys in. Actually they should bring them all in so they can have a better tag team division.,the game's too easy on easy and the computer counters 80% of everything and ramps up the pace on normal it's pretty frustrating playing with a fresh CAW with shitty stats,all i can think of is kaientai and that is not a good thing,You can't edit your stats?,░░░░░░░▄▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▄▄░░░░░░░░░,░░░░▄▀▀░░░░░░░░░░░░░▀▄░░░░░░░,░░▄▀░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░▀▄░░░░░,░░█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░▀▄░░░,░▐▌░░░░░░░░▄▄▄▄▄▄▄░░░░░░░▐▌░░,░█░░░░░░░░░░░▄▄▄▄░░▀▀▀▀▀░░█░░,▐▌░░░░░░░▀▀▀▀░░░░░▀▀▀▀▀░░░▐▌░,█░░░░░░░░░▄▄▀▀▀▀▀░░░░▀▀▀▀▄░█░,█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░▀░░░▐░░░░░▐▌,▐▌░░░░░░░░░▐██▀█▄░░░░░░█▀█░▐▌,░█░░░░░░░░░░░▀▀▀░░░░░░▀▀▀▀░▀▄,░▐▌░░░░▄░░░░░░░░░░░░░▌░░░░░░█,░░▐▌░░▐░░░░░░░░░░░░░░▀▄░░░░░█,░░░█░░░▌░░░░░░░░▐▀░░░░▄▀░░░▐▌,░░░▐▌░░▀▄░░░░░░░░▀░▀░▀▀░░░▄▀░,░░░▐▌░░▐▀▄░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█░░,░░░▐▌░░░▌░▀▄░░░░▀▀▀▀▀▀░░░█░░░,░░░█░░░▀░░░░▀▄░░░░░░░░░░▄▀░░░,░░▐▌░░░░░░░░░░▀▄░░░░░░▄▀░░░░░,░▄▀░░░▄▀░░░░░░░░▀▀▀▀█▀░░░░░░░,yea but it's based on an exp system i'm about at all 5's right now,You can't ""cheat"" and win by count out?,hnnng,not the way 2/3 of the matches are set up,Went to the Rocky Horror Picture Show #YOLO ,What did I miss,I am late!

I always thought Rey vs UD was a no brainer. We NEVER got to see him do SHIT.,I KNEW that would be a gif. Knew it. Thank you.,I say they keep Rey off TV for a year so he doesn't injure himself and get Cara on Rosetta Stone so he can cut a promo and try next year for a Rey/Cara passing the torch program for a New Cruiserweight title now they they have enough flippy guys to support a division.,They should have Rey and Sin Cara have a mask vs mask match and have Rey lose,It's like we've never seen Rey unmasked.,muh merch,they should hire El Hijo del Rey Misterio to keep that gravy train running ,that reminds me I need to buy a La Parka mask.,most haven't because the audience is mostly little kids, and it was 15 years ago, he probably looks all ugly now,http://youtu.be/605R_DAcbG4,http://youtu.be/TmL7Vb1dOcs,Anyone remember these? they were fucking hilarious,damnit book get it together,I got as far as the evil bitch hostess saying ""weakeslink"" before remembering why I never watched that show in the first place, so no :|,Del Rio vs Swagger will be the opener. Swagger will go for a dirty win with his manager and get counter by a dirty move by del rio's announcer with Del Rio picking up a dirty win. Ziggler will run out and successfully cash in. Cena Rock Main event, Cena will win. Taker will continue the streak, Kane and Dbry will retain. The shield will (and should) win. Don't remember the rest of the card.,Best Diva was Stacy Keibler.,Ziggler and Cesaro deserve the biggest pushes by a long mile.,Punk is just another spoke on the wheel, as he said himself, and mostly does what he's told by people that matter.,Really dissapointed that there was no rhodes rivalry after rumble. Also, as far as I know Jericho isn't on the card? I find it hard to care about this years mania after Ziggler was eliminated in the rumble. They built him up as the next Jericho, gave him number 1 entry, had him cut 2 promos in the same night, 1 saying he would unify the titles again. I was a believer and Vince fucked me as he does all believers.,Sincerely and hopefully doubt it.,He's got a match with Fandango, which I'm curious to see.,True dat. Cesaro ain't worth shit on the mic, though.,True dat.,Ah, Fandango. Well. Fandango will win. I didn't give a fuck about Fandango until he came out a week or so ago and cut a promo about not wrestling because they couldn't say his name. Got to admit I was pretty surprised and impressed with his mic skills. I'm interested.,How do you fuck that up?,At least they're not shitting on the shield. Every match I think they're going to get fucked. I was truely shocked and amazed when they beat super shaemus and super cena and gol-ryback,Ziggle should cash in to face the rock,He can't, only eligible for Del Rio's title.,that title is worthless,I know. It's what the intercontinental should be, which really says something about the IC titles current state.,Odds for Rustlemania,Cena 1/14,Undertaker 1/18,Del Rio 3/10,Triple H 2/7,Ryback 2/9,Fandango 2/5,Zig E 4/9,The Shield 2/9,Most predictable Rustlemania ever edition.,I don't think Zig E is winning. I think Dolph cashes in. ,Shield will win but only because one of the faces will turn, likely Orton. Orton is the leader of Shield I think,I'd fuck Gayda,Del Rio is going to retain and be a champion 'till ER,Can't see Zigg-E dethroning Hell No. Booking Langston's first match at Wrestlemania is kudos enough for the guy, they're not going to slap a title on him as well.,Bow down to the Funk, baby.,they should make a skit where mark henry climbs the empire state and screams THATS WHAT I DOOO,it would be a good way to keep them both relevant without a cash in and it helps break hell no up, whilst keeping the tag division propped up with talent. I think Zig E lee is happening.,CM Punk was right,I think it is more likely that Doplh and AJ walk out with belts.,having kane turn back ""evil"" after paul bearer's death would be a good opportunity to split hell no up and have them both come out of a strong feud with an out of control kane and his former partner and friend looking to put him down. so how will they fuck it up/miss this opportunity?,That is how I would book it but I have a feeling that WWE will have D-Bry be the one who goes heel. Ideally Kane should go heel and D-Bry will be the underdog who eventually wins. ,BAM you have a legit looking face.,i see them having dbry go face and lose to kane, to have a monster kane for cena to overcome later, and dbry to drop down to IC/US level to help build cesaro/barrett into main eventers and to give the miz a feud at a later date.,I don't see Barrett making it out of WM with his title,it will be good to free him up for an eventual world title push,Maybe. Problem is I don't think Barrett is over enough for any sort of big push. I like the guy though, don't get me wrong.,Big-E isnt over enough i dont think. Besides a guy like Ryback has been longer in the tooth and doesnt have a title match at Mania,lul,Ziggler way walk out of mania with a title as the result of a cash-in,no he'll drop it, but he won't be elevated either, hes going to be stuck there for the rest of this year, they will need a main event heel for RAW though, if punk really is to take time off after mania. lesnar is part time, the rock will be gone after ER so someone has to occupy that slot, not sure who it will be, kane seems a good choice if they handle it well.,that world title scene seems awfully crowded:,ADR,Swagger,Ziggler,Ryback,Henry,Sheamus,Orton,big show,add barrett to that and you've got a lot of dudes all vying for that one title, many of whom are ""favourites"" of the bossmen. barrett will stay midcard, i think.,Either Orton, or Sheamus is going to be that heel. My money is on Orton.,yeah i think that's where the smart money is. I think the shield will eventually get fed to cena post rock, but hopefully we're talking autumn, gives them time to establish the shield members individually before the split.,Kane could work too for the record but I see him elevating D-Bry more than Cena. he would be better served with Bryan anyway,Agreed. I think Orton w/The Shield will be the main antagonists for Cena post-mania,in an ideal world, Dbry comes out looking strong, but in his own words, vince doesn't like him, so i do not hold out much hope,I would like to see the shield remain independant of any one on the main roster, i don't want their momentum being given to someone else, those three guys fucking everyone up should get the attention.,i couldnt see him holding onto that beard for much longer either,If Vince doesn't like him he sure has a weird way of showing it. He is all over TV. During the Anger Management stuff he easily had more segments than even the champ.,it's because dbry = cash,smarks love him, kids love him and goddamn can he wrestle he's a win-win-win,The time will come when you need to split the Shield up. ,Rollins could become face, Ambrose needs to stay heel, and Reigns could stick around as muscle for Orton. ,Probably not a perfect scenario but I can't see anything else right now.,in that case id like to see them on equal footing with orton and not as underlings. they have an all for one and one for all thing going, they shouldn't shit on that for ortons benefit.,For sure. They shouldn't do a repeat of Legacy. Hell, one of them could even feud with Orton after they are done with Cena.,bets? on fake wrestling? nigga you high,It's moreso a bet on ""who do you think the boss likes more and is going to have win"".,Which is why it was such a tongue-in-cheek thing to say, because said bosses bizarre preferences have made this one of the most depressingly predictable Wrestlemania's in a while.,Don't bother,To smarks, not giving a wrestler their own television show and 100-0 win streak means that Vince is burying them,I don't get why everyone wants the Hell No breakup to lead to a Bryan-Kane feud. We already had that, remember? That's what started the angle, and Bryan won clean in the last match. Leave it there, and have the breakup be amicable.,Then give Bryan a main event feud again. He's a proud submission specialist and Cena's the guy who Never Gives Up. Shit writes itself.,he's like the perfect package,He may have done it by choice.,He's still got the Generico character if this stint in WWE doesn't work out.,Remember when the Dudley Boyz couldn't be the Dudley Boyz anymore?,fuck this planet,i think they are keeping the Generico character under wraps for his NXT stuff for the most part. If he gets on Smackdown or RAW I expect to see him masked.,Daniel Bryan,Some of the speculation from /r/SquaredCircle over on readit is that the E wants to see if Generico can work without the gimmick, the moveset, and the appeal. If he can't work without the mask, then he won't work period. It's very reasonable for them to make him do this.,Vince is stubborn old cunt,Well, I guess they just want to make sure that if in case he turns stale (not very likely), then they can repackage him. Yes, there is Cena and his five moves of doom (and many other popular superstars who offer predictable choreography), but he's a big draw, and Generico is coming from an indie fed that has its own audience. This could have been a pricey acquisition, and Vince wants to make sure that it's worthwhile.,He's a retard so,goddamn, i'm so glad I stopped watching wrestling from 2000-2010, what a horrible decade for the business.,he's too over brother, it would take too much time. and he's way over with the smarks.,Kane can be heel,i need sauce on this. when did this happen?,Sheamus fighting with lumber jacks. not sure of anything else. He seems like a face in this one,congrats, you've found the one man that could possibly turn Kane, too bad he works one day a year and is probably done after this WM.,CM Punk can turn Kane heel. Kane is pissed about CM Punk disrespecting the urn, then it's revealed that Kane was on Punk's side, Kane turns on Punk, Punk is face and Kane is heel,THAT would make me buy the PPV,Nope, he's confirmed at least for a Smackdown taping in England.,So if I started a steam group for Wrasslin' general, would that make watching RAW and 'Mania easier?,Thoughts?,Maybe, we should test it,WE WCW NOW,Biker Undertaker was such a natural fit since that's how he is in real life. He even made his bike stalling look intentional that one time.,I'll make it in a bit.,They want Ryback to be Goldberg 2.0,He should have kept that gimmick. The ""Dead Man Walking"" gimmick is just too out there,Ok,I like you, even though you're a tripfag and don't have a dick,Cena heel/injury heel confirmed,Thank you, Anon. ,Means a lot,Really?! I WANT THIS,I'm convinced the staff doesn't know what the hell they're doing with this angle,Hopefully they just go with the fan's thoughts and turn Cena heel,Cena has the mic skills to carry it out,Hogan 2.0,Are there any huge face stables?,Gayda should be the valet for the face stable,Too heel to be face, bitches,Here is what is going happen, imo.,CM Punk will turn back from heel and drop Heyman after losing to Taker,Heyman is rescued by The Shield and they bury CM Punk on Raw,http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CE,No. CM Punk SHOULD NOT have a feud with The SHIELD. If anything, when Bork beat Haitch hopefully he stays long enough to feud with punk after Punk drops Haymen,Nice,O-okay...,I feel like Punk should take over the Shield, but that would probably result in Nexus 2.0. Personally, I'm liking how the Shield are wild attack dogs who ultimately do their own thing.,Relative newfag to rasslin here. When I started watching, Kofi was ICC and on raw every week, winning all his matches. The all of a sudden they turned him into jobber supreme. Who'd he piss off/what'd he do?,He just started getting boring. Last week he was on the pre-show and was struggling with PRIMO. Epico didn't even interfere, Kofi was having a hard time as it is.,with my advanced searching skills (ahem) i found that this gif is from a lumberjack match between the team of Ziggler, Swagger and Tensai; and the team of super-buddies, John Cena and Sheamus. From May 2012 Raw.,Detective has spoken.,you are AWESOME,I think it's a bit too late for that. They had that chance to tie Punk and Paul to the Shield but they blew it with that dumb ass backstage segment.,Kofi has always been a jobber,OHHHH GURL,My sides,That's lame.,Hopefully they do lose so they can finally break up and feud.,Sin Cara is very popular in Mexico though,i hope Team Biggler will win because it will be easier to break up Team Hell No that way.,Also, considering that Ziggler's MITB case will lead him to the WHC before July, we will be able to see Michaels & Diesel 2.0,win-win situation for both teams.,True, but he's shit in WWE.,I'm not sure what to make the picture because the last one got taken down. I was going to use Christy Hemme with T.W.O. censorship,Best theme in the history of WWE:,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf3Y,I know, it's a damn shame. I was hoping he would go more with the ""I was screwed"" angle and join with the shield to attack Vince. Have him even put Vince in the Sharpshooter for MUH SUBTLE IRONY,I keep forgetting that he's a luchador because every time I see that mask I think Tokuatsu,That would've been great. And I really thought thats were it was going.,Ok boys!,NEW THREAD,NEW THREAD,NEW THREAD,NEW THREAD,NEW THREAD,NEW THREAD,NEW THREAD,Make the picture a botch,Sin Cara just has a Mexican style

A debuting NXT talent may be a good choice for this. Have them fight regularly on televised shows, with the new arrival getting his own internet show and proclaiming himself the new WWE Internet Champion as a means of goading Ryder into the ring, and then taking his vanity belt hostage.,well I've been watching ""The Best of Smackdown and Raw"" 2011 and 2012.

I have only been doing Judo twice a week for about a year but after a while, some muscle memory sinks in. My advise is to learn four throws and practice them religiously for as long as it take. Practice them to the right and to the left. Always start slow....,Now that the rant is out of the way, the throw itself isn't that much different in execution you just have to be smooth with it. I watch so many people throw other throws well, but get jerky and torque the shit out of Tai Otoshi. What is the problem specifically?,so I know how to do a bunch of throws using a gi, today I was practicing with a friend of mine using real clothes, grabbed his belt for a hip toss, his shirt and things like that.,his clothes just ripped in my hands, so I deem all gi related techniques useless.,You can use their body as well, you do not just have to grab their gi. A simple example is the O Soto Gari. You needn't pull hard on the clothes if you insist on using them, it is about leverage first of all anyways. Secondly, you can grab their arms, shoulders, various appendages, or wrap your arms around. Gis make learning easier but don't be fooled, this art is very effective without one. My instructor/Sensai did a very nice demonstration about ""street"" Judo just the other day.,kuzushi!,gi techniques will work if someone is wearing a jacket like in winter or something. but yeah i would certainly practice without a gi as well,imho you get a better feel for the technical nuances of a throw with a gi,Judo should switch to shorts now that there is no point to pants since you can't grab anything down there anymore. I would wear my sweet ass tapout shorts to show i'm real hardcore,still can grab the pants during newaza. A bunch of Kansetsu-waza (like rolling juji) shime waza (rolling okuri) rely on the leg grab to complete the ground work moves.,I've been thinking about it and probably it's that in my dojo almost everyone is bigger than me. The tai otoshi is one of those throws that you can not pull against a larger opponent without the greatest kuzushi of all times. I'm looking for a setup before the tai otoshi. I've read about doing kouchi gari before, but do tell me how do you pull it, man.,I actually try to hold my opponent by the back or over the neck, it gives you more control. Maybe you won't be able to pull a morote seoi or a tomoe nage, but instead you can do a koshi guruma or a sumi gaeshi perfectly.,It should be a weather thing. Winter, we use pants. Summer, we use shorts. Hell yeah, fashionable as fuck, man.,Quiet, the IJF can hear you...,One can only hope that the kodokan gets pissed off and decides to start it's own federation with the old rules. Only ippon, no restarts on the ground, all grips allowed, legs allowed.,It'd be like ITF TKD vs WTF TKD. WTF would be IJF, the watered down version that only kids play.,That sounds exactly like BJJ except with the ippon.,pls no,Sambo, maybe. BJJ and the IBJJF are pretty similar to judo and the IJF and they'll turn the sport into shit if the BJJ'er let it. All the guard pulling, berimbolo'ing, refs restarting and shit show how much BJJ'ers let the rules of the sport dictate their martial art.,Don't get me wrong, BJJ is nowhere near the level of stupidty judo got itself into, but it's on its way.,Seconded. I despise what the IJF has done to the sport in recent years. Seriously, competitive Judo has now become a game of poor politics, regulated only by those who think they know best for the sport. ,Some good comments are made on this video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srB,My sensei always tells me that two people in a judo match are like a rubber band, pull on one side, and the other side goes forward (use your brain for the rest of this),To achieve a Tai Otoshi from standing (both opponents postured up with no movement) is very difficult without very precise timing between leg and arm (which is difficult to achieve by just doing fits as opposed to the actual throw),If I ever go for a Tai Otoshi, it's always on people who prefer a bent over/defensive position, people who lean back or keep a good square center of balance are not good targets for this. ,So first try pushing the opponent, making them readjust both legs by using any combination of inner or outer foot sweeps. As they rebound back into you, going against your pull (think rubber band) you want to pull them into your leg for the Tai Otoshi. ,Make sure not to straighten your leg too early, often times people won't have the proper balance and straighten the leg to avoid falling, however, both knees should be bent, and the leg that is tripping should be popped up as their shin meets the back of yours. ,As for the arm motion, a useful strength exercise is cutting wood/using a sledgehammer. Think about the hand on your opponents lapel being below the blade, and the arm being the bottom of the handle, connect the two into a line, and swing downwards. It's a simple idea, but many people try to generate the force of the throw on their leg, as opposed to generating the force through their torso and using the leg to trip the opponent.,Hope this helps.,Also <3 judo,Start a competing Judo federation? Ju Jutsu (German offshot of Judo, most comparable to Sambo) did that. When the main federation ended Allkampf ('Full Fight') in favour of, err... Well, dancing contests, a shitton of clubs split up and kept going, even loosening the rules.,CHokes allowed, straight neckcrancks allowed, arm- and (Straight) leglocks allowed, full contact striking and light contact striking to the head allowed (Full contact to the head in pro matches, but those are rare), standing and on the ground. There's nothing the IJF can actually do to stop people from doing this with Judo, too.",gi general,"03/29/13(Fri)18:28,03/29/13(Fri)21:03,03/29/13(Fri)21:07,03/29/13(Fri)21:15,03/30/13(Sat)02:58,03/30/13(Sat)03:00,03/30/13(Sat)03:04,03/30/13(Sat)03:12,03/30/13(Sat)03:19,03/30/13(Sat)11:58,03/30/13(Sat)12:00,03/30/13(Sat)12:19,03/30/13(Sat)12:28,03/30/13(Sat)13:54,03/30/13(Sat)19:04,03/30/13(Sat)19:17,03/30/13(Sat)19:44","Anonymous,gi general,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"
"Any wing chun practitioners here?,How useful is it, really? Did you get fit from it?,Are there certain things I should be paying attention to when finding a place to teach me? Or misconceptions I should be prepared for?,You won't get ripped or anything, because it specifically relies on conservation of energy when fighting.,It's extremely useful, and even if you don't stick with it, the principles you're taught are extremely useful. Personally I've been very successful in utilizing my Wing Chun training in real life, or even sparring.,If you want to be well rounded, take some Escrima, Silat, and Judo, as they all mix together very well.,Finally watch out for people preaching ""sticky hands"" as the end all be all of training. It's useful, but full contact sparring, or even half-contact sparring is necessary. Finally, don't circle around you're opponent like a twat; keep moving forward and pushing into them; that's the point of Wing Chun.,Any questions?,Wow, thanks. Yeah, I'm mainly interested in wing chun for its principles. As for learning - is there something I should look for that will tell me whether the teacher is bullshit or not?,Very often I've encountered teachers for other things who have no idea what they're doing.,I probably won't look into escrima, silat, and judo any time soon because of money restraints but I'll probably get into boxing/kick-boxing. Would this heavily contradict with Wing Chun?,I have to go to the store, so post an email if you'd like me to give you a bunch of info. But just off the bat:,If the teacher doesn't allow sparring, he's full of shit. I can't think of anything else off the top of my head, but there's a bunch (like I said I'll email you if you're genuine about wanting to learn).,Kick boxing is an excellent addition for long range attacks.,Check out the ""Tao of Jeet Kune Do"", as it pairs very well with Wing Chun, and is excellent philosophy behind fighting in general.,yeah dude, e-mail me some more info,ignore the name of it... was made when i was real young,I'll definitely try to get ahold of Tao of Jeet Kune Do.,It sucks, there is no full contact sparring and conditioning. It's a poor man's Boxing.,How does it feel to be retarded and wrong?,Why do you even talk about something you obviously know nothing about?,It focuses mainly on trapping, efficiency and guarding center line.

If you want to share a video then please check that it isn't on the first few pages of YouTube videos for the term ""parkour"", as we've all seen them already.,http://youtu.be/FaPCHBVDnIU,David Belle interview, talking about why he started parkour and what it means to him and how it's bettered him as a person,http://youtu.be/M2sWvgsEXeU,Hour and a half long documentary on Lisses, France; the birthplace of parkour, and of the origins of parkour itself. Includes footage of over 150 traceurs,http://youtu.be/QH09YCtpKaw,Hour long documentary on parkour following five freerunners from San Diego to the Nevadan desert,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMpp,Be sure to stretch before and after every training session.,Dynamic stretches are generally better than static stretches.,Don't buy shoes with plastic on the soles or artificial support, they'll fall apart and hinder the strengthening of your feet.,Bodyweight training (calisthenics) as well as lifting weights can be excellent supplements to parkour training. Remember not to push yourself too hard--you should always leave some ""in the tank"" to prevent gradual training injury.,Parkour is a DISCIPLINE, stay in control of your body; don't be an idiot. You can, and will get hurt eventually, but that doesn't mean you should take stupid risks: You must walk before you can run.,Don't abuse the locations in which you train. Don't litter or vandalise the local spots. Make a real effort to leave the places you train better than when you got there. We want to show the world that what we do is a good thing.,Bompin' fresh new thread! I took a rest day yesterday when the weather finally stopped being amazing for a while.,I spent half the day today rolling back and forth in bed, too weak to get up. I've been sick with some kind of flu for a day or two now.,Sigh. ;_;,That sucks dude. Feel better. Your favorite spots will still be there when you get back.,Personally, I'm not looking forward to today. Five and a half hours until I have to get up for my 8am class.,I want to die.,Probably a good idea actually.,Hey /pkg/, I'd really like to learn how to parkour, but honestly, I'm out of shape. Any tips on how to best get myself to the point where I could learn to do this kind of stuff?,Overweight or just no muscle?,hey, i've been into bodyweight exercises and parkour training for a little while, love to just go outside and run around. problem is, my favorite pk spots (actually any pk spot near me) is public and where lots of people can see and watch me for any length of time.,is there any way to get over the fear/embarrassment of people watching you train? it's especially annoying because i'm more of a beginner and hate people watching me.,Go out at night.,I would but i'm in college and have limited time to do this stuff, i need to work it in during the day and i need to get sleep. so night/evening training wont work for me unfortunately.,It's pretty hard to get over the fear of being judged, but there's another way to do it.,Go to the public places when they're busy and ask people to show you the ropes. That's the big upside of the parkour culture--people love to help. A thread or two ago there was a most feelsy link wherein a guy with Cerebral Palsy was training in parkour and was just one of the guys, and that sort of thing isn't uncommon.,Trust me on this one, anywhere that people run is a place that you'll be accepted. As long as you're trying, nobody will judge you.,I wonder if it's possible to become a parkour bum.,Like a beach bum, but urban.,Anyone know anything about this?,It's a book about urban survival for hippies. It is outdated but not a bad read.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tXp,What do you guys this of this little video from SoulPancake?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jX,Interesting.

Bought myself a new camera, made up a new workout routine to get back into shape and I'm currently saving money to hopefully hit up the next big gathering,Threw up my first video yesterday too since I started training, I'm happy with how the video turned out but my tricks need a serious polishing!,http://youtu.be/s6r-Hp1lwco,Overweight, though not so much that I'd be called fat. At least, not by American standards.,bumping this,Anyone got any resource to parkour? I mean, just something to get proper form etc.,Thanks for posting once the last one 404ed OP, I've been at college today so wasn't able to myself.,Anybody else doing anything interesting over Easter? I'm going on a Classics trip with my college to Athens for a week, the itinerary allows me significant amounts of free time so I fully intend to fit some parkour training in that unfamiliar location, really looking forward to it.,Oh, I was also banned last night.,If you're fat you should begin by getting rid of the fat. You can't properly perform parkour if you have a bad strength to weight ratio,Ha! Brilliant ending there.,You could benefit from a lot more flexibility, so definitely get serious about stretching.,Ah this thread wasn't lost lol ,Indeed a lot of stretching is needed, just finished up soem dynamic stretching there about 10mins ago, glad you liked the ending haha,3 unjustifiably elitist 5 me,I've been doing parkour since October 2010. I live in New Mexico so there's not many places that I can go to do parkour. so I mostly run to keep my stamina up and do wallruns whenever I see a good wall. Here's one of my fav vids that I took with my GoPro at the University of New Mexico. What do you guys think,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NncO,It is a great spot but it's quite a drive from home. The guys that taught me parkour trained there but they opened up a parkour gym. It's a good gym but I don't get the same workout I got when training at the college.,lolwut,I had been hawk-eyeing it for hours because I'd already drawn up the new OP picture. I hope everyone likes it.,It's called Zero Point Parkour,So what? Lots of people starting need to go somewhere to learn the basics and there are people willing to teach them for money and a gym is a good environment to learn it when you are starting (mat on floor cushion your mistakes),That's the worst possible way to start out training, trust me..,Besides, we have a giant rock with a circumference of 40,075 km to train on that's FILLED with everything one would need to train AND train safely AND train for free.,It's filled with oil and rocks and shit. It's what's on the surface that matters.,Say, you copy/pasted this from some APK thread, if my memory serves me right.,So, what music do you listen to while doing parkour? ,I personally like Bonobo and Cat Empire, and some random 80s pop thrown in for good measure.,underground hiphop, mostly jedi mind tricks and so forth,Raver's fantasy - manian,promises - nero (skrillex remix),drop - east clubbers,Those are my main 3. I try to keep it fast paced stuff,Earbuds keep falling out and the last thing I want is getting stuck on something with the cord.,I have bluetooth headphones, myself.,Now if only I actually had some kind of portable media device. Anyone know of one that's functional and cheap enough for us poorfags?,Also, I can't help it. I'm all about Jshit music.,It's all I ever use. I highly recommend it!,Sansa Clip. /g/ approved and /fa/ as fuck.,has anyone ever died doing parkour?,people have died getting out of the shower. So yeah most likely.,Yes, though apparently parkour has a very low mortality rate compared to most extreme sports.,Also ,Maybe some cases, but they are very rare. The only person I can think of that has died doing ""Parkour"" was a young girl from Russia who had no idea what she was doing and tried to jump a roof gap with an 8 story drop. She didn't make it and fell to her death., You don't sound that fat so I would say just start running around, and climb everything. Tree branches are usually easier to hold on to than brick walls. Don't worry about form yet, you can pull yourself up with your stomach like you would get out of the pool. Focus on becoming more agile and building a strength base and the movement alone should help you shed a small amount of weight. You should also go ahead and start working on landings and rolls., Parkour is about teaching yourself not to die while doing parkour. As you grow comfortable with your body the stunts that look scary to other people become less dangerous for you. It's like learning how to drive, it's safer once you know what to expect.,DONT FUCKING RISK YOUR SELF,I had one of those, and I loved it save for one thing--it's battery life just wasn't long enough. It only lasted about two continuous hours.,It eventually died on me, though, and I haven't had a player since.,Doesn't that require apple software and stuff, though? I don't want to use itunes.,Only part I'll disagree with,Can't possibly agree any harder. This is the single most important thing about training parkour/freerunning. You're going to want to try to push yourself harder and harder, but you need to take a second and really think before committing to anything remotely dangerous.,Believe me, I've fucked up enough times in the past.,Yeah, nah, you're doing it wrong.,True dedication comes from training harder every day.,If you want to go without risking yourself, it's easy. Plenty of sleep, ample nutrition, and little to no drugs or alcohol... and definitely nothing harder than weed or caffeine on the drug side of things. Anything more than that and you're taking great unnecessary risks with body chemistry that, let's face it, none of us understand much if at all.,At the very least, the relative prevalence of drug deaths is a decent reason to avoid them.,On the other hand, I do agree with the partying hard part, though... at least insofar as fun is important to healthy living.,The general concept of leaving something ""in the tank"" is good in all training, really. I mentioned it in the second post, but maybe another line should be added... something to the tune of ""don't take a jump you can't afford to fail unless your life is at risk."",Picture tangentially related, sort of, I guess.,How do I develop air sense?,I just started doing parkour. I'm a track dude, and I'm in good shape. Speed's my thing, but I've always wanted to learn how to do flips and navigate obstacles quickly. In the little time that I have been doing parkour, I've found that I excel in climbing and scaling surfaces, but I would like to gain skill in traversing things. I can't Tic-Tac, but I can run up/step off walls in order to climb things. I can climb surfaces, but I can't Kong or Vault. There has to be a way.,Can someone help me get on the right track?Pun not intended.,If you want to learn something GO DRILL IT and practice it. Type in ""Kong vault tutorial"" on youtube you dingus. It takes time and dedication.,Don't listen to this crap, most of us just woke up one day and were perfect. I'm part ninja on my mother's side so it's even easier for me. My best friend can only do parkour because he was part of a government experiment gone wrong.,Yeah I hear ya. My friend Des came from a long line of assassins, and he can do shit just because he lied down for a few days next to a computer.,I'm a Namekian, so I SHOULD be able to get it though.,got back from the San Diego Jam on saturday, looking for the video that a friend made. ill post it when i find it.,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLdD,Nice trips bro,Though I still remember reading this somewhere.,Maybe Reddit in r/parkour. I've brought this point up there as well.,This had better be a recurring gag.,Sup /pkg/,I'm trying to do a backward leap through time, but I can't seem to get enough height even after starting off that big tower in Dubai.,Does anyone have any tips?,Buy better shoes.,What I usually do is wear a beanie which helps keeps the earbuds actually IN my ears and I feed the cord under my tshirt down my back and leave the music player sit in my back pocket, works well enough,For fucks sake..,this is what it felt like at the last pk jam i went to. everyone was doing wallflips and i decided to snag the bottom of a fire escape and dyno up to the actual platform. all the trickers tried to heckle me ""good luck getting down"",So it's a poor choice of terminology.,I never understood people who want to turn everything into cultish doctrine...,Just move. Do it your way, with the goals you have in mind.,I did not film it,thankyou,So guys, there's this fat kid at my school. He wears Nike Frees, and almost every time I see him he just does a little jump and yells ""HARDCORE PARKOUR"" and every time someone asks him what that means he says, ""It's like, jumping off stuff."",wat do?,Umm...ignore him?,The way you described it makes it sound like he has a legit mental disorder.,just ignore him,Can't make the whole world your problem. It's not healthy. Ignore it. Not your business anyway.,You're right guys, I'll just ignore him.,Not sure if this will help anyone, but I thought I'd share.,I do parkour, and a lot of urban-exploration. They seem to feed off of each other.,Regardless, I've found a wonderful little trick. If you have shoes with those fucking awful plastic shit on the bottom, especially right under your bridge, I've started covering it with one or two layers of medical taps, just to slightly increase traction, and keep from slipping while I balence, or precision on a bar.,Thoughts?,Yeah but only if you're stupid. Some guys in Russia were teaching some girls and they jumped from one roof to another. One of the girls tried it and failed falling and dying.,I've injured myself. Mostly rolled ankles and hit my feet pretty hard. The most serious injury was when I went to get on a roof and there was a nail sticking out. Cut my hand open and I had to get stitches.,who cares? it's free and you basically only need it to update your stuff,tell him to run across a wall,Well it's a waste of money to be putting that stuff on your shoes.

They're great and my last pair lasted me almost 2 years,I only do it like that, because I basically only ever have two pair of shoes, and the other pair are dress shoes,I just don't want to install a whole new program to do something my computer can already do.,Plastic shit on the bottom of shoes impedes the strengthening of lower leg muscles and ligaments and tendons around the ankle and along the foot while training, you'd be best getting Feiyues or some other kind of shoe without it, although if money is stupidly tight (unlikely, as Feiyues are like $20 a pop) then your MacGyvering is quite cool,MahNigga.jpg,I just got a pair of Merrell road gloves for 60. They feel freaking great!,i'm going to paris tomorrow, in the heart of parkour,anyone knows good places to run?,on everything. ,climb the Eiffel Tower, no stairs or ladders allowed, post pics.,What would you recommend practising to someone who has never done parkour, but runs a lot and does bodyweight training?,flexibility training, balance training, lrn2roll, climb walls, jump over things,Thanks man.,Bout to start a shitstorm on this thread:,How much of your time do you dedicate to conditioning as a traceur? Be honest.,Personally, I'd love to say 60%. But, being honest...about 10-15%. I'm working on improving that ratio, because I understand that training takes its toll on the body without training the underlying muscle tissue as well.,Thus, may I suggest that in tips and tricks we add a section for conditioning exercises, especially for beginners?,I'm a traceur of about three years, and during that time I'm lucky enough to have gone to London, and for two amazing/miserable days, I trained at Rendezvous 2012 with the Parkour Generations team, as well as one of the Yamakasi, Williams Belle. As per the international standards of things concerning parkour ranked by order of awesomeness, the training was awesome, the conditioning sucked. And there was A LOT of conditioning.,Here's just some of the stuff we did:,About a billion pushups,About a million crunches,Miles of QM, from standard to spiderman (really low to the ground the whole time) to inchworms (start in QM, push hands out as far as possible, slowly move feet forward until you're basically doing a toe-touch stretch, then start moving hands forward again), forward monkey walks (knuckle walking), side monkey walks, and duck walks.,Hanging from a wall for a set amount of time before traversing it,Holding pushup position while others in a team of 8-10 did a specific PK move ten times with perfect form (only break was when you were up to perform the move),Half a million squats on the toes,Holding chair position against a wall,Pistols (one legged squats, pushed through the heel, not the toes, while the other leg remains forward for balance,Sprints,Jogging,Burpees,Jumping jacks,One armed pushups,I'm sure there were more, but I've forgotten what all we did.,Needless to say though, it was INTENSE. But, as per PKG motto, we were there to train ""to be and to last."",Thoughts?,Bamp.,Fuck professional wrestling. :D,What's the best way to stop being a little bitch & start jumping gaps more than 3 & 1/2 feet wide? For some reason I can't push myself to. ,So like I said, what's the easiest way to get over this gutlessness? Just keep pushing yourself, or start of small & jump over high heights?,Both. Fear is natural, and overcoming it is just part of the process of training PK. During the course of your training, however, you'll naturaly develop the ability to overcome more and more fear as your confidence increases.,There are also several methods of increasing your confidence when facing a big jump by practicing on the ground to show yourself you're capable of jumping that far, and then finding ways to make the ground jump involve other obstacles, say a stair, adding difficulty little by little until you're confident enough to try the jump you're afraid of.,Any advice on catwalking and precision jumps?,Trained them today, but falling seemed like it was almost inevitable. :L,yeah, the whole doing it on the ground to see that you can is a good idea.,also, look up cat leaps or something like that.,basically, swing your arms forward when jumping in order to give yourself more forward momentum.,for landing precisions, squat deeply upon landing.,lowering your center of gravity like that makes it easier to stop.,Catwalking, especially on rails, is one of those skills you have to train by simply holding on like fuck. As you train them, your balance will improve, making it easier to stay on the rail. Until then, if you fall off, just simply hold on tighter next time and keep training.,I find that letting your legs go a little below the rail can also help if you're starting to tip over the other side.,To clarify, if you're tipping to the right, bring your left leg off the rail and let it dip underneath the rail to counterbalance your body, and vice-versa.,You can and should do much better than that. ,I have been training close to 7 years now (I'm 19). I keep a journal of my conditioning and strengthening.,Pic related, my page from today., I try to condition and work on flexibility for 2 hours every day, however, do not assume you can increase in skill by only training flexibility and strength. Keep in mind that the best way to get better at jumping is by going out and jumping all the time. Same with flips, vaults, etc. ,A powerful athlete is not a strong athlete. A powerful athlete is someone who can exert his strength quickly and efficiently. ,Training for the coordination and skill needed for parkour is purely a matter of forming proper connections in the nervous system through practice (Technique). Each time you preform a movement in parkour it causes the connections involved with that movement to strengthen in your brain and makes the next performance easier, more certain to the practitioner, and more readily done at a moments notice. Likewise, disuse tends to weaken any pathways that have been formed and makes doing them an act more difficult and uncertain. ,Thus we can only attain the skill we are looking for by performing the thing we are trying to learn. In order to make sure that the movements are the most efficient use of energy and motion, one must condition his muscles and stay flexible, that way the most efficient method for the movement can be performed without injury or restriction because of tight muscles and tendons.,I like your conditioning routine, as a personal trainer It's nice to see people training properly for their sport.,Keep up the good work man, you have a good mindset to be aware of your body and its need for proper conditioning.,Have you guys run into this image yet?,Do parkour.,I do have a thought. As a /fit/izen first, I'm sighing at most of that work. You may feel tired, but it isn't actually helpful for building new muscle. ,Though you seem pretty legit, I am not crazy about their conditioning drills.,Most of parkour is endurance. I do however also prefer a more strength-focused routine. Squats and chin-ups are what I would recommend most for parkour.,I knew Christopher Hollingsworth was on 4chan.,Well, there was supposedly that one guy they featured on ""1000 Ways to Die"", but other than that, of course people have died.

Been doing it for 6 years, but my progress has been a little slow lately, I think because I just don't get out to train enough and I don't spend any time in the gym, so I have nowhere to safely attempt riskier new techniques. Honestly, I'm a jack of all trades and a better teacher than a traceur.,Any other Canadafags here?,Pic related, reverse vault out of running precision (caption courtesy of my gf),is there like, a limit age, to start pk? or maybe a recommended age?,soon as you can run and climb,Thanks guys, I appreciate it.,Not here, but yes.,It's a surprisingly accurate portrayal.,Make him roll.

Without the ability to roll you narrow the scope of your practice as well as risk damage to your body.,Rolling safely and comfortably on concrete is one of the hardest things to learn. It's such a personal thing as everyone has different body mechanics, different boney parts to knock etc.,Start practicing!,Goal isn't to build new muscle, though, you see?

I just do. One of my fields of study is psychology, so when I see ""asp"" i just default to ""aspergers"" immediately from having seen it so many times. I'm not accusing anyone of having aspergers, I just think its gonna be funny when they start calling this board this.,That's what I thought too mate. Hahaha.

Maybe you can do tricks but it's not Parkour,looks like 'take off shirt' is actually Step 1,Most people go wrong at step 1 and put shirt one. Just don't put it on and you won't have to take it off,You know the more I lurk on the internet the more I think there's a bunch of us that do parkour here in Albuquerque there's just not really much of an effort for an organized scene.,For instance I had no idea that gym you talk about even existed. I've always just trained in the University area, downtown, and nature stuff up in the foothills.

The second one, especially, is a great guide to un-fucking the most fucked joints. If it's anything less than a full joint replacement, it'll help. I fixed my bad knees and back that way.,cheers for the help man, downloading those now.,No, it just means you're going to injure yourself.,Hey /pkg/, check out this move.,I call it... the bumpstand.,so /asp/, i have really bad shins, not the joints, the shins themselves. It feels like they are bruised but i can't see any bruises. I can only feel the pain while doing high impact sports and parkour is the worst. Anyone know what i could do to help this?,That's called ""Shin splints"",It's basically a type of strain injury, you can look it up on your own. The way to fix it is simple: Stop. Stop everything. Walk as little as possible, stretch constantly by gently moving your ankle in progressively larger and larger circles until it feels loose.,Give it like a week and a half, then start back up slow. Like power-walking slow. Gradually work your way up from there for a week or so, and you should be back to 90% or so.,Train the strength and flexibility of your ankles more, practice dynamic stretching and don't stiffen your ankle on landings--which a remarkable amount of otherwise highly skilled people do.,Splints are a bitch because the only way to make it better is to go low-impact for an extended time, but it'll be worth it.,A simple trick you can use to strengthen up the tissues there is to just get in the habit of standing on your toes now and again in your day to day.,Good luck, bro.,thanks for the help, its gonna be a bitch to do but i'll manage.,It really sucks, man, and I feel for you.,On the plus side, while that's going on is a great time to work on upper-body strength moves, since they put very little strain on your legs in general. If you put an object under your legs, just above your ankles, you can do push ups all day without re-straining your splint injury at all. Bonus points, it makes the push-ups harder, so it's good if you're already strong in upper-body pressing muscles. I like a basketball for that one, but if you don't have one handy almost anything will work.,If you're not strong enough for that yet, you can also just do half push-ups from the knee. If those are too easy for you--like, you could do a hundred and not even feel a strain easy--here's an improvement: Alternate between slow and fast. Start high. Go down slowly, should take about a second and a half, two seconds. Then go up, same amount of time. Go down slowly again, then explode upward, full-power, get as much height as you can without using your spine. Catch yourself on the way down and slow gradually. By the time you're near the ground, you should be moving as slow as you were on the slow rep.,Go back and forth on those for a few sets and your arms will be jelly, especially your shoulders and elbows.,Another one that's good training when you're injured, if you can't properly practice full muscle-ups, is the good old-fashioned pull-up. I'd actually recommend doing an incline pull, though, since it applies to parkour and free running more directly in my opinion. This is simple--get under something like a desk or table and grab the edge, keeping your heels on the ground and your entire body straight. Pull up nice and slow, then back nice and slow. Sounds really easy, but it's great for your spine. I like this one for parkour because it's more of an endurance exercise for the spinal muscles and will do wonderful things for posture, which improves... just about everything, but most of all helps improve your running stride.,A girl who tries is so attractive.,I'm someone different, but after reading through the push up and squat sections, that books seems to be almost exactly the same as this infographic.,Saved. ,/pkg/, do you swear I will love feyues? I have resisted for so long because I just don't trust this whole ""less support is always better"" philosophy, but I am a poorfag so I am running out of other options. My ankles get a feeling of burning very easily if I land wrong so I need good shoes!,I prefer the CC cheat sheet myself, since I like the progressions of it more than any source I've ever seen.,I highly recommend reading through both books all the way, though. Even if it's not a type of training that you normally like, you'll find something in there to improve what you do.,Best guide to strength, I swear.,In hindsight, I probably should also post it. Would help.,Most of my exposure to Feiyue shoes comes from my wushu days when they were the new big thing that China was trying to sell everybody on. They haven't really changed much from then though.,They are light, flexible, and cheap which are all good things. The grip is average to good on most surfaces, but rock/concrete WILL destroy them and quickly. I'd say their good for indoor training/acrobatics and maybe rail stuff but I don't know that I would make them my primary training shoe.,Lots of people swear by them though. Just my two cents.,Hey, guys, are Vans any good for parkour? They have a nice grip.,As long as you have them on and they look like sneakers.,But really, they are bad - don't use them. No support or anything.,Take Judo lessons.,Strengthen the knee joint. Do squats, all the way down, none of these wussy half squats. People call them olympic or high bar squats. They build the muscles above, below and around the knee providing support and strength to the joint and allowing your body to handle and absorb shocks.,About that convict conditioning thing... yeah, it's not that great.,actually vans have way more support than you actually should have for parkour. 2 thick 5 me,just start, rolls are a good thing to learn first and you can practice them almost anywhere,Really depends on the shoe. Vans makes more than one type of shoe, you know. From minimal canvas and rubber to retardedly complicated high-tech skate shoes. I used to train in one of the simpler skate shoes (Rowley Slims, if I remember correctly), and they were fantastic. Nothing fancy, but super durable and great grip.,Hey guys, to keep things short and sweet,,I've really wanted to start practicing free running, unfortunately I'm from a small town in the midwest meaning very little things to practice around. Just wanted to ask some tips for things I should be able to practice.,I'm wanting to use this as a cool thing to do and be able to bring my endurance up and get into better shape. I will be moving to Omaha, NE this fall for schooling there and hope to learn as much as possible this summer before I have more opportunities to hurt myself from lack of experience. Any tips are appreciated! Thanks,Saved, thanks,HOW THE FUCK DO I BREAK MY FALL. I AM SUCH A PUSSY IT ALWAYS HURTS AND I CAN NEVER START WITH MY SHOULDER AREA,jesus fuck lrn2roll before jumping off things holy shit,I FUCKING TRY AND I TRY BUT NEVER SUCCEED,What he actually meant is... literally, learn to roll before you jump off of things.,You start by learning to roll from the ground.,Try it crouching first, then progress to standing up. THEN you try it with a small forward hop, and work your way up SLOWLY.,Don't let videos of experts make you think that's how you start. It's a process of continuing growth. Nobody starts as an expert, so don't get discouraged... and don't hurt yourself being reckless, man, christ., They do have the right grip, but they are too heavy and clumsy.,*Unless those videos are tutorials. There are some excellent tutorials for learning how to roll.,From a muscle standpoint, I can do those fine. However, when I start to go up from the very bottom, I can hear a small amount of ""gristle"" in both my knees. Should I start smaller? Half squats are fine.,Slightly shameful bump.,Start with bodyweight squats. Again, Convict Conditioning is a great book.,Personally, I'm of the opinion that lifting is something you have to work up towards. If your joints aren't already healthy and conditioned properly, lifting loads them poorly, which gives you joint damage while you get good muscle... which is actually worse than just being weak across the board.,The squat progression in CC will get you from easymode supported squats--which you'll want to start with if you have knee damage, which is what that sound is you mentioned, connective tissue damage--all the way up through one-leg bodyweight squats.,When you can lift your whole bodyweight on one leg no problem, your legs will be strong enough to start lifting your weight, plus a bar, without hurting yourself.,Remember, just because you can do it doesn't automatically mean it's a good idea. Some of the worst training injuries are really slow build-ups to a big blowout. Treat conditioning for strength like a martial art: Start with your body first. Until you've got your body mastered, you're not ready for a weapon. The same applies to weights.,Well sure, and a very long time before that, too.,Iused to do parkour like years ago when i was a kid but ive just rekindled my interest. A few questions:,Where should I train?,I dont fancy training in public places just yet, id rather train for confidence first. I was thinking a gymnastics gym?,Whats new in the parkour world?,What the fuck happened to urban freeflow?,In all strength training, it's a good idea to use the simplest motions and lightest amount of weight for as long as possible. More difficulty doesn't automatically mean more gains. If you push harder than your body can handle rebuilding, you may be able to do it... but you'll get shit gains because your body will be too busy fixing the excessive damage. That's why you leave stuff ""in the tank"" when you train--never tire yourself out 100%. You should only do 50% on average, and always leave at least 25% on your hardest training days. Should feel refreshed, not drained. The idea that working yourself to total exhaustion is good training is stupid and always has been.,Anyway, adding weight to any motion is a surprisingly large toll on your joints, physiologically speaking. It's really something you should build up to over time, and not something to start with. There's a reason most power lifters have blown out shoulders and knees, y'know--they start lifting and they try to train up too fast. They don't start with bodyweight to train small muscle groups and connective tissues, and going into larger and larger weights too fast causes huge amounts of strain on the same.,You will be lifting 2x your bodyweight on a barbell with correct form way before you can do a one legged bodyweight squat. ,Do you realize that power lifters are professional athletes that even if they got other jobs on the side they try to win competitions for money, right? ,What happens when someone enter in top level competitions and try to win? Fucked up body parts. ,All volleyball players have fucked up knees, all tenis players have fucked up elbows, etc.,Hitting up an open gym to train some tumbling. Any other bros training today?,That's exactly my point.,You CAN do that, but that does not mean you SHOULD.,It'll cause progressive damage, no matter how good your form is. Form is simply not a replacement for good, gradual conditioning.,Small muscle groups and connective tissues take a lot of time to adapt compared to skeletal muscle. If you load that kind of weight on early, you'll get plenty of muscle for a little while... a few years or so. Then something will blow out and you'll be crippled forever.,You can't write off catastrophic, limb-destroying injuries as something that just happens. The whole point of conditioning is to prevent injury, so you should always start with good calisthenic form. It provides a more systemic basis than starting with weight, anyway.,It's worth the time to train up slowly.,They're called cat passes and arm jumps... fuck.,I'd just like to interject that I could do one-legged BW squats way before I could dl or squat 2x BW, and it seems to me that this would be the case with most people.,The issue isn't whether you can. The issue is whether you can without fucking up your knees.,This, basically.,All it proves is that , is the kind of guy who listens to his body when it says ""This isn't a good idea."",Good on you, anon, for training smart.,I'm still training up, and it's slow going for medical reasons, but I'll be catching up to you some day.,We will have to have a squat-off.,its multiple names for the same thing, i say cat grabs and kong vaults,one thing I have seen wreck people is the stuff they land on falling apart,you can wander around to check somethings,but only the obviously unstable will be provoked,where it is easy to check for a loose rail or wobbly fence just by pushing or standing,brick or stone walls not already broken will only fail under high load,no way to check for this,you will only know when it is too late,some guys wear a small backpack,and keep a battery pack in there wit 5 volt supply,and a small speaker,I don't like to carry things when I'm moving around, unless I need it immediately.,I'd probably go mad carrying around a speaker.,Plus, running around is embarrassing enough without everyone being able to hear my Japanese music.,I still don't understand people who do parkour but nothing freerun related, isn't it boring that the only progress you see is that you can make bigger jumps. Doing harder flips gives so much more satisfaction to me.,Looking for some guidance with shoes.,I've got two things going against me, the first is that I live in Australia, most of the brands of shoe's I've heard recommended in this thread so far aren't available here.,This mean's I'm forced to import, not such an issue but I can't try them to make sure they fit properly, that and feiyue's cost between $50-$80 bucks here.,My bigger issue is my feet... They're 13inches long and rather wide, It's a bitch getting shoes here as is, but the majority of brands that make suitable free running shoes don't make them in my size.,Are there any decent brands that are made in my size that I can import or maybe even find here in Australia?,Thanks in advance for the advice.,99% there is no issues unless there is pain associated with this. There are lots of moving parts in your joints and that noise is normal. If you are really worried, go to a sports physio specialist. Regular physio or doctor would have no idea - they tend to be afraid of physical activity for some reason.,If there is some pain associated with it, you should make an effort to learn proper stretching and foam rolling. IT (Iliotibial band) band is often tight, and can cause the knee cap (Patella) to track improperly (misalign).,Half squats are a waste of time,For Parkour a high vertical is key, Olympic style Weightlifting has been shown to produce athletes with great verticals, and great acceleration. Take a look at the image, Shane Hamman is a fat fuck, but probably has a higher vertical than anyone that commented on this thread.,You are clearly not strong. using the lightest weight for as long as possible will result in minimal progression,Now you're being totally retarded,Look under the section ""Injury Potential of Weight Training"",http://www.exrx.net/WeightTraining/,Your retardation level continues.,Best way to build useful muscles is simply by training whatver the fuck sport you're doing. It's more natural and works well and is more fun to do.,That's why no pro athlete ever does weight training.

"I'm thinking about trying parkour. What should I know about it? Is there anything you wish you had known when you started? I'd also love to hear stories from people about particularly awesome practices, times when it was was actually very useful for you, etc.,Pic related, I'd *really* rather avoid that. I'm going to start with just getting used to the warmup exercises and then learning to roll inside on carpet, or on grassy, softer ground.,Anybody?,viva la bump,wear a helmet when you test your limits so that when you eat shit you won't shatter your face,That's actually a pretty great idea. What about pads and such?,anybody? ;~;,Just work out. Parkour will come in time.,a helmet destroys your peripheral. dont use it. always practice with a friend, and systematically increase the sizes of your jumps and difficulty levels if possible. its 70% balls 30% skill.,Start slow and build up, biggest tip I can give you is to lose the fear and just go for it, it only slows your progress and holds you back, it is also the biggest factor in why beginners hurt themselves, trust me youll be surprised by how fast you progress,source:Me the guy in the photo,Stop worrying if you are ready for parkour or not and just get out there, join a group or something, and start doing parkour. My group has an overweight 40 year old that trains with us, for gods sake, and he gets better each time.,If your in New England, look online for the group nepk or pkri they accept newbies all the time,There's a parkour general you could check out.,It's incredibly fun. You should really get into it.,No. ,All you need to start parkour are a pair of shoes, does not really matter what kind, but good grip and no plastic supports are ideal. The most important thing to keep in mind is to master your basics first: landings, rolls and climb ups. Those first two are very important for the preservation of your body, and ideally you want to train them to the point of a natural reflex-action with no thought to it. Too often I see kids who can do mad flips who can't roll for shit, and constantly see them in and out of training due to multiple ankle injuries.

"Sup /asp/, I'm concerned with the lack of love for longboards on here. I'm here to change that.,Anyways, I have a quick question (and I'm sure regular skaters could answer this, too): I just put new bearings on all my wheels, but my one ""problem"" (shitty spinning) wheel from before is still a ""problem"" wheel now. Still just doesn't wanna spin as well as the rest. Is this a problem with my trucks, my wheel, or maybe did a bad bearing installation? Any knowledge would be much appreciated.,Also longboard general.,Sounds like the bolt is to tight or loose on the truck or maybe the bearing just isn't pressed in all the way. If neither of those then see if there's anything on the axle causing a problem.,Bearings are the least important part of your setup, unless you are DH racing, you shouldn't worry about it. Also wheel spin has very little to do with how the bearings perform unless you're standing on it, make sure you have spacers between your bearings too.,Rank in order of importance: deck, wheels, bearings, trucks. ,I'm curious. Mildly newbie longboarder here.,Close, trucks are way more important than bearings; kingpin degree, bushings, bushing seat and washers make the truck very complex, customizeable and important.,You got me wrong man, that wasn't my ranking. I'm asking YOU for YOUR ranking. Those were just the 4 criteria I listed (can't really think of much else unless you wanna get into nitty gritty shit like bushings and shit lol),Oh alright, Deck, Wheels, Bushings, Trucks, Bearings. Bushings just because I would prefer the same bushing setup on Paris/Caliber/ Randals even though I prefer Calibers for most DH/Freeride stuff,could be either the truck, bearing, or bad installation. but new bearings always spin really shitty before you break them in.,http://www.vxb.com/ballbearings.htm,what are your set ups?,2012 Arbor Vugenhausen, 44* Calibers with 90a Blood Orange Barrel bushing boardside and 85a Khiro Barrel roadside with a footstop and vicious griptape on S9 Butterballs or Bustin Premiers for DH.,Landyachtz Switchblade 36 with purple Blood Orange Grip, Bear 852s stock bushings, and Magic Bearings, with Abec 11 84a Flashbacks.,Gravity 41"" Makai Drop Carve,RII 180mm trucks,Abec11 70mm/81 (I think?),Bones swiss bearings,anyways, my setup: rayne vandal, caliber 44s, dbs bearings, blood orange grip, blood orange and venom bushings, checkers, freerides, cannibals,*$40,Do any trick! Oh wait.... cruise or die brah.,.... So you got yours for free?,Nope. Yours are $50, mine were about $10,obviously you've never heard of speedboarding, freeride, or freestyle,get out you shortboard faggot,sliding, early grabs, dancing tricks, hanging ten, longboard manuals, one foot manuals. There are definitely tricks that can be done. ,Try carving down a hill at 25mph on a shortboard tho...,Longboarders can go suck a fatty,Anyone out there who just cruises? If so, is this a good setup?,no, way too expensive for what youre getting. check out longboardskater as they have better prices and free shipping. also go for a longer. ,i always recommend the earthwing hightailer to people that want to cruise. its big but just a nimble because it also has kicks,a hightailer complete on LBS to your door for $160,People can carve on skateboards too. It's just harder. Which usually means it takes more talent. It's also not as safe.,I am actually disappointed that longboarding isn't really that big on this forum. Anywho, what's your guy's setup's? I've got a Jet Revolver with INDeeSZ 8mm bearing hanger, using some retarded bushing setup like Paris trucks stock bushings boardside and 75a khiro bushings roadside. My wheels are 70mm Yellow Zigs and I'm using some random type of bearing. I know it doesn't sound that good, but it's really fun.,Well it's still a new forum, so let's try to get longboarding popular on here. ,Anyways: San Clemente deck, San Clemente 76mm wheels, Independent bearings, Camino trucks (no idea if these are good, came stock with the deck). ,Yeah...shitty stock skate shop board setup. Currently upgrading the wheels and bearing situation now. Looking to get a dropped deck board, any suggestions?,Drill yourself out a shlongboard. ,Drill holes for the trucks on the nose and tail. (The nose is the one that's a little longer. And yes, it matters. the nose side sits lower than the tail, so if it's backwards it'll feel retarded. You'll see.),Protip: take your truck apart and use the baseplate as a guide. Tape it to your deck.,Try to get the front truck as flush as possible with the nose, but let the back truck have an inch or so of space. That way you can still pick it up, and if you do it right it'll stand up on its own.,amazon()com/Sector-Angled-Risers-Si,You're a funny guy OP.,people still cant their head around the fact that longboards and skateboards are one in the same.,so i think he was talking about the longer wheelbase boards with wide trucks and big soft wheels,At least grab a better photo for the OP.,Pictures like that are why longboarding is seen as super kooky.,(It will never not be a little fruity though, but that's ok.),Did you ride it already or just spin it a little? Maybe if you go fast on it a little it will be fine,HEY GUYS, I THINK YOU FORGOT YOUR HELMET AT MOMS HOUSE, BETTER BRING IT TO GOD DOWN THAT LIL HILL RIGHT THERE, YOU KNOW TO BE SAME. BRB GONNA GO DO AN ACTUAL BOARD SPORT,is $200 enough to get me a decent entry-level cruiser?,any suggestions? going to use it for transportation,bump,yes, around 200 bucks is perfect, don't settle for something cheaper and FFS don't buy from zumiez (marked up).,how about the arbiter 36? $99 deck, $209 complete,how tall are you? if the board is 36"" with cutouts for the wheels, you're standing with your feet ~ 2ft apart. if you're taller than 6ft it might be uncomfortable. otherwise it looks good enough, but there's better options. ,for starters, look at muirskate.com for your board, and then do google shopping to find the cheapest one,oh for fucks sake. justs go to longboard skater and get a goddamn Earthwing hightailer complete for like 170 to your door. or a gravity hypercarve complete for 150 shipped? LBS is THE best shop in the US to buy longboard material. then i would support milehighskate and then maybe daddies or muirskate,neverfuckingmind, MHS is done. damn im out of the groove,I got a question. I just recently started longboarding again ( I live in washington so not a lot of chances to ride) but I've noticed my trucks are heating up even after a 10 minute ride or so, is this normal? I have never had this issue before. My bearings are swiss bearings.,first off, where in washington? a few years ago, there was a huge scene up here, but all the crews split up and theres just random pockets of REALLY good riders out there.,second, when you spin your wheel, does the wheel sound sandy or dry? if so, clean and lube that shit.,seconded, clean and lube bearings. also check axels for rust/debris,I usually ride in the port orchard area and being a poor fag I only have wd-40 is that safe to use? I heard in the long run it'll fuck up the bearings even more,alcohol in the pharmacy is like a dollar for 20 oz. get and shit and or acetone, rinse into a pan and repeat with the alcohol in the pan until all the shit is gone. then lube with grease, not oil. or buy carb cleaner and spray the fuck out of them then use grease. i use engine assembly grease, works like a champ. i clean my bearings every 40 hours of ride time. so like every other week.,I have some of that stuff laying around thanks for the advice,oh sweet, i used to live in po, not much in the way for spots. but there are a couple of epics out there.,and no, wd40 is not a lubricant. its a water displacer and prevents rust in doing so. but once that oil penetrates the steel, it will push all the shit to the surface and create a layer of grime thatll hold water. ,if anything, is there any 3 in 1, gun oil, or even motor oil will work better than wd40.,whos got some mods they'd like to share? i modded the shate out of my 50 cals, and it basically turned them into precisions for around 5 bucks. i could post if people wanted. also, im skating a five mile a4 skyhawk with divine city slashers and the cals, beast setup.,I feel you there not much at all for riding spots but some of the backroads are pretty fun,this is what ive used on many, many, many sets of bearings, probably around 40 sets. Anything from ceramic to steel to swiss. some that wouldnt turn to a little better. a tube will last forever. i use a syringe with a 18 gauge needle to apply it to the balls. a little goes a very long way.,Lubriplate 105,salmonberry after the new pavement? awwwwww yeaaaaaa,i wouldnt mind hearing your caliber mods. ive done a few things to a few sets of bindings myself.,also, ive heard great things about 5 mile. the A4 looks like a sweet dropthrough. i missed the chance to demo their A10 warthog a while back. i regret that.`,yeah, five mile has some of the sexiest concave out there, i wouldnt mind trying the warthog. ,One easy thing to do is epoxy the kingpin in place, just make sure its straight. Also, the bushing and kingpin have some slop so i put a shim (like a piece of metro card or soda can) between kingpin and bushing and it makes there be a lot less slop. The last one is the link, its wierd but worth it, thats the only one im not completely sure how it works. Also, making or buying better pivot cups are a worthy investment.,Turns out it's just one of my bearings is seized up feelsbadman ,Hella dude I love that road and ride it each chance I get also the movie theatre parking lot going down the road into sars fuckyes,yeah, five mile has some of the sexiest concave out there, i wouldnt mind trying the warthog. ,One easy thing to do is epoxy the kingpin in place, just make sure its straight.

The last one is the link, its wierd but worth it, thats the only one im not completely sure how it works. Also, making or buying better pivot cups are a worthy investment.,http://www.silverfishlongboarding.c,i got ya. I shimmed out some grade 8 KPs on some Crail trucks. then i replaced the pivot cup on them and they reacted completely different(more predictable). I also face the inner race surface on all my cast hangers. i just use a pilotless endmill over the axel. also polishing the bushing cups on the hanger makes less hangups occur. this is all simple stuff that makes cast work flawlessly.,it really does do wonders, im gonna try the polishing. also, what degree are the crails and what do you think? im intruiged by the 0* ones, i dont understand.,these are the older plain cast RKP ones. 45 degree i think. i prefer the sabre 45 degree trucks more. ,my favorite trucks are the indy 215 with either cindrich 10 degree or the core baseplates.,ahh i meant cindrich. but i have 215's i dont use much, they just seem too twitchy and not a steady enough lean. might try them again sometime though.,i solved the twitchy feeling by running soft eliminators boardside and some stiffer barrels bottom. reactive but not twitchy,true, im gonna have to pick up some longer kingpins then,you can pound out the old KPs or pick up some Core baseplates. they come with a longer KP.,i have a wefunk foamie i'll sell for $200 bucks,is it a speedbone?,whoops sorry, not interested,go on, with pics,OP Here, yeah I kinda feel bad about the pic now. It's a lame 90s pic.... let's start dumping better ones. ,Here's one....not me btw, random google shit,Shortboard != longboard.,The hardware is completely different (decks, trucks, wheels are all different, only similarity is bearings lol). The purpose is completely different (tricks vs. bombing hills).,Most of the skate threads on here are discussing tricks and shit. Ollies and kickflips mean nothing to longboarders.,dumping more pics,now thats a tight ass,I have a set of 65mm butterballs, would those be okay with the peacemaker+polar bears?,i've been using a 925 with grizzlies, zealous, and mini zombies for about 3 weeks and it is noisy as fuck. haven't done anything too intense aside from some freeride and light DH (30-40 kph) any tips?,bumping, we need more posts.,TOPIC: Landyachtz Peacemaker vs. Nelson Stingray KT 36 vs Omen Sugar,alright, so for my first board ever, i'm thinking earthwing supermodel. what trucks should i get? i'm thinking softer wheels for cruising. is there a good medium between soft and hard for commuting and a litttle bit of sliding?,Sup /asp/. I just picked up a Madrid board from my local skate shop. I'm a complete beginner. Any tips? I get kind of wobbly when I push.,put your front foot at a 45 degree angle when you push off rather than straight,indy 215s and swap out for bushings of your choice. bushings are going to be the largest change, in riding, besides the deck. as for wheels, s9 centerset raceforms 80a. forgiving grip and predictable slip, without breaking the bank,,stingy,you should get some bones swiss ceramic bearings, the ride is so smooth,/sarcasm,indy 215s if your looking to do more freeride,caliber 44's if your looking to do more downhill","Longboard Thread,noko","03/25/13(Mon)22:22,03/25/13(Mon)22:25,03/25/13(Mon)22:46,03/25/13(Mon)22:55,03/25/13(Mon)23:02,03/25/13(Mon)23:05,03/25/13(Mon)23:09,03/25/13(Mon)23:15,03/25/13(Mon)23:23,03/26/13(Tue)01:18,03/26/13(Tue)09:19,03/26/13(Tue)09:32,03/26/13(Tue)09:40,03/26/13(Tue)09:44,03/26/13(Tue)09:49,03/26/13(Tue)09:50,03/26/13(Tue)09:52,03/26/13(Tue)16:07,03/26/13(Tue)16:08,03/26/13(Tue)18:17,03/26/13(Tue)18:33,03/26/13(Tue)18:46,03/26/13(Tue)19:18,03/26/13(Tue)19:26,03/26/13(Tue)22:01,03/27/13(Wed)01:57,03/27/13(Wed)02:20,03/27/13(Wed)14:30,03/27/13(Wed)14:33,03/27/13(Wed)15:00,03/27/13(Wed)15:18,03/28/13(Thu)16:37,03/28/13(Thu)17:43,03/28/13(Thu)20:23,03/28/13(Thu)20:52,03/28/13(Thu)21:15,03/28/13(Thu)21:46,03/28/13(Thu)22:30,03/29/13(Fri)00:22,03/29/13(Fri)00:25,03/29/13(Fri)00:30,03/29/13(Fri)00:34,03/29/13(Fri)00:37,03/29/13(Fri)00:37,03/29/13(Fri)00:42,03/29/13(Fri)00:43,03/29/13(Fri)00:44,03/29/13(Fri)00:49,03/29/13(Fri)00:51,03/29/13(Fri)00:52,03/29/13(Fri)00:53,03/29/13(Fri)00:57,03/29/13(Fri)01:06,03/29/13(Fri)01:08,03/29/13(Fri)01:09,03/29/13(Fri)01:13,03/29/13(Fri)01:18,03/29/13(Fri)01:24,03/29/13(Fri)01:26,03/29/13(Fri)01:30,03/29/13(Fri)01:32,03/29/13(Fri)01:36,03/29/13(Fri)01:41,03/29/13(Fri)01:43,03/29/13(Fri)01:44,03/29/13(Fri)02:52,03/29/13(Fri)03:48,03/29/13(Fri)12:05,03/29/13(Fri)12:08,03/29/13(Fri)13:27,03/29/13(Fri)13:31,03/29/13(Fri)14:21,03/29/13(Fri)14:24,03/29/13(Fri)15:51,03/29/13(Fri)19:47,03/29/13(Fri)20:02,03/29/13(Fri)20:04,03/30/13(Sat)02:55,03/30/13(Sat)10:13,03/30/13(Sat)10:13,03/30/13(Sat)10:14","Anonymous,Longboard Thread,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,lewelder,lewelder,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,sweet_science,sweet_science,sweet_science,sweet_science,Anonymous,Anonymous,sweet_science,sweet_science,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,noko,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous,Anonymous"

Kinda nervous. ,Also, ultimate is absolutely a sport. I have dreams of seeing highlights on ESPN's top 10.,Hucks just come with practice. Try to make long clean throws and gradually increase the power. Focus on your form, pay attention to the wind, throw a lot.,Can anyone explain how to get layout defensive blocks? I have tried but end up whiffing and hurting myself.,Run with the guy at his speed until the throw is released and then acceralate and jump into it as quickly as you can.,Yes. Yes. Dear god yes.,Why can't people appreciate this is exactly what it's about.,any recommendations on discs?,come on everyone knows that ultimate is all about looking good,discraft 175-ultrastar. get nothing else besides this. I know Inova is coming out with a disc soon, but it will probably suck.,Best sport out there.,i'd rather discuss ultimate than frolf,incorporate your whole upper body into the motion. like you are starting a lawn mower. practice is what makes it happen but thats where you need to start.,also a full on pivot when you practice because its easy to get into the habit of trying to get power by taking less of a pivot and this will make a slow throw very easy to block.,don't underestimate how far you will fly when laying out while running. and eyes on the disc if your whiffing.,Does anyone know a good way to break a well played wall?

Dane here.,how much does everything involving getting a license cost? +can you do wingsuit?,I am not , but I paid around $2,000 for my C license and around another 2 grand for my D license. I went through static line course. I believe it's a bit cheaper getting your license in the US?,fuck, that much. i realy want to jump at least once by myself...but i guess it would be a problem without a licence.,You can jump on your own doing something called AFF (Assisted Free Fall) 6 to 8 hours of training before one jump, costs around $800 and two instructors jump with you just in case you fuck up,Just qualified for my A licence and got about 40 jumps under my belt, loving the sport so far and planning on looking at getting my own rig some time in the near future.,thanks, will check out if we got that here.,I got my A last summer. Total cost was just shy of $2500. I am training to fly a wing suit ATM. You need 200 skydives before the wingsuit mentor will teach me to fly one. I have over 80 jumps now so I am learning to fly a tracking suit next month. BASE is on my training list of things to do as well as proxy fly a wing suit. You need 200 skydives before they will teach you to BASE jump as well. I am not rushing my jumps though. I am enjoying skydiving too much right now to worry about my total jump numbers.,Skydiving is the best thing I have done.,You can also do a tandem jump for about $200. That way you get to freefall for 60 seconds from full altitude. I went the static line course. You don't get to freefall, but you get to fly your won canopy down once it opens. Both cost about the saem. Tandem is like going for a ride in a car as the passenger, and static line is like being the driver. You are in control and have to deal with any problems on youw own. The training is usually very good these days.,How are rental costs?,I'm looking forward to going for my license but buying a the gear is putting it outside my spare dosh at the moment.,22 jumps here. on the verge of getting my A license. been a long road but totally worth it. i recommend everyone do it at least once.,I was going to learn, started with the Skydiving club at my uni and did the RAPS course. ,Did all the training but the weather's so shit and the number of people at the dz you rarely ever do anything at all. I did one jump like 3 months after my initial training and stopped. ,It was also the most terrifying thing and I don't think it was for me, but I don't believe myself slightly and I want to try again. I can't stand the doing nothing at all and wasted trips and money there though,I am, jumping tomorrow,lol no, you get about 30 seconds due to high opening,125 jumps here, almost didnt jump at all last season and did not yet this season because of a social fuckup.......
