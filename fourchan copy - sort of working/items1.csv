"This board is for discussion of sports other than the major professional sports.,This includes topics such as skydiving, surfing, skateboarding, rock-climing, bungee-jumping, BMX, and 'extreme' sports of all types. ,Discussions of professional sports teams, leagues and athletes should be posted on /sp/, and discussions of eSports should be posted on /vg/.,noticed you didn't have a tread on the greatest sport! Camel Wrestling!,im not mad at all,you seem to be implying that taker/cena would draw more than a match between 2 of the greatest icons in professional wrestling today,you sir are the one who is delusional,Cena turning heel and Punk being the streak will make news. WWE can not pass that up,wrestling will never be socially relevant you have the attitude era to thank,Either one would make news. I ain't greedy; one other other would be good enough for me.,Which is why I'm not holding out hope that either will happen. WWE most definitely can pass it up, because Vince doesn't give as many fucks about seeing business prosper as he does about having his own way.,The publicity behind ending the streak? Vince loves publicity. Isn't that why they book celebrity matches?,General skateboard thread,,post and discuss setups,most impressive trick you can do,loose vs tight,street, vert or freestyle etc...,this board went to shit rather quickly.,whats wrong spitfire and reds?,I picked up a Plan B the day before yesterday on sale for 30 bux with grip, skated it today, it's pretty chill,pic of deck?,So, I have a black belt in Tae Kwon Do and I'm a newfag at brazilian jiu jitsu, and did wrestling in high school. I don't practice TKD anymore, though.,I want to learn more about how to fight while standing up. What I know from Tae Kwon Do just isn't that helpful, and I want to get into more MMA type stuff.,The gym I'm currently at offers both Muay Thai and Jeet Kune Do classes. Which one is more useful for fighting and MMA type competitions?,As far as advice I would offer:,Tae Kwon Do is nice for people who want a very traditional martial art with memorized forms and more traditional elements like philosophy and lots of bowing. Go to a World TaeKwonDo Federation studio, though, it's the kind they do in the Olympics. They do full contact sparring (with pads), so you actually learn somewhat useful skills. The no-contact ITF does is lame.,BJJ: BJJ is a great sport for people who want to learn how to grapple. A lot like wrestling, but going to submission instead of pin. The community is usually pretty good and friendly and very helpful. ,Wrestling is a good choice if you're in high school or college because it's easy to access. It's an amazing workout and you will get very fit. The skills aren't totally applicable to a fight but it's a great sport for sports sake.,I'm here to answer questions about these sports if you want me to answer them from what I know.,most people would agree (unless they have some kind of pride on the line and refuse to admit it) wrestling is a foil to BJJ, BJJ may give you a better edge taking a striker down but a wrestler can more easily beat a jiu jitsu guy.,What? A wrestler might get the take down on a BJJ guy because wrestlers are all about take downs, but once the fight is on the floor, the BJJ guy feels right at home where he can start using submissions,the wrestler keeps mobility, they know how to work offense from the ground. Wrestlers always have an easier time than the Jiu jitsu guys when they are fighting. Not to say the wrestler will always win but the nature of wrestling moves give it an advantage,A lot of forms of wrestling cease the encounter as soon as they hit the ground. They have some of the same restrictions that judoka have in their techniques. BJJ does have substantially less techniques for takedowns, but againay art has its downsides. Thats why you study multiple things,You clearly know nothing about Jiu Jitsu,Come at me board-fags,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B86P,That just means they are sold out of the other sizes. Check another store.,Inlinewarehouse,Aggressivemall,Rollerwarehouse,Aggressivemall has a really good size chart which lets you know which brands require sizing up or down.,Alright sweet thanks guys, I'll check it out,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKGB,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d8o,gotta have some STYD,http://www.shredtilyouredead.com/II,Any other rugby players in here?,Is F1 an /asspie/ ?,No, professional driving sports are /sp/.,[D A T B A C K F I R E ' S D A I L Y A I R S H I T T H R E A D],Older thread is AUTOSAGING.,what's the best face gear that won't fog up?,Ifs made an m1 Garand. Not carbine.,your measuring skills are legendary.,I didn't take that, it's from the liquidation site I'm buying from.,So what does /asp/ think about Karate?,I've seen it mentioned in a few threads but it doesn't seem to get mentioned much here on /asp/, so I was just wondering what the rest of you guys think about Karate as a martial art? I currently practice Shotokan Karate so admittedly my opinion would be a little bit biased.,Continued from: ,The final thing I would like to say about striking in Karate is that it's too much work for too little gain. The amount of energy it takes to throw enough strikes to take somebody out is gargantuan. If we consider a boxing match, it's very rare to see somebody get knocked out in the first few minutes. The more likely event is that hundreds of punches are thrown by each fighter until somebody goes down. And that's just a boxing match. Nobody can train to stop from getting knocked out when it happens, unless your head is particularly large, the amount it takes to take somebody out with striking is not that subjective. Now, if we consider a life or death situation and what happens in the brain when somebody's life is threatened, i.e. a huge release of adrenaline and endorphins to significantly raise your opponent's tolerance for pain, not to mention their strength, speed, and stamina, striking becomes a moot point. ,Also to consider, a lot of Karate striking seems to be based on making contact with the back of your hand or the front of your foot. These are two of the weakest sets of bones in your body and you run an extremely high risk of simply breaking your own hand or foot by accidentally striking your opponent's knees or elbows.,Should I continue?,Please do.,Continued from: ,It should be made clear here that I view Karate as awesome in a sports setting. Lyoto Machida employs it very well in UFC, which I also love as a sport. ,Now, that whole rant was all about Kyokushin Karate. There are, however, other forms that employ aspects of grappling and joint locking. It should be first stated that there is a lack of emphasis on small joint manipulation, i.e. finger manipulation. Small joint manipulation is an excellent way to transition into large joint manipulation, but we can get into that later. Let's focus on the traditionally viewed application of Karate in striking as it transitions into joint locking. I was talking about flanking while striking in an earlier post, so if I would refer you to that bit before reading on. Or you can not, whatever you want. ,Flanking while striking does not only allow you to strike in places you normally wouldn't have access to, it also puts you in something called dominant positioning. If an individual is in dominant positioning, it means he is outside of his opponents attack, in a comfortable position after a deflection or a reception, and ideally in a position to proceed with a joint lock, whether it be fingers, wrist, forearm, elbow, shoulder, spine, whatever really. Striking, believe it or not, is one of the keys to joint locking. It not only has the potential to put you into dominant positioning from which you can use your body weight to dominate your opponent without having to expend a shit load of energy, it also momentarily stuns your opponent (if you're approaching this using the superman theory). If you've ever watched an mma match in which one guy is trying to submit the other, it becomes clear that locking is a relatively difficult thing to do. So, we have to assume that in order to break some bones, which render your opponent unable to move various portions of their bodies regardless of their strength or what drug their on, you would first need,Continued from: ,strike them a bunch of times. ,Most forms of Karate approach locking from their opponents' front and without trying to stun the opponent first, but rather throwing a few meager strikes their way that would only serve to anger them. On top of that, much like with striking, full body motion is under-utilized and you end up with two people using as much strength as they can to lock the other person up, which only serves to fatigue them, especially in the situation (using the superman method, we're assuming this is every situation) where your opponent has friends that are coming to help him. This is especially important if your trying to break bones or even succeed, in which case they'll be trying to really hurt you instead of just rough you up. This is a bit that I can get into later.,They have all 404'd, and we're left with shit loads of wanker skaters.,Anyway, ARCHERY TIME.,Location/club/Style/Gear,Leeds/Liverpool,Bowmen of Leeds, Uni of Liverpool,English Longbow,Aidy Hayes Performance Fast Bow 49lb at 28"" (Tonkin Bamboo, Pau Amarello, Ipe English),Photo related, taken today shooting at home.,Prince Rupert, BC, Canada,Eagle Eye Archers,Compound Barebow,Mission series Craze, Cobra drop-away rest, Easton 400 arrows.,Gonna get another hunting bow in the summer, so I can shoot further.,Hunger Games was awesome,compound barebow...? contradiction much?,clearly trolling.,Kildare, Ireland,NUI Maynooth Archery club,Olympic recurve,Samic athlete, kaya tomcat carbon, samic element satb, sabastien flute sight,PB indoor FITA 489,what obscure sports have you played /asp/ ?,i play korfball,haven't seen a BMX thread lets start one ,tricks: 360's, 180's, fakie of course, learning turndown, xup, toboggan, can can,rider: Mark Webb and Garret Reynolds,setup: Please no, my bike is sh*t tier,Op here ,You do vert,park or street?,Wall ride on the curve lol,Just yesterday, I was grinding wheelchair access handrails for the first time.
