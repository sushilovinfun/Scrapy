"Featured,People","Yes. Rebecca Goyette. If you haven’t seen her work, been jilted and dumbfounded by her refreshing take on being an artist in Bushwick, life, performance art and the ,—then you might be living inside of a seashell. I’ll let the words, the interview, and the motions speak for themselves…., We live in a world that’s in dire straits right now. Sometimes the last thing I want to see is dismal art. Do you think your performances bring a lot more humor into the art world, and where in particular does that come from within you?,Hmm, dismal art…it reminds me of John Baldessari’s piece made in 1971, where he wrote over and over again like a kid getting punished in school would have to write on the chalkboard: “I will not make any more boring art, I will not make any more boring art, I will not make any more boring art.”,To me, boring is dismal. However, I do not set out to make funny art - but by dealing with human sexuality, there is so much raw id and chance for physical comedy. I am usually motivated to explore an area of my mind, libido and preference that I do not understand or get at in real life., Do you believe that Bushwick will play an important role in performance art or act as a new Chelsea?,Well honestly, Bushwick is a great testing/proving ground for new ideas.  The DIY outposts of Bushwick are where many come to get juiced. There are some galleries in Bushwick that participate in the international art market, and some who play to a more local crowd. But in Bushwick, local cannot mean yokel, because of it’s proximity to Chelsea and the art market, so the work does get seen by a big cross section of folks.,The freedom to experiment can help fresh or more off-beat, less market-driven ideas to grow. This is very positive for art. Bushwick can also run the danger of being isolationist, situational or scene-based at times. I think it’s important that there be a fluidity between Bushwick and other areas where art thrives, be it in other parts of New York, or internationally. That’s where my mind is at, at least., Do you feel a sense of community here with other artists in Bushwick or do you generally think artists are islands unto themselves?,Artists are definitely not islands.  My support network of artists includes many in Bushwick, and from all over the place. My studio is in a small warehouse building in Bushwick, full of artists. This is where I have the chance to contemplate not only my own work, but those around me. I get to watch their work grow as well as my own. The proximity to artists I really respect and trust means so much to me., Do you see any differences between the performance art in New York vs the rest of the world?,I see differences in art around the world.  I was doing a project in Greece last summer, and got to know many artists there. There was a seriousness in their demeanor that’s different from New York. Culture definitely shapes us and our beliefs. That is totally fascinating to me.  We are products of our environment as well as unique individuals.,The video I made in Greece, Lobstapus/Lobstapussy will come out soon, and I think people will agree that the Greek men were a bit serious in the lobsta double-dick-speedos and lobsta-claws I provided them with to perform with me., What other artists living currently and from the past do you admire and learn from?,First of all, I learn most from artist friends and through all sorts of studio visits with curators, collectors, gallerists and with my performers and crew. And this is because of the direct connection we have in the present moment. But art history has other juicy lessons. My lobsta porn series draws a lot from surrealism with obvious connections to Salvador Dali. I also have gotten so much from , and his transgressive sensibility, and his use of sploshing, food and dramatic performance. I love thinking about ,, ,, , and , in connection with my practice, as well., If you had a kid and they told you they wanted to be a performance artist when they grow up, would you try to exorcise the demon?,Well why is that a choice between the two? Performance art is an excellent way to exorcise your demons! I just had a lobstapus (lobster/octopus combination) baby and he was born into performance, the cameras were on him from the start! And seriously, performance art’s popularity has to do with how we all “perform” in life to some extent.  Social media itself is so performative.,Also children need to be encouraged to become whatever type of person that they feel passionate about becoming. I was encouraged to be an artist by my parents, and for that I am grateful., You teach workshops in Performance Art at MOMA and I consider you to be one of the best and foremost experts in this medium. You’ve inspired me a lot. I’m curious though, have you seen many performance artists in Bushwick and what impression have they had on you?,Yes, I teach performance art as well as other forms of art-making at MoMA. It’s a wonderful privilege to share these ideas and methods with people in conjunction with viewing the museum collection and exhibitions. My view on art is so influenced by being immersed in this atmosphere. Through working there, I got a chance to meet ,, on of my heros. I was in the midst of preparations for a performance I was leading, which also involved 20 other performers, at ,, and I told her all about it. She passionately exclaimed, “Keep going!  Keep performing!  I salute you, artist does not just mean ‘painter who sits there all day staring at his canvas smoking a cigarette, drinking coffee!’”,I had to laugh, because I still have this weird inner-painter guilt, since I went to RISD for painting…even back then, I was creating performances and videos “on the side” while I struggled with painting. I am now much happier creating sculpture, video and performative works. So I actually have a similar chip on my shoulder as Marina. But I really love my painter friends and painting. I actually can’t help it. It’s in me.","Ana Lola Roman is an electronic musician, composer, singer, dancer, choreographer, occasional photographer and wanderlust.

,It’s snowing outside.  I’m in a strange home, (not) sleeping in a strange bed. The most stressful week of the most stressful month I’ve had in years has been magnified by a factor of ten by not speaking to you for five days.,Five. Whole. Days.  Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday.  Did I say days? It feels like weeks; months. Years.,In the course of playing the cards I’ve been dealt recently, I wondered if you thought of me. I feel alone, angry, abandoned. You made a very specific request for “space” (space? we’re thousands of miles apart) and I am determined to honor it.  ”Love, honor, respect, communication, cooperation,” those are the five keys to family life, according to my Dad.  I figure the guy who pulls off the 56 year marriage gets to have some say in what works and what doesn’t.,They’re saying it’s the worst storm in New York City history. Twenty-six inches in two days. There hasn’t been this much continuous snow since the winter of 1947, the year my parents married. I wonder if there’s a correlation.,It’s hard to break the attachment to relationships, even once you know they’ve gone bad. I believe we still want the same things, we’re just not willing to go to the same lengths to get them. I changed the rules for you, broke new ground, rewrote the script; you’re unwilling to do the same. Ghosts of scarcity and not raw unchecked desire still dictate your decision making process.,I’ve enjoyed a blizzard of emotional support from family and friends, and yet, without you it all seems like snowflakes on my tongue: transient, inconsequential.  Without you, nothing matters. I have always been here to listen, encourage, guide and protect you.  I’ve sat in silence and brushed your tears away as you cried in my arms. You choose to be alone, but know this: as long as I live you never have to be.,Did you know that the Inuits of northern Canada have forty-seven words meaning “this sucks?” According to Dr. Trisha Dean “language, like other social constructs, is environmentally influenced. The vocabulary of the Inuits reflects generations of living on frigid, barren glaciers.” Tingenek: this sucks. Massalerauvok: long ago, my son, it did not suck, but that’s not really true at this time. Mauja: for many moons, it has sucked. Now is no different. Akkilokipok: it is as if the great-snow tiger of suckiness has raped my sister.,To say “this akkilokipok” feels like grand understatement; the adjective adequate to describe both this god-forsaken storm and the morass our relationship has become does not exist in English or Intuit.,I choose to walk away. Clinging to anything after it’s stop nourishing you is unhealthy, and this relationship stopped feeding my soul long, long ago. There is a famine in my heart, caused by your decision to starve me of a love you created.,Tears and snowflakes, falling until dawn.,
,Do you also wanna see your work published in Sunday Read? ,.,By Natalie Keller Reinert,I’m beating her as we round the corner into the homestretch, laying my whip into her flank from high above my head, slap-slap-slap on her glossless hide. The rail is whizzing by close to my left foot, just at the height of my toe in the stirrup, and I’m dizzy with fear that my boot will rub on that hard metal rail and throw off my tenuous balance, losing what little grip I have on the little exercise saddle, or that the screech and vibration will send the horse spooking into the center of the racetrack, shaking me loose, into the dirt.,Either way it will fuck up the timed work and that is already going pretty badly. Just an eighth of a mile down, three more furlongs to go, and we’re nowhere near a racing pace. Slap-slap-slap, praying she’ll react, accelerate. Slap-slap-slap. She stumbles.,**,The horse is heaving and panting, making slow painful rounds of the rutted path of the dark crowded stable we call the shedrow. The hotwalker is texting, either his girlfriend back in Mexico or his girlfriend in Barn Four. Ordinarily I’d bitch at him, dangerous to have divided attention, that horse could spook or take off, blah blah blah, but it’s obvious that this filly’s going nowhere unless he drags her there with a chain across her lip, and anyway I’m too tired and disgusted to really give a shit about what happens to him. You can only chase these guys around so much and then it’s like, fuck it, get killed by some stud colt on ‘roid rage, see if I care. There’s a million more illegal immigrants lined up, begging for seven day a week, sixteen hour a day, way below minimum wage jobs. You’re expendable, kiddo.,I’m expendable, too, which is why I don’t go into the office to hang up my hat and safety vest for the day. I don’t need to hear Eddie give me a piece of his mind about the filly’s shit timed work, and I don’t need to hear Marcus, perched next to the heater with a Silver Bullet in his hand at nine o’clock in the morning, tell me one of his stories from his Hong Kong Jockey Club glory days.,The filly is dragging one foreleg slightly when she walks, but it’s tiny and I am the only one who will notice it.,I hang up my whip and saddle in the tack room, and stalk towards the train station still wearing my hard hat and vest.,**,C.J. Hernandez is riding her in the last race, the race the secretary writes for all the also-rans of a hundred sad slow claiming races, the race for the survivors who are looking for a little prize money before they break down. She falls at the half mile pole. She was already at the back of the pack, so no one steps on Casey. No one trips over the filly. He gets to live. A pile-up is avoided, at least for the moment. Little break-downs like this don’t even make the ,. They barely hit the blogs.,Casey gets up, brushes the clay off his white breeches, and waits for the ambulance to come and give him a ride back to the jock’s room. The filly picks up her head, and lays it back down in the dirt.,From my corner in the top of the grandstands, which hasn’t had a crowd begin enough to fill it in decades, I throw my beer bottle. It goes crashing harmlessly into the empty boxes near the balcony’s edge.,On my way out, shuffling past the cursing West Indians and the drunken old men, I see that darling of the racing board’s marketing dreams, a young girl with her well-dressed daddy. “Daddy, did that horsey die?” the girl lisps plaintively. Her father stammers.,“You better believe she died,” I tell her as I shove past.,**,But she didn’t. She’s standing in her stall the next morning, ears at half-mast, a wrapped foreleg hoisted sorrowfully over the straw. Eddie is leaning on the stall webbing, oblivious to the pigeon shit smeared over the rubber, crooning “Hey baby, come on and see your daddy, come on now babe –” Marcus is leaning against the wall drinking a Budweiser. He’s wearing a ridiculous yellow rain poncho that swamps his little ruined body, and his hard hat buckle swings loosely under his loose-skinned neck. It’s six a.m.,“She be fine in a few day,” he says to me. “She twist she ankle – no big deal.”,“She fell,” I say flatly. “Horses get up if it’s no big deal. She didn’t get up on her own.”,“Nah,” Eddie says, turning around. He smiles whitely at me. “Nah, shit, she’s just lazy. You know that. You gotta be hitting her all the time – you know she doesn’t wanna go ‘less’n you make her.”,“When I ride in Hong Kong,” Marcus says, voice gravelly with early morning alcohol, “I ride this filly, she donwanna go for no man. No man. She stop, she buck, she lay down in the dirt. I figure her out. I stand she up, let she look around, she go straight off and win for me. You gotta get inside they head.”,“You hear that?” Eddie says. “Marcus knows, he’ll help you out. Next week, get a good breeze out of her – she’ll race good then.”,“She can’t stand up,” I say skeptically.,“Oh we get her injected,” Eddie says. “That’s no problem.”,I look at the pair of them standing before the poor broken horse.,I grew up riding horses in America’s English countryside. In Virginia, in Maryland. Steeplechase horses, jumping horses, foxhunting horses. Tough, hardy horses. You knew how to treat them, how to keep them fit and strong through hard work. You never ignored a misstep, you never ran an alcohol-soaked towel over a dull coat to bring a false shine. You figured it out, and you fixed it.,This is Queens. Things are tougher here. The horses in Eddie’s shedrow are the same as the hotwalkers and the grooms and the riders: expendable. There are always more.,The filly limps into the corner of her stall and presses her face into the wall.,I can’t watch. I can’t get on anymore of these wrecks.,I won’t be able to pay my rent. I will end up on the streets. My mother will be right.,The next time she goes out, she’ll break down. And I’ll die.,I walk out.,**,She runs better the next week. She is mid-pack in a heaving mass of straining sad sore horses when she goes down. She takes three others with her.,A pile-up makes the ,Hell, it makes the New York ,.,I flip off the OTB channel.,**,There’s a four thirty a.m. A train I have to catch. I’m hotwalking for Joey Valentino in Barn Six now, and he starts work earlier. It’s a come-down from riding, but it buys bread and peanut butter. Valentino horses are gleaming and hot-tempered and mad with athleticism. They eat six meals a day, hand-mixed by a laughing, singing Jamaican man who has been working at racetracks since he was 12 years old. He says. Valentino horses don’t break down in cheap races. They don’t go down and die. He retires them to be jumpers, kid’s horses, pasture pets. He won’t put me on a single one of them, says I’m not good enough for his horses, but he’ll let me walk them and hose them off, and I take the job.,The siren on the racetrack goes off, and everyone in the barn does an instinctive head count of their horses. Do we have anyone out there? Could that be one of ours?,Everyone is in the barn; we were between sets of working horses. Rafael goes out to the fence to investigate. The siren can mean “loose horse” or “break-down.” It means the bored paramedics, listening to the radio in their ambulance, have work to do. It means everyone unfortunate enough to have a horse between their legs or in their grasp had better hold on tight in case something fast and loose goes galloping by.,Before Rafael comes back, the PA system crackles, sending my horse into a spasm of idiocy, and I hear, through my struggles, “Any available vet please report to the track.”,That’s it, then. Someone broke down.,The siren wails for a very long time. We’re all conscious of it, even as our horses settle and begin to walk semi-sanely again.,Rafael comes back inside. “Eddie Vernon’s gray horse. He die. And Marcus to the hospital.”,“Marcus?” I ask.,“Marcus riding he horses this week.” He looks at me. “Hey – you ride for Eddie before.”,“Yeah,” I say, jiggling the shank of my horse’s lead to keep him occupied. “Yeah, that gray horse, that’s Melodytime.”,“He die, that’s no good. Sorry.”,**,Eddie comes looking for me after training hours. I’m hosing out feed tubs, giving all the leftover oat hulls to the pigeons and the rats.,“Melodytime die out there today.”,“Yeah, I heard,” I say.,“Marcus broke his arm, his collarbone.”,“Yeah.”,“I need you.”,“No.”,“Come on.” Wheedling.,I don’t look away from my feed buckets. It could have been me. It would have been me.,Do you also wanna see your work published in Sunday Read? ,.,
Hell is carrots, you say at 12 am. I don’t think you mean it.,
The glistening wine that fizzles out of your lips,
when sleep congregates for other people, when the pillow,
never seems to call your name; questing for some elusive door to a TV show,
where your lust is a puzzle for another person to timidly approach.,
You’ve always wanted something crazy-famous to pin your name to.,
We call it Intervention.,Here is your third cup of coffee. The purple luggage under your eyes,
meets all travel regulations. Have another muffin. There’s no rest,
for the junkie now: fat diamonds dripping down your sallow cheeks,
from the metallic dreams you crushed in your fists. The beer aches,
for your hand and the eye drops don’t seem to ease the itching.,You weep like a baby in my arms and I stroke your cold fingers,
as if you are some whiskey-soaked kitten here for the warmth.,
I hold you and your head rages, the sinner inside you wails,
into a hurricane and the mirror we hold to your blood-broken face,
finally does you in.,
I want a woman with freckles,
dripping in her skin like a leopard’s coat,
like sunlight spotting the verdant earth,I want to name the constellations on her face,
claim her with titles reserved for the skies,
navigate her unknown terraces like Magellan crossed the seas,
touch the star drops on her cheeks with reverent fingers,An ocelot beauty,
I lust for her speckled breast,
I want to read with my lips;,my body itches for Braille.,Do you also wanna see your work published in Sunday Read? ,.,By Maria Modrovich,Boats are out these days.

Also, you can’t help thinking the driver is a member of a terrorist group. When he chats, it’s to distract you, when he’s on the phone, it’s to get instructions. You try to come across as amiable.,You wanted a cheap , nice hotel, this shithole looks nothing like the pictures on the website. You can’t understand a word the receptionist says.

You also, also stubbornly, order from the busboy. He doesn’t understand a word you’re saying. You immediately add the boy’s ethnic group to the group of morons who are on Earth to make life living hell for you. Now you understand why this country is in crisis.,Your local connection suggests you meet on Avenue C. You ask if that’s in the city center. By city center you mean the area around your cheap and not-so-nice hotel in Times Square. You ponder whether your local connection is a bit on the moronic side, too, since incapable of answering your question.,The place you like most is Pain Quotidian, the one near you. You have breakfast there and afternoon coffee; its universality gives you an almost homey feeling. Couldn’t you meet there?,You walk to the East Village and arrive 50 minutes late. You’re stunned it took you so long. On the map, it looked like it was really close. And you really are a fast walker.,You don’t tip. One, the service is either moronic or annoyingly servile; two, where you come from, rounding off is considered generous. Why should you care about the local wages? Why change , habits? They’re supposed to be appreciative you came over here to spend money. Don’t they even start you on the hotel standard.,While sipping your Weizenbier, you like to discuss politics.

Although, compared to D’Orsay, Louvre, Tate, …, you know, what more is there to see, really.,On the way back to the hotel, you avoid the subway. You’ve seen pictures of it – they were in an art show – all graffiti and weird people; no trust has been built between you and the underground transportation. Someone might try to blow it up.,You walk about ten blocks in the opposite direction before you realize it. You are afraid of people mumbling to themselves.,You agree to take the F this time. You hold your bag close to your body with both hands. You can still remember how your camera got stolen in the middle of the day on Rambla. You wouldn’t want to be on this train, with these characters, after dark; that’s for sure. The guy sitting across the isle from you has innumerous mirror pieces attached to his ragged clothing; they’re flashing you when his meaty body jerks in the seat as the car moves. He’s smiling, you are afraid it’s at you. You run up the stairs into the daylight when the train stops.,It takes exactly one hundred and seventy eight pictures of Katz Deli and various fire staircases until you get to the place where you’re meeting your friends.

Their shirts are much more … audacious!  (Audacious is a word you learned from an essay on short stories that the professor of your Fiction I class had you read).

I had the honor to meet one in person while taking part in an organized trip to the Baltic Republics. Fellow trip takers were so stunned by the presence of a vegan on the bus that they would stand in line at the bus alley to talk to her. They would share their food with the vegan and watch her eat it. The nights spent camping by the Baltic Sea were cold and the vegan refused to eat cooked food. So, people would bring her cups of wine, warmed up with their own hands. The vegan was permanently drunk. And constantly cold. Everyone was ultra protective of her. She was so pale and pure that one glass of wine was enough to make her drunk. Like a hermaphrodite in ancient Rome, she was special.,When the bus made a shopping stop, the mothers would send their kids to go check what the vegan was getting. The kids would run up to the vegan girl and more or less discretely inspect her shopping basket. Before anybody was allowed to touch their food, the parents would discuss whether this or that would be good for the vegan. The kids were sent to the vegan with small samples of food. Often, she would decline with a mild hand gesture and the kid would run back to inform the family that the vegan only wants nuts and wine.,The vegan had allergies to certain types of nuts. While our bus was passing by the beautiful white sand beaches of Riga, the adults were whispering the names of forbidden nuts. The fathers would write them down into their leather-bound notepads and the mothers would memorize their names. When by the fireplace, only the strongest young people with perfect teeth could sit around the vegan while she was telling the tale of her life. She was a second-generation vegan in the then Czechoslovakia. Something that was nearly unheard of. The menopausical women fainted and the people with high blood pressure were asked to leave and not listen from their tents. The kids were sound asleep by then and there was a changing guard making sure that they would leave their tents only when they urgently needed to use the toilette.,This is the moment when I would like to proudly announce that I was a personal friend of the vegan. I was near her when she ate and I assisted with the bottle opening. However, I remember only very little because the vegan was kind enough to share her wine with me. Those were very merry times.,Now, I would like to ask all the menopausical women to sit down and breathe evenly. Please, make sure there is no one with high blood pressure around or let them continue only at their own risk. Because the secret of the vegan’s shopping basket follows. It was full of the food the others would only touch after dinner was finished and the menopausical women made sure that everyone had at least three pieces of cake. The basket was full of FRUIT and NUTS; something that the mothers would encourage their children to throw to birds in zoos. And men were allowed to touch it only when soaked in alcohol. I remember an old history teacher mentioning that humanoids ate fruit and nuts.  He then wiped his thick-framed glasses and took out a schnitzel out of his lunch box.,I will be completely honest with you. I, the personal friend of the second-generation vegan, tasted some of her food. Under the influence of alcohol, deep in the forests of Estonia, while the moon was the only light, I had a bit of dried fruit and unsalted nuts. I do not want to speak about it anymore. Sometimes, when I bake and use these ingredients, I think of her ghostly cold white hands. We shared a tent during that trip. She was talking to me freely, addressing any topic without restrictions. I would listen carefully and make extra effort to assure that my response would amuse her.  I barely slept to make sure her blanket is in place…,An average looking man in jogging wear enters a café in the Village and ask for a vegan coffee. The man gets exactly the same paper cup of regular drip no milk just like me, only I wasn’t seeking attention by calling it vegan. People in this city have no shame at all. At parties, people approach me casually claiming they are vegans, munching on nuts and sipping regular coffee. They say, in a loud unpleasant voice:  “I cannot eat muffins! There’s milk and eggs in muffins. I’m a vegan!” And other people join: “I’m a vegan, too!” “Me too, I’m a vegan!” The room is often full of them. They inspect the muffins, spill milk into the sink and aggressively exchange recipes. “Who brought the muffins?”, they shout unanimously.,Let this be the moment of truth. I baked the muffins. I used two large non-organic eggs and a cup of watery milk. The recipe is freely available on the Internet. You have to type , into Google. I had to close the curtains while baking them. I went to a special non-vegan grocery store open only every other Sunday. And if you want to buy me a drink, get me an eggnog or a White Russian, please. I’ll be your personal friend. For this trip.",,,"

With the influx of bars in Bushwick’s always-residential streets, there’s been little enforcement with keeping noise levels low, and that’s gotten to many residents.,While the new rule is obviously not going to be too popular with area bars, it will be interesting to see how the policy, which is just advisory unless approved by the State Liquor Authority, plays out going forward.

"Featured,In the Hood","“This is Bushwick, baby – where anything can happen,” exclaims Willie Jr., the main protagonist in ,, the Bushwick-set web series. , is like the Puerto Rican version of ,, where everybody knows your name, but they’re not necessarily happy you came – and they’re not shy about letting you know, either.,The show’s second season, which humorously depicts Bushwick’s Puerto Rican community clinging to its culture and neighborhood in the face of gentrification – or as the show insinuates, the “oncoming yuppie invasion” – premiered on March 19 with a special screening at Bryant Park Hotel in Manhattan. The series, created by Julia Ahumada Grob and Yamin Segal, includes 12 episodes, of which only six have been filmed. A new episode will be released every two weeks through May on the show’s , beginning March 20, with the first two shows already available.,The six to nine-minute episodes chronicle the hijinks of Willie Jr. (,) as he tries to keep his sports bar a float and tries to win back his ex-fiancé from his arch nemesis, Albert. The show also highlights the many recognizable quirky caricatures of Bushwick, represented by the primarily Latino characters, including the bodega CEO, piragua (shaved ice) purveyors, local artists, family drunks, sassy women, local beggars, salsa music lovers, as well as the unwanted “hipsters.”, tackles themes such as unrequited love, family relationships, identity, stardom aspirations, sexuality, hybrid skin colors/cultures, fear of change, rising rents, entrepreneurship, and gentrification, which instigates a well-known divide between the areas “original tenants” and the growing ,. The show is filled with the authentic sounds and looks of Bushwick, funny one-liners, well-developed characters and great establishing shots of the colorful ‘hood we know and love.,Bushwick residents, as well as residents of other gentrified New York boroughs, will quickly see themselves in some of the token characters. Specifically, Bushwick residents will also laugh at inside local jokes, such as the proper way to refer to Bushwick (hint: not, East Williamsburg) or the silliness – or brilliance, depending on which side you’re on – of incorporating yoga in a bar (I’m looking at you ,).,The show does an amusing job of portraying greedy real estate agents selling small cramped apartments to young, non-native New Yorkers with the promise of being close to Williamsburg.,“I’m talking about the L train a block away, the JMZ two blocks away, Brooklyn Bowl, Meatball Shop and Williamsburg bars around the corner,” the creepy agent tells future tenants right before closing the deal by throwing in the ultimate “panty-dropper” – a kegerator. And also right before all three get pelted by eggs thrown by a moo moo-wearing, long-time resident hysterically screaming, “There will be no panty dropping in my back yard! This is Jesus’ house!”,Grob, who also stars as Ceci Rivera in the show, said the show’s target audience is the new generation of Latinos who are educated, identify with hip-hop culture and are between 25 and 40 years old. Segal, the show’s other creator and lead star Navaja, both said that the show is one that all U.S.-born Latinos can relate to, regardless of which ethnicity they represent.,However, , makes many specific cultural references, which if you’re not familiar with Puerto Rican culture (like me) means you will miss most of the jokes. The only one I got was the corny “Fake Anthony” name-calling referencing Puerto Rican-American singer Mark Anthony.,The show also depicts, and potentially reinforces, the divide between the different Latin American cultures in New York by overtly mocking Mexicans and jokingly threatening a Salvadorian in the first episode. “I’m gonna piss on you… I’m a make a road block, and the only people allowed in are Puerto Ricans. So if your flag doesn’t have that one white star—you outta here. You know why it’s white? Because it ain’t Mexican, playa,” [sic] a character tells Edgar, the show’s Salvadorian artist character.,As a self-proclaimed Texican (a Mexican-American hailing from Texas) living in South Williamsburg, one would think I’d easily identify with the target audience. Instead, I felt insulted and was reminded of the negative instances, albeit few, I’ve experienced from Puerto Ricans in New York for being of Mexican descent. I can’t help but wonder whether that’s the Puerto Rican consensus on Mexicans? If so, why?,I also felt as if I had to choose between identifying with either the Puerto Ricans, which are supposed to represent all Latin Americans, or the unwanted hipsters. If I had to choose, I’d probably choose the unwanted hipsters. And, as a hipster viewer, I’d probably also feel insulted with the show’s overt hipster-bashing. I understand these hipsters are bringing unwanted change to the neighborhood for long-time residents, but they’re also doing good things for it too, things that ,strives to chronicle while also keeping the stories of the original residents alive to demonstrate what a great and vibrant neighborhood Bushwick is because of all these mix of characters and cultures.,As Dave Wondrich, , drinks writer, ,: “[At] least the YUTs [Young Urban Tradesmen] are neat and constructive, things the punks and the hippies and the beatniks before them were most assuredly not… Hipsters might be parasites, but at least they leave the host alive.”,As with many new shows filmed in and around Bushwick, , has been described as an alternative to HBO’s ,, which was created by Lena Dunham. While ,, primarily set in Greenpoint and Williamsburg, is criticized for being homogenous and white, at least it doesn’t directly insult particular races or ethnicities. Rather than broadly calling itself a “Latino story” or a show aimed at all Latinos, , should simply call itself a primarily Puerto Rican story aimed at Puerto Ricans. It doesn’t mean non-Puerto Ricans shouldn’t watch, but at least we have a better idea of what to expect.,Nonetheless, I think the show is professionally shot, especially given its minuscule budget, and it has a lot of potential to be turned into a longer series. And it’s always great to have different perspectives represented, especially minority voices. It can only serve to give a more holistic view, and perhaps will encourage other voices to come forth in the future.",,"Bushwick,East WillyB,HBO Girls,hipsters,Julia Ahumada Grob,Puerto Ricans,web series,Yamin Segal","

Specially at work in front of the boys, if someone challenges me… And yous know how it is wit a dame. Some things yous can’t escape and that’s what I know.,I grew up in College Point. My family clan is from there. We’re Irish-Italian. I got pushed out to Maspeth to oversee a branch of pop’s plumbin business cause the Dooleys expand like that. Been in Maspeth since I was 19. Been in Maspeth for 15 years. It’s Queens–it’s where I’m from it’s who I am. New York baby.,Maspeth is a nice little place. It’s like yous in a village even though yous in Queens. For those of yous who don’t know Queens, alotta Queens is like that. In Maspeth they string the Christmas lights in December and have funeral homes for the departed. In Maspeth yous meet a cat young and he’ll be ya boy for life. Yous meet a girl young and she’ll be ya girl foreva.,My girl wasn’t my girl foreva though. Maybe that’s cause I actually met her in Forest Hills. Sometimes I take it there, to other parts of Queens. I took it too far in Forest Hills a coupla times and that’s how I ended up both wit my girl and then without her. She’s in Staten Island now wit my daughter and I’m sure to see my daughter every Sunday.,But otherwise I work and hang wit the guys. We talk about the girls we done, the ones we haven’t, the famous ones we never will – ya know, like Angelina Jolies. Just last Saturday I was at my boy Reggie’s. We was all playin beer pong and I can’t explain it. I got this feelin like I knew my life was gonna end…I heard things about the world endin in 2012 and the rapture from movies, like the action ones. I decided to make the most of it and smoke a blunt. Ya know. YOLO.,Now I don’t smoke that much. I’m really just a drinker, so this did my head in a little. I got the cabin fevers people sometimes get when they’re young and they can’t wait to get older, can’t wait to do things. Well I felt I wasn’t doin nuttin.,I thought I’d roll out to this bar we call the biggest little party place in Maspeth. Sometimes there’s hot young dames wearin tube tops, drinkin hard lemonades and whatnot, but this was a bad night. I hopped in my ride all drunk and high, lookin to get outta this town for once. I was too twisted to drive to Manhattan though. That was for sure. Instead I went down Flushing where I sometimes work. They got alotta buildins that need plumbin over there. Buildins for factories and stuffs. I never seen em at night and I doubted much happened ova there but for some reason I drove that way anyways. Outta habit I guess.,On the ride I thought about my life; maybe I could do more, maybe I could do less but ya know what – at least I was workin. All this thinkin made me paranoid and I seen some things that wasn’t there. Ya know, maybe I thought I saw the boys in blue or somethins.,I pulled over and wouldn’t ya know it – in the wall of some buildin was a door to a bar. Holy shit, I says to myself – I didn’t know they had bars round here.,I went inside to take a look, cause ya know – YOLO. There were all sortsa freaks. Guys in girls jeans, girls in boys shirts wit the checkers on em. One girl had her head shaved and then one dame had hair so long she was sittin on it. I took my place and ordered a Bud but they told me they didn’t have Bud so I says, “Give me the next best thing,” and they gave me some PBR. I was like, Ya know what? That’s good enough for me. Pops drank PBR back before the cancer. Back before the nursin home in Rego Park.,So then this dame comes up to me. She wasn’t sloppy like the girls in Maspeth with their stuffs hangin out, but somehow sloppy like she didn’t brush her hair or somethin. She was wearin these huge glasses like she had serious eye problems so I kinda felt bad for her at first. But then she had on some tight shiny shift wit some dude’s shirt all unbuttoned ova it. I was thinkin – Whose shirt is that? Well, she just rolled right up to me like it was nuttin and she goes, “Um, you’re not from around here, are you?”,Who was she talkin to? Me?! I’m a member of the Dooley clan!,“Not from around here?” I says. “What are ya talkin bout I live right up the road. Are yous from round here?”,“Yeah, I live around the corner.”,“But yous grew up here?”,“No. I grew up in Connecticut.”,“But ya from here?”,“Yeah. I just said I live right around the corner.”,Oh man. I was missin somethin.,Next thing I know she’s talkin to me like, What are you doing over here? And What do you do for a living? I get to tellin her bout the plumbin. How I grew up in Queens. How I was high and checkin out this hood…I was lookin for somethin new since I was stoned wit the cabin fevers and boy did I find it: a bar where people take a shot of whiskey and then follow it wit a shot of juice from a freakin picklejar! People got some strange customs in other hoods, let me tell ya.,She starts talkin to me wit some dreamy voice like she high too, sayin things like, “Queens, I never go to Queens,” and “You know I’ve never hooked up with a guy like you before.” She starts tellin me bout this pizza joint round the corner where they put a farm-on-the-table, whateva that means. She says the brick oven is legit. She says it’s the best freakin pizza in New York City. Then she all flirty and surprised like, “You haven’t been there? Everyone knows it though…it’s the best. SO many writeups.” So I says, “You eva go to Rosas in Maspeth? It don’t need no writeups.”,She shot me a snotty look and says, “Um, no.” And I say, “But it’s right there. In Maspeth. It’s like, a mile away. C’mon! Everybody know Rosas!!”,We go back and forth talkin like we know our pizza better than the other, even though we never tried the other or even hearda it – but it don’t matter cause I know I’m right anyways. Then she just starts makin out wit me outta nowheres! She goes, “You wanna go for a walk?” I told her not really. She tells me how there’s another great bar in the area and how there’s a sushi joint open late or somethins and I’m like, “Nah, I don’t need to see any a that uncooked fish stuffs.” Then she says to me, she goes, “I gotta run. You should come pick me up later. But my ex-boyfriend is crashing at mine so you have to wait until he falls asleep to get me. I’ll call you. Take me back to yours and show me Maspeth.”,I was like, WOAH. Okay. That sounds like a plan even though she’s kinda snobby and maybe hasn’t washed her hair in the past coupla days. Maybe I could talk her into startin out in the showa first, rub in some Head n Shoulders and then we take it to the bedroom. I give her my number and didn’t have no other place to go. I figured I’d chill at mine for a hot second while I waited for her to call. It was only a five minute drive anyways.,Needless to say when I got home I was freakin tired. I fell asleep on my couch after smokin a cigarette, drinkin a Coors Light and watchin recaps from the game. I woke up the next day and checked my phone, worried maybe I missed out on showin this dame a good time. Showin her Maspeth, real New York and Rosas. But as it turned out she neva called me anyway. I guess it’s just who we are, ya know?",,"Bushwick,Cat Agonis,Shanon Weltman,Short story,Sunday Read","

In the Hood,"Last week we told you the ways ,‘. In our comments section, readers ended up showing some love for its parallel sister train, the J! Though it has a bad rap, the J/M/Z  train line is actually pretty dope- it runs frequently, rarely has back-ups and delays like the L and it spans a lot of territory. While the L train has its selling points, here are quite a few ways the J train totally trumps the L., Do you like it when your train is harder to get into than a Saturday at the Boom Boom Room? –Of course you don’t!! While the J train isn’t exactly a picnic at McCarren Park during rush hour, it  feels like one compared to the L, which is just a straight up sardine-can. You can stand without touching at least 3 undesirable characters, or even (gasp!) grab a seat!, , As commenter Sean pointed out on last week’s article, “One thing I always enjoyed about the J train was cell-service while riding into Manhattan. Always offered the chance to pop off those ‘I’m running late’ texts and simultaneously blame the J” (in real time).  Nuff’ said, Sean. Nuff said. Riding this line frees up some great email-checking time, too., If you live between the Myrtle and Marcy stops, not only do you have the J, you have the M train. During the week, the M brings you to essential spots in Manhattan like the LES, and if you’re about the office kind of life, places like Rockefeller Center. But even if you don’t live off these stops, fret not–you can still catch the M from any of these stations on the exact same platform which is simply grand for those of us who don’t like doing their cardio on subway stairs., The J/M/Z train has a breathtaking ride over the Williamsburg bridge, with views of Manhattan’s east side and all the way down to the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges. It’s a little know benefit of train riding that has yet to make it into a tourist tips guidebook ., Know what friggin sucks? Traveling on a long-ass trip where you missed your layover and then you have to take multiple trains to get home at 1 in the a.m. At least if you live off the J, you can take it direct to the AirTrain to get to & fro to JFK instead of lifting your damn suitcase up and down a bajillion stairs at Broadway Junction. Hopefully you’re going to the JetBlue terminal to enjoy some cocktails and the Boar’s Head kiosk: an O.G. of Bushwick!, The J runs express, and the Z runs even more express. Seriously, L. Get it together.,So what do YOU think? Does the J train trump the L overall? Which line do you prefer? Drop a note in the comments to get the conversation going!","To me, life is meant to be classy-trashy. Nothing’s better than bouncing from a rooftop terrace-soiree and rolling into a warehouse party in the same leopard-print dress.

That’s what I’ve learned about it all. I can’t escape bein a man. I get jealous and tight sometimes. Specially at work in front of the boys, if someone challenges me… And yous know how it is wit a dame. Some things yous can’t escape and that’s what I know.,I grew up in College Point. My family clan is from there. We’re Irish-Italian. I got pushed out to Maspeth to oversee a branch of pop’s plumbin business cause the Dooleys expand like that. Been in Maspeth since I was 19.

New York baby., ,We are over the moon here at , because last night we won a third place Ippies Journalism Award for the best photograph!, ,I desperately want to say yes to this question, but I really don’t think it’s true for a lot of women. I admire women who are capable of sleeping with someone for the hell of it, but I don’t think it happens as often as the ladies let on. It’s just not cool to say you want to have a relationship with the person you’ve had sex with. If you go there, people will think you’re weak and needy. Ugh!, ,Sunday night 19 artists converged in , to compete against one another in a Bob Ross landscape painting takedown.  You may be familiar with the popular , competitions that pit amateur cooks against one another in an attempt to win audience votes and street cred. In the 10 years since its inception, the Takedowns have morphed to include a variety of foods from avocados to cookies! This, however, was the first Takedown that wasn’t culinary, and what better place to host a paint-off than in Bushwick? The Active Space was set up with 19 easels facing the front of the room where repeat episodes of Bob Ross were projected on a screen. Each artist had 1 hour to create their version of a Bob Ross landscape for the chance to win the audience vote and $250 worth of art supplies from Utrecht. That’s a prize worth fighting for.,Last week we told you the ways ,‘. In our comments section, readers ended up showing some love for its parallel sister train, the J!

Why do we love it? Well, the answers are obvious! Everyone wants access to easy train transfers, and Union Square is on the line. If you’re like everyone else who lives in Brooklyn and into food and bars, there are a plethora of sweet places to fill up near most every L stop. It’s basically a fashion show, with outfits and makeup worthy of a half-baked red train carpet. It’s also a way to get where you’re going and take in some serious eye candy at the same time. But holdup! The L train isn’t all wine n’ roses either. Ever heard of , ? Let’s all commiserate for a hot second on how trifling this train can be. Damn you, L!",,,"

Arts and Culture,"s ,, there was Williamsburg/Bushwick-based web series ,from creator ,.  The series hilariously captures the exasperation of being a single and lonely hipster in New York, as well as the struggles of financially surviving as a freelancer – all within five-minute webisodes. The show has been compared to the likes of ,, ,, ,, ,, and of course, the inevitable referral to ,. Unlike ,, however, , is from a low-budget show from a man’s point of view, more like two dudes gathering laundry and complaining about how dirty the subway is.,Season one, which first aired in January last year, begins with the end of Rob’s relationship, where he is shoved into the depths of the big New York singles sea. This quote, from the protagonist, sums up the sappy view this sensitive guy has on true love:,“I hate parties. I don’t want to do that. I want to go home, stay at home,” Rob sulks to a friend in episode one. “The other day, together, we baked two pumpkin pies and ate both of them in two days – that’s love.”,We sat down with Hugel himself for an exclusive Q+A.,“I moved here, got into a relationship quickly, a four-five month thing, it ended and I suddenly realized ‘I live here and I don’t have many friends.’ I had friends, but no best buds or a strong community. The harsh reality was ‘I’m lonely.’ And I didn’t want to do the regular and popular thing, like go out a lot and celebrate being single.”,During that period, the Virginia native was freelancing various video production gigs and working retail to earn a living. This left Hugel with a lot of free time on his hands at odd hours while everyone else was working full-time jobs. This explains why Rob, the show’s protagonist, is often left wandering around Williamsburg and even befriends his banker.,Hugel does an extraordinary job of developing Rob’s character in those five-minute episodes, probably because he was that lonely and naive Rob at a previous point in his life. As a viewer, you sympathize with Rob, feel sorry for him and understand his love-hate relationship with New York, all while rooting for him; you want Rob to get over his girlfriend, move on and find a good job and a girl. In short, , is addicting for their sheer relatability, especially since the episodes are so short. They’re almost like vignettes, or days-in-the-life of your single best friend.,The series also does an excellent job of illustrating those self-conscious, lack-of-financial stability moments I’m sure many residents in our neighborhood can relate to, like dealing with that cute girl working for the , asking if you like children.,“How do you guys afford to get brunch every single week,” Rob asks in episode two after being obligated to at least order an orange juice at a restaurant.,“We have jobs,” Rob’s friends respond.,“I have ,. I have multiple video production jobs…They just don’t happen, you know, on a normal time frame,” Rob says.,Hugel said, while , is based on his life, it’s not entirely true. He says the story lines veer off into decisions he wishes he’d made or that will be more interesting for the show. While the show may share many similarities to HBO’s ,, including the setting, Hugel said he is inspired by shows like ,, ,(UK version), and ,Hugel began scripting , in 2010 after taking several improv courses at the , (UCB), and editing and producing ,web series, which is created by , and ,. He began filming the episodes in 2011. However, a year passed before he was able to release them.,“I wanted to do it like TV, where a season gets shot, you edit it, and release it. But it was difficult because the process of filming was slow,” Hugel said. “But it was worth the wait.”,Before Hugel finished filming and editing the entire series, before releasing it on ,, and long before , premiered, he submitted some of the episodes to the , in 2011. The show won the Audience Choice Award.,“I had never done a festival, never shown anything I had made, especially something that was so personal and which I had put so much effort into. Winning inspired me to make more,” Hugel said.,Since its release, , has received more than 4 million views. Hugel has also created more content, including the , where he offers relationship advice, spin-off show ,and , where Hugel - the real Rob – discusses whatever he wants. He’s also working on another spin-off show, ,The show,was also screened before each episode of , at , Bar in Williamsburg.,Season one ends with Rob joining a singles-cult full of men who live on a secret boat learning to embrace singledom, reminiscent of , ridiculous circle of pickup artists. Will Rob regain his mojo? Will he stop being a vegetarian? Will he win his ex-girlfriend back? You’ll have to keep watching to find out. And, in case you’re wondering whether Hugel is single. Sorry gals, he’s been in a relationship for five years.

If you bring a ball or frizbee, prepare for it to be communally devoured. There’s some big energy from all those excited pups. That’s not to deter the more senior members of our canine community—there’s room for you too, if you can tolerate all those silly juniors., , ",,"Bushwick,dog run,Maria Hernandez Park,pets","
